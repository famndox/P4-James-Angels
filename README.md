sharing, but so far just an attempt at a TensorFlow tutorial using RNN layer - https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation

next step is to do the tutorial using the LSTM layter model from <packt> - https://hub.packtpub.com/tensorflow-lstm-that-writes-stories-tutorial/

note the code for the above can be found here: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow/blob/master/ch8/lstms_for_text_generation.ipynb

however, I'm running into issues because it's using an older rev of TF, updating w/o comprehension is difficult

see gdoc for notes
