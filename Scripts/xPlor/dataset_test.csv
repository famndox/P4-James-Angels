A very interesting story was once told me of a King who built a splendid church. It took the architects seven years to finish the building. The King went to dedicate the church and to pray in it and lo there was a fog so dense that the King was almost suffocated. In the very midst of the dense fog a monk stood before the King sayingLong live the King You have built a fine church but it lacks one thing.The monk then quickly disappeared. The King came out and ordered his men to take down the building and to put up another one finer than the first. It took them another seven years to finish the second building. The King again went to dedicate the church and pray in it and lo again there was a dense fog and the same monk stood before the King sayingLong live the King You have built a beautiful church but it lacks one thing.Again the monk mysteriously disappeared. The King again ordered his men to take down the building and to put up a new one. It took them another seven years to finish the third building and it was this time so splendid that there was nothing like it in all the world. The King again went to dedicate it and to pray in it and lo again there was a dense fog and the same monk stood before the King sayingLong live the King You have built a church incomparably beautiful but it lacks one thing.The monk was again about to make his exit when the King took hold of his collar sayingTell me what is the one thing lacking in my church. This is the third time that you compel me to take down my building upon which so much labor and time have been spent.The Fairy Nightingale is the only thing that is lacking in this magnificent church said the monk and disappeared in the fog.The King returned to his palace and thereafter was very sad. He had three sons who seeing their father sad askedLong live the King What grieves you fatherMy sons said the King I am getting old and the Fairy Nightingale is needed for the church. I do not know how to get it.Be of good cheer father said the lads we will go and bring it.And they started. After a long journey they came to a place where the road divided into three branches with a sign on each. The sign of the broad road wasHe who goes on this road returns safely. The sign on the middle road wasHe who goes on this road may return or may not return. And the sign on the third narrow road wasHe who goes on this road never returns. The oldest brother took the broad road the second brother took the middle road and the youngest brother took the narrow road. The oldest lad soon came to a large city at sight of which he said to himselfWhy should I go farther and be killed I would better stay in this place. And he became a servant in one of the inns of the city.The second brother turned toward the other side of the mountain and came to a green meadow with shady trees here and there and benches under the trees. He was tired and at once sat down upon one of the benches. Soon a giant as black as night came along with an iron rod in his hand. He gave the lad one stroke with the rod and lo the lad turned into a round stone and rolled under the bench.The youngest of the three brothers started on the road along which there could be no return. A dense fog covered him and lo the monk who had talked with his father appeared to him sayingGod speed thee son Whither are you goingI am going to bring the Fairy Nightingale for our new church said the lad.Good said the monk but this way is dangerous let me advise you. The owner of the Fairy Nightingale is the Fairy Queen a very beautiful maiden. On your way you will soon come to a river which the Fairy Queen has by her arts changed into a poisoned stream and she does not drink of it. But you must drink of it and say O happy this is the water of immortality. After crossing the river you will come to a grove which the queen has changed into a jungle of thorns and thistles. You must smell the trees and shrubs and say O happy this grove is the flower of Paradise. Then you will come to a narrow pass on one side of which there is a wolf bound with chains and on the other side there is a lamb bound with chains. There is a bundle of grass before the wolf and a piece of meat before the lamb. You must put the grass before the lamb and the meat before the wolf. You will then come to a large gate with double doors one open and one closed. You must open the closed door and shut the open one. Entering in you will find the Fairy Queen owner of the Fairy Nightingale sleeping in a splendid bedchamber. She sleeps seven days and nights and is awake seven days and nights. If you can do what I have told you and reach there at a time when the Queen is asleep you can bring the Nightingale if not you are lost.The lad started and came successively to the river the grove the lamb and the wolf and the gate. He did all that the monk had told him and entering in saw an exquisite bedchamber where a maiden as beautiful as the sun was sleeping on a purple bed embroidered with gold and jewelry. The Fairy Nightingale came down from its cage and standing on the Queens bedside sang to her a thousand songs with enchanting melody and lullabied her to sound sleep. The lad who was watching from behind the arras seeing the maiden asleep and that the Nightingale had returned to its cage crept in slowly took the Nightingales cage pressed a kiss upon the forehead of the sleeping maiden thus stamping the sign of his lips there and started back on his way.The Queen awoke and seeing the Nightingale had been stolen exclaimedDoors catch the thiefGod speed him said the doors he closed the open one of us and opened the closed one of us.Wolf and lamb catch the thief exclaimed the Fairy Queen.God speed him said the wolf and the lamb he gave the meat to the wolf and the grass to the lamb.Grove catch the thief exclaimed the Queen.God speed him said the grove you made me thorns and thistles he made me a flower of Paradise.River catch the thief exclaimed the Queen.God speed him said the river you made me a stream of poison he made me the water of immortality.When the Queen saw that all her charms were unavailing she mounted her horse and started in pursuit of the lad.But let us return to the lad. He passed all the dangerous places and came to the square where the road divided into the three branches. He saw the monk waiting for him.Here is the Fairy Nightingale holy father said the lad and seeing that his brothers had not yet come back he give the cage to the monk and he himself started in search of his brothers. He went first along the broad road until he came to the inn where his brother was serving. He secretly made himself known to him and taking him away brought him to the monk. He then took the next road and went as far as the green meadow and sat down upon one of the benches. Soon the giant appeared with his iron rod and tried to strike the lad. But the lad cleverly avoided the blow and snatching the rod from the giants hand struck him. Immediately the giant fell down and was changed into a huge round black stone.My brother must have been lost somewhere in this place thought the lad and began to strike with the iron rod the stones scattered here and there upon the meadow and lo the stones were changed into men who began to run away but his brother was not among them. He saw a stone under the bench and struck it. It was changed into his brother and began to run.Brother brother do not run it is I exclaimed the lad.He stopped and both returned to the monk. All three taking the Fairy Nightingale went toward their fathers city. On the way they were thirsty and came to a well.They lowered the youngest brother to draw water and as soon as he reached the bottom of the well the two older brothers said to one anotherWhen we go home to our father all praise and glory will be given to that fellow who is now in the well and we shall be despised. It shall not be he shall never come up from that well.They cut the rope and leaving the hero in the well took the Nightingale and went to their father sayingOur youngest brother was killed in our attempt to get the Fairy Nightingale but we two succeeded in bringing it.They hung the cage in the new church but the Fairy Nightingale did not warble a single song it was sad and silent. Soon the Fairy Queen came riding to the King and saidWho is the hero that has brought my NightingaleWe brought it said the two brothers.Well what did you meet on the way inquired the Queen.Nothing said the lads.Then it was not you who brought it said the Queen you are thieves. And she caused them to be arrested and cast into prison sayingYou shall not be released until the real hero who brought the Fairy Nightingale is presented to me.Some women who were gleaning barley in the fields happened to pass near the well where the lad was left and hearing him groan took him out one of them who had no children adopted him as her son. After a few weeks news came from the city to the village to the effect that the Kings sons had brought the Fairy Nightingale but the Fairy Queen the owner of the Nightingale also had come after it. One day the lad asked permission of his adopted mother sayingA new church has been built let me go and see it.The old woman consented and he went to the city as a peasant boy. He went to his fathers house and heard that his brothers were imprisoned. He went directly to the prison and set them free. The Fairy Queen hearing this came and said to the ladI am the Fairy Queen the owner of the Nightingale are you not afraid of meI am he who brought the Fairy Nightingale said the lad I am not afraid of you.What did you see on the way asked the Queen.The lad told her what he had seen and what he had done.And moreover said the lad I have put a sign upon your forehead with my own lips. Look at your image in yonder pond and you will see that you are my betrothed.The Queen looked at her reflected image in the water and seeing the mark of the lads kiss exclaimedHero you are worthy of me I am yours hereafter.A wedding festival for forty days and forty nights was celebrated. After this the couple went to the church to be married. The Fairy Nightingale began to warble and sang them a thousand and one songs. It is still singing and all the world is wondering at its sweet melodies.Three apples fell from heaven one for me one for the storyteller and one for him who entertained the company.
Truly the wise man said well that a command of gall cannot be obeyed like one of sugar. A man must require just and reasonable things if he would see the scales of obedience properly trimmed.From orders which are improper springs resistance which is not easily overcome as happened to the King of RoughRock who by asking what he ought not of his daughter caused her to run away from him at the risk of losing both honour and life.There lived it is said once upon a time a King of RoughRock who had a wife the very mother of beauty but in the full career of her years she fell from the horse of health and broke her life. Before the candle of life went out at the auction of her years she called her husband and said to him I know you have always loved me tenderly show me therefore at the close of my days the completion of your love by promising me never to marry again unless you find a woman as beautiful as I have been otherwise I leave you my curse and shall bear you hatred even in the other world.The King who loved his wife beyond measure hearing this her last wish burst into tears and for some time could not answer a single word. At last when he had done weeping he said to her Sooner than take another wife may the gout lay hold of me may I have my head cut off like a mackerel My dearest love drive such a thought from your mind do not believe in dreams or that I could love any other woman you were the first new coat of my love and you shall carry away with you the last rags of my affection.As he said these words the poor young Queen who was at the point of death turned up her eyes and stretched out her feet. When the King saw her life thus running out he unstopped the channels of his eyes and made such a howling and beating and outcry that all the Court came running up calling on the name of the dear soul and upbraiding Fortune for taking her from him and plucking out his beard he cursed the stars that had sent him such a misfortune. But bearing in mind the maxim Pain in ones elbow and pain for ones wife are alike hard to bear but are soon over ere the Night had gone forth into the placeofarms in the sky to muster the bats he began to count upon his fingers and to reflect thus to himself Here is my wife dead and I am left a wretched widower with no hope of seeing any one but this poor daughter whom she has left me. I must therefore try to discover some means or other of having a son and heir. But where shall I look Where shall I find a woman equal in beauty to my wife Every one appears a witch in comparison with her where then shall I find another with a bit of stick or seek another with the bell if Nature made Nardella may she be in glory and then broke the mould Alas in what a labyrinth has she put me in what a perplexity has the promise I made her left me But what do I say I am running away before I have seen the wolf let me open my eyes and ears and look about may there not be some other as beautiful Is it possible that the world should be lost to me Is there such a dearth of women or is the race extinctSo saying he forthwith issued a proclamation and command that all the handsome women in the world should come to the touchstone of beauty for he would take the most beautiful to wife and endow her with a kingdom. Now when this news was spread abroad there was not a woman in the universe who did not come to try her lucknot a witch however ugly who stayed behind for when it is a question of beauty no scullionwench will acknowledge herself surpassed every one piques herself on being the handsomest and if the lookingglass tells her the truth she blames the glass for being untrue and the quicksilver for being put on badly.When the town was thus filled with women the King had them all drawn up in a line and he walked up and down from top to bottom and as he examined and measured each from head to foot one appeared to him wrybrowed another longnosed another broadmouthed another thicklipped another tall as a maypole another short and dumpy another too stout another too slender the Spaniard did not please him on account of her dark colour the Neopolitan was not to his fancy on account of her gait the German appeared cold and icy the Frenchwoman frivolous and giddy the Venetian with her light hair looked like a distaff of flax. At the end of the end one for this cause and another for that he sent them all away with one hand before and the other behind and seeing that so many fair faces were all show and no wool he turned his thoughts to his own daughter saying Why do I go seeking the impossible when my daughter Preziosa is formed in the same mould of beauty as her mother I have this fair face here in my house and yet go looking for it at the fagend of the world. She shall marry whom I will and so I shall have an heir.When Preziosa heard this she retired to her chamber and bewailing her illfortune as if she would not leave a hair upon her head and whilst she was lamenting thus an old woman came to her who was her confidant. As soon as she saw Preziosa who seemed to belong more to the other world than to this and heard the cause of her grief the old woman said to her Cheer up my daughter do not despair there is a remedy for every evil save death. Now listen if your father speaks to you thus once again put this bit of wood into your mouth and instantly you will be changed into a shebear then off with you for in his fright he will let you depart and go straight to the wood where Heaven has kept goodfortune in store for you since the day you were born and whenever you wish to appear a woman as you are and will remain only take the piece of wood out of your mouth and you will return to your true form. Then Preziosa embraced the old woman and giving her a good apronful of meal and ham and bacon sent her away.As soon as the Sun began to change his quarters the King ordered the musicians to come and inviting all his lords and vassals he held a great feast. And after dancing for five or six hours they all sat down to table and ate and drank beyond measure. Then the King asked his courtiers to whom he should marry Preziosa as she was the picture of his dead wife. But the instant Preziosa heard this she slipped the bit of wood into her mouth and took the figure of a terrible shebear at the sight of which all present were frightened out of their wits and ran off as fast as they could scamper.Meanwhile Preziosa went out and took her way to a wood where the Shades were holding a consultation how they might do some mischief to the Sun at the close of day. And there she stayed in the pleasant companionship of the other animals until the son of the King of RunningWater came to hunt in that part of the country who at the sight of the bear had like to have died on the spot. But when he saw the beast come gently up to him wagging her tail like a little dog and rubbing her sides against him he took courage and patted her and said Good bear good bear there there poor beast poor beast Then he led her home and ordered that she should be taken great care of and he had her put into a garden close to the royal palace that he might see her from the window whenever he wished.One day when all the people of the house were gone out and the Prince was left alone he went to the window to look out at the bear and there he beheld Preziosa who had taken the piece of wood out of her mouth combing her golden tresses. At the sight of this beauty which was beyond the beyonds he had like to have lost his senses with amazement and tumbling down the stairs he ran out into the garden. But Preziosa who was on the watch and observed him popped the piece of wood into her mouth and was instantly changed into a bear again.When the Prince came down and looked about in vain for Preziosa whom he had seen from the window above he was so amazed at the trick that a deep melancholy came over him and in four days he fell sick crying continually My bear my bear His mother hearing him wailing thus imagined that the bear had done him some hurt and gave orders that she should be killed. But the servants enamoured of the tameness of the bear who made herself beloved by the very stones in the road took pity on her and instead of killing her they led her to the wood and told the queen that they had put an end to her.When this came to the ears of the Prince he acted in a way to pass belief. Ill or well he jumped out of bed and was going at once to make mincemeat of the servants. But when they told him the truth of the affair he jumped on horseback halfdead as he was and went rambling about and seeking everywhere until at length he found the bear. Then he took her home again and putting her into a chamber said to her O lovely morsel for a King who art shut up in this skin O candle of love who art enclosed within this hairy lanthorn Wherefore all this trifling Do you wish to see me pine and pant and die by inches I am wasting away without hope and tormented by thy beauty. And you see clearly the proof for I am shrunk twothirds in size like wine boiled down and am nothing but skin and bone for the fever is doublestitched to my veins. So lift up the curtain of this hairy hide and let me gaze upon the spectacle of thy beauty Raise O raise the leaves off this basket and let me get a sight of the fine fruit beneath Lift up that curtain and let my eyes pass in to behold the pomp of wonders Who has shut up so smooth a creature in a prison woven of hair Who has locked up so rich a treasure in a leathern chest Let me behold this display of graces and take in payment all my love for nothing else can cure the troubles I endure.But when he had said again and again this and a great deal more and still saw that all his words were thrown away he took to his bed and had such a desperate fit that the doctors prognosticated badly of his case. Then his mother who had no other joy in the world sat down by his bedside and said to him My son whence comes all this grief What melancholy humour has seized you You are young you are loved you are great you are richwhat then is it you want my son Speak a bashful beggar carries an empty bag. If you want a wife only choose and I will bring the match about do you take and Ill pay. Do you not see that your illness is an illness to me Your pulse beats with fever in your veins and my heart beats with illness in my brain for I have no other support of my old age than you. So be cheerful now and cheer up my heart and do not see the whole kingdom thrown into mourning this house into lamentation and your mother forlorn and heartbroken.When the Prince heard these words he said Nothing can console me but the sight of the bear. Therefore if you wish to see me well again let her be brought into this chamber I will have no one else to attend me and make my bed and cook for me but she herself and you may be sure that this pleasure will make me well in a trice.Thereupon his mother although she thought it ridiculous enough for the bear to act as cook and chambermaid and feared that her son was not in his right mind yet in order to gratify him had the bear fetched. And when the bear came up to the Princes bed she raised her paw and felt the patients pulse which made the Queen laugh outright for she thought every moment that the bear would scratch his nose. Then the Prince said My dear bear will you not cook for me and give me my food and wait upon me and the bear nodded her head to show that she accepted the office. Then his mother had some fowls brought and a fire lighted on the hearth in the same chamber and some water set to boil whereupon the bear laying hold on a fowl scalded and plucked it handily and drew it and then stuck one portion of it on the spit and with the other part she made such a delicious hash that the Prince who could not relish even sugar licked his fingers at the taste. And when he had done eating the bear handed him drink with such grace that the Queen was ready to kiss her on the forehead. Thereupon the Prince arose and the bear quickly set about making the bed and running into the garden she gathered a clothful of roses and citronflowers and strewed them over it so that the queen said the bear was worth her weight in gold and that her son had good reason to be fond of her.But when the Prince saw these pretty offices they only added fuel to the fire and if before he wasted by ounces he now melted away by pounds and he said to the Queen My lady mother if I do not give this bear a kiss the breath will leave my body. Whereupon the Queen seeing him fainting away said Kiss him kiss him my beautiful beast Let me not see my poor son die of longing Then the bear went up to the Prince and taking him by the cheeks kissed him again and again. Meanwhile I know not how it was the piece of wood slipped out of Preziosas mouth and she remained in the arms of the Prince the most beautiful creature in the world and pressing her to his heart he said I have caught you my little rogue You shall not escape from me again without a good reason. At these words Preziosa adding the colour of modesty to the picture of her natural beauty said to him I am indeed in your handsonly guard me safely and marry me when you will.Then the Queen inquired who the beautiful maiden was and what had brought her to this savage life and Preziosa related the whole story of her misfortunes at which the Queen praising her as a good and virtuous girl told her son that she was content that Preziosa should be his wife. Then the Prince who desired nothing else in life forthwith pledged her his faith and the mother giving them her blessing this happy marriage was celebrated with great feasting and illuminations and Preziosa experienced the truth of the saying thatOne who acts well may always expect good.
No bird is more common in Korea than the magpie. They are numbered by millions. Every day in the year except the seventh day of the seventh month the air is full of them. On that date however they have a standing engagement every year. They are all expected to be away from streets and houses for every wellbred magpie is then far up in the sky building a bridge across the River of Stars called the Milky Way. With their wings for the cables and their heads to form the floor of the bridge they make a pathway for lovers on either side of the Silver Stream.Boys and girls are usually very kind to the magpies but if a single one be found about the houseson the roofs or in the streets on the seventh of August woe betide it Every dirtyfaced brat throws sticks or stones at the poor creature for not being about its business of bridgebuilding across the Starry River. By evening time the magpies return to their usual places for they are then supposed to have attended to their tasks and built the bridge.To prove beyond a doubt that the bridge was made and walked over you have only to look at the bare heads of the magpies at this time. Their feathers have been entirely worn off by the tramping of the crowd of retainers who follow the Prince of Star Land across the bridge to meet his bride. If it be wet weather on the morning of this day of the Weaver Maiden and the Cattle Prince the raindrops are the tears of joy shed by the lovers at their first meeting. If showers fall in the afternoon they are the tears of sadness at saying farewell when the prince and princess leave each other.If any thunder is heard every boy and girl knows that this comes from the rumble of the wagons which carry the baggage of the prince and princess as they move away each from the other homeward. Now this is the story which the Korean mothers tell to their children of the Bridge of Birds.Long long ago in the Kingdom of the Starsa king reigned who had a lovely daughter. Besides being the most beautiful to behold she was a skillful weaver. There was no good thing to be done in the palace but she could do it. She was not only highly accomplished but of sweet temper and very willing. Being a model of all diligence she was very greatly beloved of her parents and her influence over her father was very great. He would do almost anything to please his darling daughter. In due time a young and very handsome prince who lived in Star Land came to her fathers court and fell in love with the pretty princess. Her parents consenting the wedding was celebrated with great splendor.Now that she was a wife and had a home of her own to care for she became all the more a model of lovely womanhood and an example to all the maidens of Korea forever. Besides showing diligence in the care of clothes and food and in setting her servants a good example of thrift she thought much of their happiness. Her service to her husband was unremitting. Her chief ambition was to make his life one of constant joy. But the prince instead of following his brides good example and of appreciating what his beautiful and unselfish bride was doing for his happiness gave himself up to waste and extravagance.He became lazy and dissipated. Neglecting his duties he wasted his own fortune and his wifes dowry. He sold all his oxen and calves to get money only to lose it in gambling. He borrowed many and long ropes of coin from any one who would lend him the brass and iron money. Finally he was so scandalously poor being on his last string of cash that he was in danger of being degraded from his rank as prince and of having his name spoken with contempt.The King of the Stars having seen his soninlaw on the downward way had more than once threatened to disinherit or banish him especially after the prince had parted with his cattle. Yet when his daughter the young wife interceded and begged pardon for her husband the king relentedpaid his soninlaws debts and gave him another chance to do better.When however the worthless fellow fell back into his old ways and grewworse and worse the king resolved to separate the pair one from the other. He banished the prince far far away six months distance from the northside of the River of Heaven and exiled the princess a half years measure of space from the south side of the Starry Stream.Although the king in his wrath had hardened his heart even against his own beloved child and had driven her from court and palace because ofher worthless husband yet as a signal proof of his compassion he ordained that on one night of the year on the seventh night of the seventh moon they might meet for a few hours.The lovely lady that stands by the starry river to meet her lord. Illustration by unknown artist published in Korean Fairy Tales by William Eliot Griffis 1922 Thomas Y. Crowell and Company.The young people parted and took their sad journey to the edge of the starry heavens but they loved each other so dearly that as soon as they arrived at their place of banishment they turned round to meet each other on August 7th. So when the day came after six months wearyjourneying they had reached the edge of the Starry River and there they stood catching glimpses and waving their hands but unable to getcloser to each other. There one may see them on summer nights shining on opposite sides of the broad Stream of Stars loving each other but unable to cross.Feeling that the great gulf of space could not be spanned the loving couple burst into tears. The flood from their eyes making the river overflow deluged the earth below threatening to float everything houses people animals away. What could be done The fourfooted creatures fish and fowls held a convention but it was agreed that only those birds with strong wings and able to fly high could do anything. So the magpies with many flattering speeches were commended to the enterprise.When these noisy and chattering creatures that are nevertheless so kind and friendly to the sparrows heard of the lovers troubles aloft they resolved to help the sorrowing pair over the River of Stars. Out of their big ugly nests they flew gladly to the convention that voted to build the bridge. Sending out word all over the world millions of magpies assembled in the air. Under the direction of their wisest chiefs they began their work of making with a mass of wings a flying bridge that would reach from shore to shore of the Starry Stream.First they put their heads together to furnish a floor and so closely that the bridge looked as if it were paved with white granite. Then with their pinions they held up the great arch and highway over which the prince crossed to his bride with all his baggage and train of followers. The tables were soon spread and the two royal lovers enjoyed a feast with many tender words and caresses.Every year for ages past on the seventh day of the seventh month the magpies have done this. Indeed although the star lovers meet only once a year yet as they live on forever the wife has her husband and the husband his wife much longer than mortal couples who live on earth. It is lawin the magpie kingdom that no bird can shirk this work. Any magpie that tries to get out of the task and that is too bad or lazy to do its part in bridgebuilding is chased away by the Korean children who want no such truant around. For does not every girl hope to be as diligent and accomplishedas the Star Princess so that when she grows up she may make as good a wife as the lovely lady that every year stands by the Starry River tomeet her lord As for the boys it is hoped that they will become as faithful husbands as the penitent bridegroom who every year on the night of August 7th awaits his bride on the shining shore of the River of Stars.
A Prophet sat in the marketplace and told the fortunes of all who cared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken into by thieves and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a moment and rushed off tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused and one of them said Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others but it seems hes not clever enough to perceive whats in store for himself.
Once upon a time a lot of fairies lived in Mona.One day the queen fairys daughter who was now fifteen years of age told her mother she wished to go out and see the world.The queen consented allowing her to go for a day and to change from a fairy to a bird or from a bird to a fairy as she wished.When she returned one night she saidIve been to a gentlemans house and as I stood listening I heard the gentleman was witched he was very ill and crying out with pain.Oh I must look into that said the queen.So the next day she went through her process and found that he was bewitched by an old witch. So the following day she set out with six other fairies and when they came to the gentlemans house she found he was very ill.Going into the room bearing a small blue pot they had brought with them the queen asked himWould you like to be curedOh bless you yes indeed.Whereupon the queen put the little blue pot of perfume on the centre of the table and lit it when the room was instantly filled with the most delicious odour.Whilst the perfume was burning the six fairies formed in line behind her and she leading they walked round the table three times chanting in chorus  Round and round three times threeWe have come to cure thee.At the end of the third round she touched the burning perfume with her wand and then touched the gentleman on the head sayingBe thou made whole.No sooner had she said the words than he jumped up hale and hearty and saidOh dear queen what shall I do for you Ill do anything you wish.Money I do not wish for said the queen but theres a little plot of ground on the seacliff I want you to lend me for I wish to make a ring there and the grass will die when I make the ring. Then I want you to build three walls round the ring but leave the seaside open so that we may be able to come and go easily.With the greatest of pleasure said the gentleman and he built the three stone walls at once at the spot indicated.Near the gentleman lived the old witch and she had the power of turning at will into a hare. The gentleman was a great hare hunter but the hounds could never catch this hare it always disappeared in a mill running between the wings and jumping in at an open window though they stationed two men and a dog at the spot when it immediately turned into the old witch. And the old miller never suspected for the old woman used to take him a peck of corn to grind a few days before any hunt telling him she would call for it on the afternoon of the day of the hunt. So that when she arrived she was expected.One day she had been taunting the gentleman as he returned from a hunt that he could never catch the hare and he struck her with his whip saying Get away you witchcraftWhereupon she witched him and he fell ill and was cured as we have seen.When he got well he watched the old witch and saw she often visited the house of an old miser who lived near by with his beautiful niece. Now all the people in the village touched their hats most respectfully to this old miser for they knew he had dealings with the witch and they were as much afraid of him as of her but everyone loved the misers kind and beautiful niece.When the fairies got home the queen told her daughterI have no power over the old witch for twelve months from today and then I have no power over her life. She must lose that by the arm of a man.So the next day the daughter was sent out again to see whether she could find a person suited to that purpose.In the village lived a small crofter who was afraid of nothing he was the boldest man thereabouts and one day he passed the miser without saluting him. The old fellow went off at once and told the witch.Oh Ill settle his cows tonight said she and they were taken sick and gave no milk that night.The fairys daughter arrived at his croftyard after the cows were taken ill and she heard him say to his son a bright ladIt must be the old witchWhen she heard this she sent him to the queen.So next day the fairy queen took six fairies and went to the croft taking her blue pot of perfume. When she got there she asked the crofter if he would like his cows curedGod bless you yes he said.The queen made him bring a round table into the yard whereon she placed the blue pot of perfume and having lit it as before they formed in line and walked round thrice chanting the words  Round and round three times threeWe have come to cure thee.Then she dipped the end of her wand into the perfume and touched the cows on the forehead saying to each oneBe thou whole.Whereupon they jumped up cured.The little farmer was overjoyed and criedOh what can I do for you What can I do for youMoney I care not for said the queen all I want is your son to avenge you and me.The lad jumped up and saidWhat I can do Ill do it for you my lady fairy.She told him to be at the walled plot the following day at noon and left.The next day at noon the queen and her daughter and three hundred other fairies came up the cliff to the green grass plot and they carried a pole and a tape and a mirror. When they reached the plot they planted the pole in the ground and hung the mirror on the pole. The queen took the tape which measured ten yards and was fastened to the top of the pole and walked round in a circle and wherever she set her feet the grass withered and died. Then the fairies followed up behind the queen and each fairy carried a harebell in her lefthand and a little blue cup of burning perfume in her right. When they had formed up the queen called the lad to her side and told him to walk by her throughout. They then started off all singing in chorus  Round and round three times threeTell me what you see.When they finished the first round the queen and lad stopped before the mirror and she asked the lad what he saw  I see I see the mirror tells meIt is the witch that I seesaid the lad. So they marched round again singing the same words as before and when they stopped a second time before the mirror the queen again asked him what he saw  I see I see the mirror tells meIt is a hare that I seesaid the lad.A third time the ceremony and question were repeated.  I see I see the mirror tells meThe hares run up the hill to the mill.Now said the queen there is to be a harehunting this day week be at the mill at noon and I will meet you there.And then the fairies pole mirror and all vanished and only the empty ring on the green was left.Upon the appointed day the lad went to his tryst and at noon the Fairy Queen appeared and gave him a sling and a smooth pebble from the beach sayingI have blessed your arms and I have blessed the sling and the stone.  Now as the clock strikes threeGo up the hill near the millAnd in the ring stand stillTill you hear the click of the mill.Then with thy arm with power and mightYou shall strike and smiteThe devil of a witch called Jezabel lightAnd you shall see an awful sight.The lad did as he was bidden and presently he heard the huntsmans horn and the hue and cry and saw the hare running down the opposite hillside where the hounds seemed to gain on her but as she breasted the hill on which he stood she gained on them. As she came towards the mill he threw his stone and it lodged in her skull and when he ran up he found he had killed the old witch. As the huntsmen came up they crowded round him and praised him and then they fastened the witchs body to a horse by ropes and dragged her to the bottom of the valley where they buried her in a ditch. That night when the miser heard of her death he dropped down dead on the spot.As the lad was going home the queen appeared to him and told him to be at the ring the following day at noon.Next day all the fairies came with the pole and mirror each carrying a harebell in her lefthand and a blue cup of burning perfume in her right and they formed up as before the lad walking beside the queen. They marched round and repeated the old words when the queen stopped before the mirror and saidWhat do you see  I see I see the mirror tells meIt is an old platecupboard that I see.A second time they went round and the question was repeated.  I see I see the mirror tells meThe back is turned to me.A third time was the ceremony fulfilled and the lad answered  I see I see the mirror tells meA springdoor is open to me.Buy that platecupboard at the misers sale said the queen and she and her companions disappeared as before.Upon the day of the sale all the things were brought out in the road and the platecupboard was put up the lad recognising it and bidding up for it till it was sold to him. When he had paid for it he took it home in a cart and when he got in and examined it he found the secret drawer behind was full of gold. The following week the house and land thirty acres was put up for sale and the lad bought both and married the misers niece and they lived happily till they died.
Once upon a time there were Three Bears who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. One of them was a Little Small Wee Bear and one was a Middlesized Bear and the other was a Great Huge Bear. They had each a pot for their porridge a little pot for the Little Small Wee Bear and a middlesized pot for the Middle Bear and a great pot for the Great Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in a little chair for the Little Small Wee Bear and a middlesized chair for the Middle Bear and a great chair for the Great Huge Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in a little bed for the Little Small Wee Bear and a middlesized bed for the Middle Bear and a great bed for the Great Huge Bear.You can listen to The Three Bears in audio plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devicesOne day after they had made the porridge for their breakfast and poured it into their porridgepots they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking a little old Woman came to the house. She could not have been a good honest old Woman for first she looked in at the window and then she peeped in at the keyhole and seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened because the Bears were good Bears who did nobody any harm and never suspected that anybody would harm them. So the little old Woman opened the door and went in and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had been a good little old Woman she would have waited till the Bears came home and then perhaps they would have asked her to breakfast for they were good Bearsa little rough or so as the manner of Bears is but for all that very goodnatured and hospitable. But she was an impudent bad old Woman and set about helping herself.So first she tasted the porridge of the Great Huge Bear and that was too hot for her and she said a bad word about that. And then she tasted the porridge of the Middle Bear and that was too cold for her and she said a bad word about that too. And then she went to the porridge of the Little Small Wee Bear and tasted that and that was neither too hot nor too cold but just right and she liked it so well that she ate it all up but the naughty old Woman said a bad word about the little porridgepot because it did not hold enough for her.Then the little old Woman sate down in the chair of the Great Huge Bear and that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle Bear and that was too soft for her. And then she sate down in the chair of the Little Small Wee Bear and that was neither too hard nor too soft but just right. So she seated herself in it and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out and down she came plump upon the ground. And the naughty old Woman said a wicked word about that too.Then the little old Woman went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great Huge Bear but that was too high at the head for her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little Small Wee Bear and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably and lay there till she fell fast asleep.By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough so they came home to breakfast. Now the little old Woman had left the spoon of the Great Huge Bear standing in his porridge.Somebody has been at my porridgesaid the Great Huge Bear in his great rough gruff voice. And when the Middle Bear looked at his he saw that the spoon was standing in it too. They were wooden spoons if they had been silver ones the naughty old Woman would have put them in her pocket.Somebody has been at my porridgesaid the Middle Bear in his middle voice.Then the Little Small Wee Bear looked at his and there was the spoon in the porridgepot but the porridge was all gone.Somebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all upsaid the Little Small Wee Bear in his little small wee voice.Upon this the Three Bears seeing that some one had entered their house and eaten up the Little Small Wee Bears breakfast began to look about them. Now the little old Woman had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great Huge Bear.Somebody has been sitting in my chairsaid the Great Huge Bear in his great rough gruff voice.And the little old Woman had squatted down the soft cushion of theMiddle Bear.Somebody has been sitting in my chairsaid the Middle Bear in his middle voice.And you know what the little old Woman had done to the third chair.Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of itsaid the Little Small Wee Bear in his little small wee voice.Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make farther search so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now the little old Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great Huge Bear out of its place.Somebody has been lying in my bedsaid the Great Huge Bear in his great rough gruff voice.And the little old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out of its place.Somebody has been lying in my bedsaid the Middle Bear in his middle voice.And when the Little Small Wee Bear came to look at his bed there was the bolster in its place and the pillow in its place upon the bolster and upon the pillow was the little old Womans ugly dirty headwhich was not in its place for she had no business there.Somebody has been lying in my bedand here she issaid the Little Small Wee Bear in his little small wee voice.The little old Woman had heard in her sleep the great rough gruff voice of the Great Huge Bear but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the middle voice of the Middle Bear but it was only as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little small wee voice of the Little Small Wee Bear it was so sharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once.Up she started and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other and ran to the window. Now the window was open because the Bears like good tidy Bears as they were always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. Out the little old Woman jumped and whether she broke her neck in the fall or ran into the wood and was lost there or found her way out of the wood and was taken up by the constable and sent to the House of Correction for a vagrant as she was I cannot tell. But the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.
Young man Ill give thee five dollars a week to be caretaker in PrintzHall said Quaker Quidd to fiddler Matthews on an autumn evening.Young Matthews had just been taunting the old gentleman with being afraid to sleep on his own domain and as the eyes of all the tavern loungers were on him he could hardly decline so flattering a proposition so after some hemming and hawing he said he would take the Quaker at his word. He played but two or three more tunes that evening did Peter Matthews and played them rather sadly then as Quidd had finished his mulled cider and departed he took his homeward way in thoughtful mood. Printz Hall stood in a lonely weedgrown garden near Chester Pennsylvania and thither repaired Peter as next days twilight shut down with a mattress blanket comestibles his beloved fiddle and a flask of whiskey. Ensconcing himself in the room that was least depressing in appearance he stuffed rags into the vacant panes lighted a candle started a blaze in the fireplace and ate his supper.Not so bad a place after all mumbled Peter as he warmed himself at the fire and the flask then taking out his violin he began to play. The echo of his music emphasized the emptiness of the house the damp got into the strings so that they sounded tubby and there were unintentional quavers in the melody whenever the trees swung against the windows and splashed them with rain or when a distant shutter fell acreaking. Finally he stirred the fire bolted the door snuffed his candle took a courageous pull at the liquor flung off his coat and shoes rolled his blanket around him stretched himself on the mattress and fell asleep. He was awakened bywell he could not say what exactly only he became suddenly as wide awake as ever he had been in his life and listened for some sound that he knew was going to come out of the roar of the wind and the slamming grating and whistling about the house. Yes there it was a tread and a clank on the stair. The door so tightly bolted flew open and there entered a dark figure with steeplecrowned hat cloak jackboots sword and corselet. The terrified fiddler wanted to howl but his voice was gone. I am Peter Printz governorgeneral of his Swedish Majestys American colonies and builder of this house said the figure. Tis the night of the autumnal equinox when my friends meet here for revel. Take thy fiddle and come. Play but speak not.And whether he wished or no Peter was drawn to follow the figure which he could make out by the phosphor gleam of it. Downstairs they went doors swinging open before them and along corridors that clanged to the stroke of the spectres boot heels. Now they came to the ancient receptionroom and as they entered it Peter was dazzled. The floor was smooth with wax logs snapped in the fireplace though the flame was somewhat blue the old hangings and portraits looked fresh and in the light of wax candles a hundred people in the brave array of old times walked courtesied and seemed to laugh and talk together. As the fiddler appeared every eye was turned on him in a disquieting way and when he addressed himself to his bottle from every throat came a hollow laugh. Finding his way to a chair he sank into it and put his instrument in position. At the first note the couples took hands and as he struck into a jig they began to circle swiftly leaping wondrous high.Faster went the music for the whiskey was at work in Peters noddle and wilder grew the dance. It was as if the storm had come in through the windows and was blowing these people hither and yon around and around. The fiddler vaguely wondered at himself for he had never played so well though he had never heard the tune before. Now loomed Governor Printz in the middle of the room and extending his hand he ordered the dance to cease. Thou bast played well fiddler he said and shalt be paid. Then at his signal came two negro men tugging at a strong box that Printz unlocked. It was filled with gold pieces. Hold thy fiddle bag commanded the governor and Peter did so watching open mouthed the transfer of a double handful of treasure from box to sack. Another such handful followed and another. At the fourth Peter could no longer contain himself. He forgot the injunction not to speak and shouted gleefully Lord Harry Heres luckThere was a shriek of demon laughter the scene was lost in darkness and Peter fell insensible. In the morning a tavernhaunting friend anxious to know if Peter had met with any adventure entered the house and went cautiously from room to room calling on the watcher to show himself. There was no response. At last he stumbled on the whiskey bottle empty and knew that Peter must be near. Sure enough there he lay in the great room with dust and mould thick on everything and his fiddle smashed into a thousand pieces. Peter on being awakened looked ruefully about him then sprang up and eagerly demanded his money. What money asked his friend. The fiddler clutched at his green bag opened it shook it there was nothing. Nor was there any delay in Peters exit from that mansion and when twentyfour hours after the house went up in flames he averred that the ghosts had set it afire and that he knew where they brought their coals from.
There was once a woman named Katcha who lived in a village where she owned her own cottage and garden. She had money besides but little good it did her because she was such an illtempered vixen that nobody not even the poorest laborer would marry her. Nobody would even work for her no matter what she paid for she couldnt open her mouth without scolding and whenever she scolded she raised her shrill voice until you could hear it a mile away. The older she grew the worse she became until by the time she was forty she was as sour as vinegar.Now as it always happens in a village every Sunday afternoon there was a dance either at the burgomasters or at the tavern. As soon as the bagpipes sounded the boys all crowded into the room and the girls gathered outside and looked in the windows. Katcha was always the first at the window. The music would strike up and the boys would beckon the girls to come in and dance but no one ever beckoned Katcha. Even when she paid the piper no one ever asked her to dance. Yet she came Sunday after Sunday just the same.One Sunday afternoon as she was hurrying to the tavern she thought to herself Here I am getting old and yet Ive never once danced with a boy Plague take it today Id dance with the devil if he asked meShe was in a fine rage by the time she reached the tavern where she sat down near the stove and looked around to see what girls the boys had invited to dance.Suddenly a stranger in hunters green came in. He sat down at a table near Katcha and ordered drink. When the serving maid brought the beer he reached over to Katcha and asked her to drink with him. At first she was much taken back at this attention then she pursed her lips coyly and pretended to refuse but finally she accepted.When they had finished drinking he pulled a ducat from his pocket tossed it to the piper and called outClear the floor boys This is for Katcha and me aloneThe boys snickered and the girls giggled hiding behind each other and stuffing their aprons into their mouths so that Katcha wouldnt hear them laughing. But Katcha wasnt noticing them at all. Katcha was dancing with a fine young man If the whole world had been laughing at her Katcha wouldnt have cared.The stranger danced with Katcha all afternoon and all evening. Not once did he dance with any one else. He bought her marzipan and sweet drinks and when the hour came to go home he escorted her through the village.Ah sighed Katcha when they reached her cottage and it was time to part I wish I could dance with you foreverVery well said the stranger. Come with me.Where do you livePut your arm around my neck and Ill tell you.Katcha put both arms about his neck and instantly the man changed into a devil and flew straight down to hell.At the gates of hell he stopped and knocked.His comrades came and opened the gates and when they saw that he was exhausted they tried to take Katcha off his neck. But Katcha held on tight and nothing they could do or say would make her budge.The devil finally had to appear before the Prince of Darkness himself with Katcha still glued to his neck.Whats that thing youve got around your neck the Prince asked.So the devil told how as he was walking about on earth he had heard Katcha say she would dance with the devil himself if he asked her. So I asked her to dance with me the devil said. Afterwards just to frighten her a little I brought her down to hell. And now she wont let go of meServe you right you dunce the Prince said. How often have I told you to use common sense when you go wandering around on earth You might have known Katcha would never let go of a man once she had himI beg your Majesty to make her let go the poor devil implored.I will not said the Prince. Youll have to carry her back to earth yourself and get rid of her as best you can. Perhaps this will be a lesson to you.So the devil very tired and very cross shambled back to earth with Katcha still clinging to his neck. He tried every way to get her off. He promised her wooded hills and rich meadows if she but let him go. He cajoled her he cursed her but all to no avail. Katcha still held on.Breathless and discouraged he came at last to a meadow where a shepherd wrapped in a great shaggy sheepskin coat was tending his flocks. The devil transformed himself into an ordinary looking man so that the shepherd didnt recognize him.Hi there the shepherd said whats that youre carryingDont ask me the devil said with a sigh. Im so worn out Im nearly dead. I was walking yonder not thinking of anything at all when along comes a woman and jumps on my back and wont let go. Im trying to carry her to the nearest village to get rid of her there but I dont believe Im able. My legs are giving out.The shepherd who was a goodnatured chap said I tell you what Ill help you. I cant leave my sheep long but Ill carry her halfway.Oh said the devil Id be very grateful if you didSo the shepherd yelled at Katcha Hi there you Catch hold of meWhen Katcha saw that the shepherd was a handsome youth she let go of the devil and leapt upon the shepherds back catching hold of the collar of his sheepskin coat.Now the young shepherd soon found that the long shaggy coat and Katcha made a pretty heavy load for walking. In a few moments he was sick of his bargain and began casting about for some way of getting rid of Katcha.Presently he came to a pond and he thought to himself that hed like to throw her in. He wondered how he could do it. Perhaps he could manage it by throwing in his greatcoat with her. The coat was so loose that he thought he could slip out of it without Katchas discovering what he was doing. Very cautiously he slipped out one arm. Katcha didnt move. He slipped out the other arm. Still Katcha didnt move. He unlooped the first button. Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the second button. Still Katcha noticed nothing. He unlooped the third button and kerplunk he had pitched coat and Katcha and all into the middle of the pondWhen he got back to his sheep the devil looked at him in amazement.Wheres Katcha he gasped.Oh the shepherd said pointing over his shoulder with his thumb I decided to leave her up yonder in a pond.My dear friend the devil cried I thank you You have done me a great favor. If it hadnt been for you I might be carrying Katcha till doomsday. Ill never forget you and some time Ill reward you. As you dont know who it is youve helped I must tell you Im a devil.With these words the devil vanished.For a moment the shepherd was dazed. Then he laughed and said to himself Well if theyre all as stupid as he is we ought to be able for themThe country where the shepherd lived was ruled over by a dissolute young duke who passed his days in riotous living and his nights in carousing. He gave over the affairs of state to two governors who were as bad as he. With extortionate taxes and unjust fines they robbed the people until the whole land was crying out against them.Now one day for amusement the duke summoned an astrologer to court and ordered him to read in the planets the fate of himself and his two governors. When the astrologer had cast a horoscope for each of the three reprobates he was greatly disturbed and tried to dissuade the duke from questioning him further.Such danger he said threatens your life and the lives of your two governors that I fear to speak.Whatever it is said the duke speak. But I warn you to speak the truth for if what you say does not come to pass you will forfeit your life.The astrologer bowed and said Hear then oh Duke what the planets foretell Before the second quarter of the moon on such and such a day at such and such an hour a devil will come and carry off the two governors. At the full of the moon on such and such a day at such and such an hour the same devil will come for your Highness and carry you off to hell.The duke pretended to be unconcerned but in his heart he was deeply shaken. The voice of the astrologer sounded to him like the voice of judgment and for the first time conscience began to trouble him.As for the governors they couldnt eat a bite of food and were carried from the palace half dead with fright. They piled their illgotten wealth into wagons and rode away to their castles where they barred all the doors and windows in order to keep the devil out.The duke reformed. He gave up his evil ways and corrected the abuses of state in the hope of averting if possible his cruel fate.The poor shepherd had no inkling of any of these things. He tended his flocks from day to day and never bothered his head about the happenings in the great world.Suddenly one day the devil appeared before him and said I have come my friend to repay you for your kindness. When the moon is in its first quarter I was to carry off the former governors of this land because they robbed the poor and gave the duke evil counsel. However theyre behaving themselves now so theyre to be given another chance. But they dont know this. Now on such and such a day do you go to the first castle where a crowd of people will be assembled. When a cry goes up and the gates open and I come dragging out the governor do you step up to me and say What do you mean by this Get out of here or therell be trouble Ill pretend to be greatly frightened and make off. Then ask the governor to pay you two bags of gold and if he haggles just threaten to call me back. After that go on to the castle of the second governor and do the same thing and demand the same pay. I warn you though be prudent with the money and use it only for good. When the moon is full Im to carry off the duke himself for he was so wicked that hes to have no second chance. So dont try to save him for if you do youll pay for it with your own skin. Dont forgetThe shepherd remembered carefully everything the devil told him. When the moon was in its first quarter he went to the first castle. A great crowd of people was gathered outside waiting to see the devil carry away the governor.Suddenly there was a loud cry of despair the gates of the castle opened and there was the devil as black as night dragging out the governor. He poor man was half dead with fright.The shepherd elbowed his way through the crowd took the governor by the hand and pushed the devil roughly aside.What do you mean by this he shouted. Get out of here or therell be troubleInstantly the devil fled and the governor fell on his knees before the shepherd and kissed his hands and begged him to state what he wanted in reward. When the shepherd asked for two bags of gold the governor ordered that they be given him without delay.Then the shepherd went to the castle of the second governor and went through exactly the same performance.It goes without saying that the duke soon heard of the shepherd for he had been anxiously awaiting the fate of the two governors. At once he sent a wagon with four horses to fetch the shepherd to the palace and when the shepherd arrived he begged him piteously to rescue him likewise from the devils clutches.Master the shepherd answered I cannot promise you anything. I have to consider my own safety. You have been a great sinner but if you really want to reform if you really want to rule your people justly and kindly and wisely as becomes a true ruler then indeed I will help you even if I have to suffer hellfire in your place.The duke declared that with Gods help he would mend his ways and the shepherd promised to come back on the fatal day.With grief and dread the whole country awaited the coming of the full moon. In the first place the people had greeted the astrologers prophecy with joy but since the duke had reformed their feelings for him had changed.Time sped fast as time does whether joy be coming or sorrow and all too soon the fatal day arrived.Dressed in black and pale with fright the duke sat expecting the arrival of the devil.Suddenly the door flew open and the devil black as night stood before him. He paused a moment and then he said politelyYour time has come Lord Duke and I am here to get youWithout a word the duke arose and followed the devil to the courtyard which was filled with a great multitude of people.At that moment the shepherd all out of breath came pushing his way through the crowd and ran straight at the devil shouting outWhat do you mean by this Get out of here or therell be troubleWhat do you mean whispered the devil. Dont you remember what I told youHush the shepherd whispered back. I dont care anything about the duke. This is to warn you You know Katcha Shes alive and shes looking for youThe instant the devil heard the name of Katcha he turned and fled.All the people cheered the shepherd while the shepherd himself laughed in his sleeve to think that he had taken in the devil so easily.As for the duke he was so grateful to the shepherd that he made him his chief counselor and loved him as a brother. And well he might for the shepherd was a sensible man and always gave him sound advice.
In the woods stood a cottage. In it lived a man and his wife but they had no children. Well they went on a pilgrimage to beseech God to give them a child. God gave them a daughter. She grew and prospered. The prince about that time rode up to the place as he was out hunting and sent his attendant saying Be so good as to go and ask for a draught of water at yon cottage. The attendant went to ask for the water just when the child was weeping and pearls were rolling down from her eyes. Her mother pacified her she began to smile all manner of flowers bloomed. The servant went out and said Prince I have seen a little girl when she weeps pearls roll down and when she smiles all manner of flowers bloom. The prince went into the cottage and began to tease the child to make her cry. She cried and pearls rolled down. He then begged her mother to pacify her. When she smiled the prince saw that all manner of flowers bloomed.The girl continued to grow and the prince always rode round that way when he went hunting. Well she grew up. The prince said Old man give me your daughter to wife. She now embroidered handkerchiefs with eagles. But the emperor said Where are your wits gone to my son that you want to take a peasant girl to wife Then the prince took one of the handkerchiefs that she had embroidered and carried it to the emperor whereat the emperor clapped his hands. Marry said he my son marry Then he conducted her homeward but in his suite was an old woman who had her daughter with her. Well as they were on their way the prince stopped to shoot something and the old woman took everything from the damsel scooped out her eyes and thrust her into a cavern in the ground and dressed her daughter in her apparel so the prince took her to wife without recognising her.But round the cavern there grew a multitude of bushes. An old man came to gather brushwood. The girl the damsel was sitting in the cavern and in front of her a heap of pearls which she had wept as she sat but she had no eyes. Take me said she kind old man and pick up this jewellery here. Well the old man took her collected the jewellery and led her home. At the old mans there were no children but there was an old woman. She the damsel said Collect the jewellery in a bag and carry it to the town for sale and if a certain old woman meets you then dont sell to her but say Give what you have about you. Well he carried it to the town and met the old woman. The old woman said Sell me the jewellery Purchase. How much for it Give what you have about you She gave him an eye. Then the damsel began with one eye to embroider a handkerchief. Again the old man carried jewellery to the town. The old woman again said Old man sell me the jewellery Purchase. How much for it Give what you have about you She gave him the other eye. The damsel then began to embroider still more beautifully. The old man said Theres a dinner at the emperors. The damsel said to him Go kind old man to the dinner and take a jug that you may beg some soup for me. She also tied a handkerchief of her own sewing on the old mans neck. When the prince espied the handkerchief on the old mans neck he cried Whence come you old man From the farm yonder prince and there is also a damsel living at my house so be so kind as to give her something in this jug. But old man where did you get that handkerchief I found a damsel in a cavern in the ground and she embroidered it. The prince at once recognised it by the embroidery. Tis she tis she But the old womans daughter he packed off to tend swine. Thats all.
One day Aponibolinayen and her sisterinlaw went out to gather greens. They walked to the woods to the place where the siksiklat grew for the tender leaves of this vine are very good to eat. Suddenly while searching about in the underbrush Aponibolinayen cried out with joy for she had found the vine and she started to pick the leaves. Pull as hard as she would however the leaves did not come loose and all at once the vine wound itself around her body and began carrying her upward.Far up through the air she went until she reached the sky and there the vine set her down under a tree. Aponibolinayen was so surprised to find herself in the sky that for some time she just sat and looked around and then hearing a rooster crow she arose to see if she could find it. Not far from where she had sat was a beautiful spring surrounded by tall betelnut trees whose tops were pure gold. Rare beads were the sands of the spring and the place where the women set their jars when they came to dip water was a large golden plate. As Aponibolinayen stood admiring the beauties of this spring she beheld a small house nearby and she was filled with fear lest the owner should find her there. She looked about for some means of escape and finally climbed to the top of a betelnut tree and hid.Now the owner of this house was Iniinit the Sun but he was never at home in the daylight for it was his duty to shine in the sky and give light to all the world. At the close of the day when the Big Star took his place in the sky to shine through the night Iniinit returned to his house but early the next morning he was always off again.From her place in the top of the betelnut tree Aponibolinayen saw the Sun when he came home at evening time and again the next morning she saw him leave. When she was sure that he was out of sight she climbed down and entered his dwelling for she was very hungry. She cooked rice and into a pot of boiling water she dropped a stick which immediately became fish so that she had all she wished to eat. When she was no longer hungry she lay down on the bed to sleep.Now late in the afternoon Iniinit returned from his work and went to fish in the river near his house and he caught a big fish. While he sat on the bank cleaning his catch he happened to look up toward his house and was startled to see that it appeared to be on fire.He hurried home but when he reached the house he saw that it was not burning at all and he entered. On his bed he beheld what looked like a flame of fire but upon going closer he found that it was a beautiful woman fast asleep.Iniinit stood for some time wondering what he should do and then he decided to cook some food and invite this lovely creature to eat with him. He put rice over the fire to boil and cut into pieces the fish he had caught. The noise of this awakened Aponibolinayen and she slipped out of the house and back to the top of the betelnut tree. The Sun did not see her leave and when the food was prepared he called her but the bed was empty and he had to eat alone. That night Iniinit could not sleep well for all the time he wondered who the beautiful woman could be. The next morning however he rose as usual and set forth to shine in the sky for that was his work.That day Aponibolinayen stole again to the house of the Sun and cooked food and when she returned to the betelnut tree she left rice and fish ready for the Sun when he came home. Late in the afternoon Iniinit went into his home and when he found pots of hot rice and fish over the fire he was greatly troubled. After he had eaten he walked a long time in the fresh air. Perhaps it is done by the lovely woman who looks like a flame of fire he said. If she comes again I will try to catch her.The next day the Sun shone in the sky as before and when the afternoon grew late he called to the Big Star to hurry to take his place for he was impatient to reach home. As he drew near the house he saw that it again looked as if it was on fire. He crept quietly up the ladder and when he had reached the top he sprang in and shut the door behind him.Aponibolinayen who was cooking rice over the fire was surprised and angry that she had been caught but the Sun gave her betelnut which was covered with gold and they chewed together and told each other their names. Then Aponibolinayen took up the rice and fish and as they ate they talked together and became acquainted.After some time Aponibolinayen and the Sun were married and every morning the Sun went to shine in the sky and upon his return at night he found his supper ready for him. He began to be troubled however to know where the food came from for though he brought home a fine fish every night Aponibolinayen always refused to cook it.One night he watched her prepare their meal and he saw that instead of using the nice fish he had brought she only dropped a stick into the pot of boiling water.Why do you try to cook a stick asked Iniinit in surprise.So that we can have fish to eat answered his wife.If you cook that stick for a month it will not be soft said Iniinit. Take this fish that I caught in the net for it will be good.But Aponibolinayen only laughed at him and when they were ready to eat she took the cover off the pot and there was plenty of nice soft fish. The next night and the next Aponibolinayen cooked the stick and Iniinit became greatly troubled for he saw that though the stick always supplied them with fish it never grew smaller.Finally he asked Aponibolinayen again why it was that she cooked the stick instead of the fish he brought and she saidDo you not know of the woman on earth who has magical power and can change thingsYes answered the Sun and now I know that you have great power.Well then said his wife do not ask again why I cook the stick.And they ate their supper of rice and the fish which the stick made.One night not long after this Aponibolinayen told her husband that she wanted to go with him the next day when he made light in the sky.Oh no you cannot said the Sun for it is very hot up there and you cannot stand the heat.We will take many blankets and pillows said the woman and when the heat becomes very great I will hide under them.Again and again Iniinit begged her not to go but as often she insisted on accompanying him and early in the morning they set out carrying with them many blankets and pillows.First they went to the East and as soon as they arrived the Sun began to shine and Aponibolinayen was with him. They traveled toward the West but when morning had passed into noontime and they had reached the middle of the sky Aponibolinayen was so hot that she melted and became oil. Then Iniinit put her into a bottle and wrapped her in the blankets and pillows and dropped her down to earth.Now one of the women of Aponibolinayens town was at the spring dipping water when she heard something fall near her. Turning to look she beheld a bundle of beautiful blankets and pillows which she began to unroll and inside she found the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. Frightened at her discovery the woman ran as fast as she could to the town where she called the people together and told them to come at once to the spring. They all hastened to the spot and there they found Aponibolinayen for whom they had been searching everywhere.Where have you been asked her father we have searched all over the world and we could not find you.I have come from Pindayan answered Aponibolinayen. Enemies of our people kept me there till I made my escape while they were asleep at nightAll were filled with joy that the lost one had returned and they decided that at the next moon they would perform a ceremony for the spirits and invite all the relatives who were mourning for Aponibolinayen.So they began to prepare for the ceremony and while they were pounding rice Aponibolinayen asked her mother to prick her little finger where it itched and as she did so a beautiful baby boy popped out. The people were very much surprised at this and they noticed that every time he was bathed the baby grew very fast so that in a short time he was able to walk. Then they were anxious to know who was the husband of Aponibolinayen but she would not tell them and they decided to invite everyone in the world to the ceremony that they might not overlook him.They sent for the betelnuts that were covered with gold and when they had oiled them they commanded them to go to all the towns and compel the people to come to the ceremony.If anyone refuses to come grow on his knee said the people and the betelnuts departed to do as they were bidden.As the guests began to arrive the people watched carefully for one who might be the husband of Aponibolinayen but none appeared and they were greatly troubled. Finally they went to the old woman Alokotan who was able to talk with the spirits and begged her to find what town had not been visited by the betelnuts which had been sent to invite the people. After she had consulted the spirits the old woman saidYou have invited all the people except Iniinit who lives up above. Now you must send a betelnut to summon him. It may be that he is the husband of Aponibolinayen for the siksiklat vine carried her up when she went to gather greens.So a betelnut was called and bidden to summon Iniinit.The betelnut went up to the Sun who was in his house and saidGood morning Sun. I have come to summon you to a ceremony which the father and mother of Aponibolinayen are making for the spirits. If you do not want to go I will grow on your head.Grow on my head said the Sun. I do not wish to go.So the betelnut jumped upon his head and grew until it became so tall that the Sun was not able to carry it and he was in great pain.Oh grow on my pig begged the Sun. So the betelnut jumped upon the pigs head and grew but it was so heavy that the pig could not carry it and squealed all the time. At last the Sun saw that he would have to obey the summons and he said to the betelnutGet off my pig and I will go.So Iniinit came to the ceremony and as soon as Aponibolinayen and the baby saw him they were very happy and ran to meet him. Then the people knew that this was the husband of Aponibolinayen and they waited eagerly for him to come up to them. As he drew near however they saw that he did not walk for he was round and then they perceived that he was not a man but a large stone. All her relatives were very angry to find that Aponibolinayen had married a stone and they compelled her to take off her beads and her good clothes for they said she must now dress in old clothes and go again to live with the stone.So Aponibolinayen put on the rags that they brought her and at once set out with the stone for his home. No sooner had they arrived there however than he became a handsome man and they were very happy.In one moon said the Sun we will make a ceremony for the spirits and I will pay your father and mother the marriage price for you.This pleased Aponibolinayen very much and they used magic so that they had many neighbors who came to pound ricefor them and to build a large spirit house.Then they sent oiled betelnuts to summon their relatives to the ceremony. The father of Aponibolinayen did not want to go but the betelnut threatened to grow on his knee if he did not. So he commanded all the people in the town to wash their hair and their clothes and when all was ready they set out.When they reached the town they were greatly surprised to find that the stone had become a man and they chewed the magic betelnuts to see who he might be. It was discovered that he was the son of a couple in Aponibolinayens own town and the people all rejoiced that this couple had found the son whom they had thought lost. They named him Aponitolau and his parents paid the marriage price for his wifethe spirit house nine times full of valuable jars.After that all danced and made merry for one moon and when the people departed for their homes Iniinit and his wife went with them to live on the earth.
A Boy put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped as many as he could possibly hold but when he tried to pull out his hand he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts and yet unable to withdraw his hand he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment. A bystander said to him Be satisfied with half the quantity and you will readily draw out your hand.Do not attempt too much at once.
The black pyramidal beacon called Nixs Mate is well known to yachtsmen sailors and excursionists in Boston harbor. It rises above a shoalall that is left of a fair green island which long ago disappeared in the sea. In 1636 it had an extent of twelve acres and on its highest point was a gallows where pirates were hanged in chains. One night cries were heard on board of a ship that lay at anchor a little way off shore and when the watch put off to see what might be amiss the captain named Nix was found murdered in his bed. There was no direct evidence in the case and no motive could be assigned for the deed unless it was the expectancy of promotion on the part of the mate in case of his commanders death.It was found however that this possibility gave significance to certain acts and sayings of that officer during the voyage and on circumstantial evidence so slight as this he was convicted and sentenced to death. As he was led to execution he swore that he was not guilty as he had done before and from the scaffold he cried aloud God show that I am innocent. Let this island sink and prove to these people that I have never stained my hands with human blood. Soon after the execution of his sentence it was noticed that the surf was going higher on the shore that certain rocks were no longer uncovered at low tide and in time the island wasted away. The colonists looked with awe on this manifestation and confessed that God had shown their wrong.
The idea of long wandering as a penalty symbolized in The Wandering Jew The Flying Dutchman and the character of Kundry in Parsifal has application in the legend of Peter Rugg. This strange man who lived in Middle Street Boston with his wife and daughter was esteemed as a person of probity and good manners except in his swearing fits for he was subject to outbursts of passion when he would kick his way through doors instead of opening them bite tenpenny nails in two and curse his wig off In the autumn of 1770 he visited Concord with his little girl and on the way home was overtaken by a violent storm. He took shelter with a friend at Menotomy who urged him to stay all night for the rain was falling heavier every moment but Rugg would not be stayed and seeing that there was no hope of a dry journey back to town he roared a fearful oath and cried Let the storm increase. I will see home tonight in spite of it or may I never see home With that he tossed the child into the open chaise leaped in after her lashed his horse and was off.Several nights afterward while Ruggs neighbors were out with lanterns trying to discover the cause of a heavy jarring that had begun to disturb them in bad weather the excitable gentleman who had not been seen since his Concord visit came whirling along the pavement in his carriage his daughter beside him his black horse plunging on in spite of his efforts to stop him. The lanterns that for a moment twinkled in Peters face showed him as a wet and weary man with eyes turned up longingly at the windows where his wife awaited him then he was gone and the ground trembled as with an earthquake while the rain fell more heavily.Mrs. Rugg died within a twelvemonth and Peter never reached home but from all parts of New England came stories of a man and child driving rapidly along the highways never stopping except to inquire the way to Boston. Half of the time the man would be headed in a direction opposite to the one he seemed to want to follow and when set right would cry that he was being deceived and was sometimes heard to mutter No home tonight. In Hartford Providence Newburyport and among the New Hampshire hills the anxious face of the man became known and he was referred to as the stormbreeder for so surely as he passed there would be rain wind lightning thunder and darkness within the hour.Some years ago a man in a Connecticut town stopped this hurrying traveller who said in reply to a question I have lost the road to Boston. My name is Peter Rugg. Then Ruggs disappearance half a century before was cited by those who had long memories and people began to look askant at Peter and gave him generous road room when they met him. The tolltaker on Charlestown bridge declared that he had been annoyed and alarmed by a prodigious tramping of hoofs and rattling of wheels that seemed to pass toward Boston before his very face yet he could see nothing. He took courage one night to plant himself in the middle of the bridge with a threelegged stool and when the sound approached he dimly saw a large black horse driven by a weary looking man with a child beside him. The stool was flung at the horses head but passed through the animal as through smoke and skipped across the floor of the bridge. Thus much the tollcollector said but when asked if Rugg had appeared again he made no reply.
Once upon a time in the middle of winter when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky a queen sat at a window sewing and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow she pricked her finger with the needle and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked pretty upon the white snow and she thought to herself Would that I had a child as white as snow as red as blood and as black as the wood of the windowframe.Soon after that she had a little daughter who was as white as snow and as red as blood and her hair was as black as ebony and she was therefore called Little Snowwhite. And when the child was born the Queen died.After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman but proud and haughty and she could not bear that any one else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful lookingglass and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it and saidLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of allthe lookingglass answered Thou O Queen art the fairest of allThen she was satisfied for she knew that the lookingglass spoke the truth.But Snowwhite was growing up and grew more and more beautiful and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day and more beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her lookingglass Lookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of allit answeredThou art fairer than all who are here Lady Queen.But more beautiful still is Snowwhite as I ween.Then the Queen was shocked and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour whenever she looked at Snowwhite her heart heaved in her breast she hated the girl so much.And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed so that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman and said Take the child away into the forest I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her and bring me back her heart as a token.The huntsman obeyed and took her away but when he had drawn his knife and was about to pierce Snowwhites innocent heart she began to weep and said Ah dear huntsman leave me my life I will run away into the wild forest and never come home again.And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said Run away then you poor child. The wild beasts will soon have devoured you thought he and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. And as a young boar just then came running by he stabbed it and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child was dead. The cook had to salt this and the wicked Queen ate it and thought she had eaten the heart of Snowwhite.But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest and so terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree and did not know what to do. Then she began to run and ran over sharp stones and through thorns and the wild beasts ran past her but did her no harm.She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small but neater and cleaner than can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover and seven little plates and on each plate a little spoon moreover there were seven little knives and forks and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side and covered with snowwhite counterpanes.Little Snowwhite was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then as she was so tired she laid herself down on one of the little beds but none of them suited her one was too long another too short but at last she found that the seventh one was right and so she remained in it said a prayer and went to sleep.When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back they were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore. They lit their seven candles and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that some one had been there for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it.The first said Who has been sitting on my chairThe second Who has been eating off my plateThe third Who has been taking some of my breadThe fourth Who has been eating my vegetablesThe fifth Who has been using my forkThe sixth Who has been cutting with my knifeThe seventh Who has been drinking out of my mugThen the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his bed and he said Who has been getting into my bedThe others came up and each called out Somebody has been lying in my bed too.But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snowwhite who was lying asleep therein. And he called the others who came running up and they cried out with astonishment and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snowwhite.Oh heavens oh heavens cried they what a lovely child and they were so glad that they did not wake her up but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions one hour with each and so got through the night.When it was morning little Snowwhite awoke and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her name was. My name is Snowwhite she answered.How have you come to our house said the dwarfs. Then she told them that her stepmother had wished to have her killed but that the huntsman had spared her life and that she had run for the whole day until at last she had found their dwelling.The dwarfs said If you will take care of our house cook make the beds wash sew and knit and if you will keep everything neat and clean you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing. Yes said Snowwhite with all my heart and she stayed with them. She kept the house in order for them in the mornings they went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold in the evenings they came back and then their supper had to be ready.The girl was alone the whole day so the good dwarfs warned her and said Beware of your stepmother she will soon know that you are here be sure to let no one come in.But the Queen believing that she had eaten Snowwhites heart could not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all and she went to her lookingglass and saidLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of alland the glass answeredOh Queen thou art fairest of all I seeBut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwellSnowwhite is still alive and wellAnd none is so fair as she.Then she was astounded for she knew that the lookingglass never spoke falsely and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her and that little Snowwhite was still alive. And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land envy let her have no rest. And when she had at last thought of something to do she painted her face and dressed herself like an old pedlarwoman and no one could have known her.In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs and knocked at the door and cried Pretty things to sell very cheap very cheap.Little Snowwhite looked out of the window and called out Goodday my good woman what have you to sellGood things pretty things she answered staylaces of all colours and she pulled out one which was woven of brightcoloured silk.I may let the worthy old woman in thought Snowwhite and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces. Child said the old woman what a fright you look come I will lace you properly for once.Snowwhite had no suspicion but stood before her and let herself be laced with the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and laced so tightly that Snowwhite lost her breath and fell down as if dead.Now I am the most beautiful said the Queen to herself and ran away.Not long afterwards in the evening the seven dwarfs came home but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snowwhite lying on the ground and that she neither stirred nor moved and seemed to be dead.They lifted her up and as they saw that she was laced too tightly they cut the laces then she began to breathe a little and after a while came to life again.When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said The old pedlarwoman was no one else than the wicked Queen take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.But the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and askedLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of alland it answered as before Oh Queen thou art fairest of all I seeBut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwellSnowwhite is still alive and wellAnd none is so fair as she.When she heard that all her blood rushed to her heart with fear for she saw plainly that little Snowwhite was again alive.But now she said I will think of something that shall put an end to you and by the help of witchcraft which she understood she made a poisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs knocked at the door and cried Good things to sell cheap cheapLittle Snowwhite looked out and said Go away I cannot let any one come in.I suppose you can look said the old woman and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled and opened the door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said Now I will comb you properly for once.Poor little Snowwhite had no suspicion and let the old woman do as she pleased but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect and the girl fell down senseless.You paragon of beauty said the wicked woman you are done for now and she went away.But fortunately it was almost evening when the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snowwhite lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the stepmother and they looked and found the poisoned comb. Scarcely had they taken it out when Snowwhite came to herself and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one.The Queen at home went in front of the glass and saidLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of allthen it answered as beforeOh Queen thou art fairest of all I seeBut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwellSnowwhite is still alive and wellAnd none is so fair as she.When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage. Snowwhite shall die she cried even if it costs me my lifeThereupon she went into a quite secret lonely room where no one ever came and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty white with a red cheek so that every one who saw it longed for it but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.When the apple was ready she painted her face and dressed herself up as a countrywoman and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked at the door. Snow white put her head out of the window and said I cannot let any one in the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.It is all the same to me answered the woman I shall soon get rid of my apples. There I will give you one.No said Snowwhite I dare not take anything.Are you afraid of poison said the old woman look I will cut the apple in two pieces you eat the red cheek and I will eat the white.The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snowwhite longed for the fine apple and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer and stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look and laughed aloud and said White as snow red as blood black as ebonywood this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.And when she asked of the Lookingglass at homeLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of allit answered at lastOh Queen in this land thou art fairest of all.Then her envious heart had rest so far as an envious heart can have rest.The dwarfs when they came home in the evening found Snowwhite lying upon the ground she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous unlaced her combed her hair washed her with water and wine but it was all of no use the poor child was dead and remained dead. They laid her upon a bier and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her and wept three days long.Then they were going to bury her but she still looked as if she were living and still had her pretty red cheeks. They said We could not bury her in the dark ground and they had a transparent coffin of glass made so that she could be seen from all sides and they laid her in it and wrote her name upon it in golden letters and that she was a kings daughter.Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain and one of them always stayed by it and watched it. And birds came too and wept for Snowwhite first an owl then a raven and last a dove.And now Snowwhite lay a long long time in the coffin and she did not change but looked as if she were asleep for she was as white as snow as red as blood and her hair was as black as ebony.It happened however that a kings son came into the forest and went to the dwarfs house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain and the beautiful Snowwhite within it and read what was written upon it in golden letters.Then he said to the dwarfs Let me have the coffin I will give you whatever you want for it.But the dwarfs answered We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.Then he said Let me have it as a gift for I cannot live without seeing Snowwhite. I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession. As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him and gave him the coffin.And now the Kings son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a treestump and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snowwhite had bitten off came out of her throat.And before long she opened her eyes lifted up the lid of the coffin sat up and was once more alive.Oh heavens where am I she cried.The Kings son full of joy said You are with me and told her what had happened and said I love you more than everything in the world come with me to my fathers palace you shall be my wife.And Snowwhite was willing and went with him and their wedding was held with great show and splendour. But Snowwhites wicked stepmother was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the Lookingglass and saidLookingglass Lookingglass on the wallWho in this land is the fairest of allthe glass answeredOh Queen of all here the fairest art thouBut the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow.Then the wicked woman uttered a curse and was so wretched so utterly wretched that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all but she had no peace and must go to see the young Queen.And when she went in she knew Snowwhite and she stood still with rage and fear and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire and they were brought in with tongs and set before her. Then she was forced to put on the redhot shoes and dance until she dropped down dead.
There was a wealthy a very wealthy proprietor he had buildings enough there was where and wherewith for every purpose. Once upon a time he had guests at his house and said to them If my buildings were to be burnt down I should know where and how to rebuild them. He said and it came to pass. While he was conversing thus with his guests somebody went out into the courtyard but returned still quicker and said Youre on fire But the proprietor said Never mind I wish it to be so. He neither attempted to extinguish the fire himself nor allowed others to do so and thus all was reduced to ashes only the site was left. But he didnt trouble himself a bit but went and lived by the waterside and kept his money in a willowtree being thus a source of danger to himself. Unexpectedly a heavy rain fell and before he could look about him the water had already undermined the willow and carried it away. He then became poor so that it became his lot to serve others. He was obliged to carry letters for gentlemen.Well it came to pass once that he was going with a letter and night overtook him on the way what was he now to do He begged a nights lodging at a certain mans house this man was rich and kindly so he said Good you shall not pass my house. Meanwhile the mistress prepared supper and after supping they prayed to God but before they lay down to sleep they conversed together about this and that. The traveller began to relate how he had himself been wealthy how he had been burnt out and had come to poverty. I had said he still a little money and kept it in a willowtree but great floods came undermined the willow and carried my money away with the water Thus I remained with nothing and now it has been my lot more than once to beg for bread.Scarcely had his host heard this when he looked at his wife for the willow had floated to shore under their barn and when they began to cut it up the money tumbled out a little at a time. They both went out into a room and began to consult how to return the money to him without his knowing whence it came. They consulted. Then said the host Well what shall we do Let us cut off the under part of a loaf take out the crumb put the money inside then cover it again with the crust and when he is on the point of departing let us give it him as if it were provision for his journey. And so they did. The next day when he was starting to proceed on his way they gave him the loaf of bread and said Heres for you it will be of use on the road. He took it made his bow and went on his way. On the road there met him some merchantspardon me some droverspurchasing swine who had formerly visited him more than once and they asked him Of course you know what were after and he replied Formerly it was at my house misfortune has come upon me Ive been burnt out and now I serve others. When he had spoken these words he all at once gave his knapsack a tap and said Come buy some bread. He took it out. Somehow Im not hungry and its heavy to carry some money would be more advantageous on my journey. Bargain and sale. They came to an agreement. The merchants took the bread and he the money and they parted.The merchants came to that very same village and went to the house of that very same proprietor from whom the bread came and began to make inquiries of him respecting their business. Not I but God said he sit down meanwhile and rest and he sent for a snack for them. But they said to him that he neednt trouble himself. On the road we bought a loaf of excellent bread from a man who was going with a letter. They the host and his wife felt a quaking at the heart they had a suspicion but the merchants soon took it out and placed it on the table the very same loaf which they had given to the traveller. The proprietor looked at his wife and said to their guests Before anything is done let us go and have a look round maybe you will make a purchase. Let us go and they went out of the house but he winked to his wife and she knew at once what he wanted. When they went out on their business the mistress brought out another loaf and placed it on the table but removed the first one. They returned breakfasted either did or didnt come to terms and went away.After some time the man came again with a letter and turned in again at the proprietors just as at an old acquaintances for the night. They received him and were glad for they thought they might now be successful in returning the money somehow or other. They waited they passed the night and when he had gone out of the house they wrapped the money in a cloth put it in his knapsack gave him breakfast and dismissed him He went off and as he went by a footpath through the orchard he bethought himself Ah what beautiful apples Come let me pluck a few for my journey. He took off his knapsack and hung it on a tree that it mightnt embarrass him and began himself to reach after the apples. Just then up came his host the proprietor. He saw him and took flight so much the quicker leaving his knapsack on the tree.The proprietor espied the knapsack hanging on a branch began to think and afterwards also said The poor fellow was frightened and has forgotten his knapsack. He took down the knapsack and said His road goes to the footbridge he ran away through the bushes that he mightnt see me. Ill put it on the bridge and then hell be sure to take it up. Even so he did. He ran round sideways placed the money on the bridge and went himself behind a bush not very far off to keep a lookout and see what would happen.Suddenly the traveller came up to the bridge and looking downwards thought and afterwards said Its good that I still have some sight at any rate and can go on my way and earn something to get my bread. What should I do if I were to go blind How should I get across this bridge Come Ill see whether I could do it successfully. Then closing his eyes tap tap with his stick over the bridge he went straight forwards stepped over the money and went his way. The proprietor recovering from his astonishment said aloud He has angered God
Once upon a time there was a man named Du Dsi Tschun. In his youth he was a spendthrift and paid no heed to his property. He was given to drink and idling. When he had run through all his money his relatives cast him out. One winter day he was walking barefoot about the city with an empty stomach and torn clothes. Evening came on and still he had not found any food. Without end or aim he wandered about the market place. He was hungry and the cold seemed well nigh unendurable. So he turned his eyes upward and began to lament aloud.Suddenly an ancient man stood before him leaning on a staff who said What do you lack since you complain soI am dying of hunger replied Du Dsi Tschun and not a soul will take pity on meThe ancient man said How much money would you need in order to live in all comfortIf I had fifty thousand pieces of copper it would answer my purpose replied Du Dsi Tschun.The ancient said That would not answer.Well then a millionThat is still too littleWell then three millionThe ancient man said That is well spoken He fetched a thousand pieces of copper out of his sleeve and said That is for this evening. Expect me tomorrow by noon at the Persian BazaarAt the time set Du Dsi Tschun went there and sure enough there was the ancient who gave him three million pieces of copper. Then he disappeared without giving his name.When Du Dsi Tschun held the money in his hand his love for prodigality once more awoke. He rode pampered steeds clothed himself in the finest furs went back to his wine and led such an extravagant life that the money gradually came to an end. Instead of wearing brocade he had to wear cotton and instead of riding horseback he went to the dogs. Finally he was again running about barefoot and in rags as before and did not know how to satisfy his hunger. Once more he stood in the marketplace and sighed. But the ancient was already there took him by the hand and said Are you back already to where you were That is strange However I will aid you once moreBut Du Dsi Tschun was ashamed and did not want to accept his help. Yet the ancient insisted and led him along to the Persian Bazaar. This time he gave him ten million pieces of copper and Du Dsi Tschun thanked him with shame in his heart.With money in hand he tried to give time to adding to it and saving in order to gain great wealth. But as is always the case it is hard to overcome ingrown faults. Gradually he began to fling his money away again and gave free rein to all his desires. And once more his purse grew empty. In a couple of years he was as poor as ever he had been.Then he met the ancient the third time but was so ashamed of himself that he hid his face when he passed him.The ancient seized his arm and said Where are you going I will help you once more. I will give you thirty million. But if then you do not improve you are past all aidFull of gratitude Du Dsi Tschun bowed before him and said In the days of my poverty my wealthy relatives did not seek me out. You alone have thrice aided me. The money you give me today shall not be squandered that I swear but I will devote it to good works in order to repay your great kindness. And when I have done this I will follow you if needs be through fire and through water.The ancient replied That is right When you have ordered these things ask for me in the temple of Laotsze beneath the two mulberry treesDu Dsi Tschun took the money and went to Yangdschou. There he bought a hundred acres of the best land and built a lofty house with many hundreds of rooms on the highway. And there he allowed widows and orphans to live. Then he bought a burialplace for his ancestors and supported his needy relations. Countless people were indebted to him for their livelihood.When all was finished he went to inquire after the ancient in the temple of Laotsze. The ancient was sitting in the shade of the mulberry trees blowing the flute. He took Du Dsi Tschun along with him to the cloudy peaks of the holy mountains of the West. When they had gone some forty miles into the mountains he saw a dwelling fair and clean. It was surrounded by manycolored clouds and peacocks and cranes were flying about it. Within the house was a herboven nine feet high. The fire burned with a purple flame and its glow leaped along the walls. Nine fairies stood at the oven and a green dragon and a white tiger crouched beside it. Evening came. The ancient was no longer clad like an ordinary man but wore a yellow cap and wide flowing garments. He took three pellets of the White Stone put them into a flagon of wine and gave them to Du Dsi Tschun to drink. He spread out a tigerskin against the western wall of the inner chamber and bade Du Dsi Tschun sit down on it with his face turned toward the East. Then he said to him Now beware of speaking a single wordno matter what happens to you whether you encounter powerful gods or terrible demons wild beasts or ogres or all the tortures of the nether world or even if you see your own relatives sufferfor all these things are only deceitful images They cannot harm you. Think only of what I have said and let your soul be at rest And when he had said this the ancient disappeared.Then Du Dsi Tschun saw only a large stone jug full of clear water standing before him. Fairies dragon and tiger had all vanished. Suddenly he heard a tremendous crash which made heaven and earth tremble. A man towering more than ten feet in height appeared. He called himself the great captain and he and his horse were covered with golden armor. He was surrounded by more than a hundred soldiers who drew their bows and swung their swords and halted in the courtyard.The giant called out harshly Who are you Get out of my wayDu Dsi Tschun did not move. And he returned no answer to his questions.Then the giant flew into a passion and cried with a thundering voice Chop off his headBut Du Dsi Tschun remained unmoved so the giant went off raging.Then a furious tiger and a poisonous serpent came up roaring and hissing. They made as though to bite him and leaped over him. But Du Dsi Tschun remained unperturbed in spirit and after a time they dissolved and vanished.Suddenly a great rain began to fall in streams. It thundered and lightninged incessantly so that his ears rang and his eyes were blinded. It seemed as though the house would fall. The water rose to a flood in a few moments time and streamed up to the place where he was sitting. But Du Dsi Tschun remained motionless and paid no attention to it. And after a time the water receded.Then came a great demon with the head of an ox. He set up a kettle in the middle of the courtyard in which bubbled boiling oil. He caught Du Dsi Tschun by the neck with an iron fork and said If you will tell me who you are I will let you goDu Dsi Tschun shut his eyes and kept silent. Then the demon picked him up with the fork and flung him into the kettle. He withstood the pain and the boiling oil did not harm him. Finally the demon dragged him out again and drew him down the steps of the house before a man with red hair and a blue face who looked like the prince of the nether world. The latter cried Drag in his wifeAfter a time Du Dsi Tschuns wife was brought on in chains. Her hair was torn and she wept bitterly.The demon pointed to Du Dsi Tschun and said If you will speak your name we will let her goBut he answered not a word.Then the prince of evil had the woman tormented in all sorts of ways. And she pleaded with Du Dsi Tschun I have been your wife now for ten years. Will you not speak one little word to save me I can endure no more And the tears ran in streams from her eyes. She screamed and scolded. Yet he spoke not a word.Thereupon the prince of evil shouted Chop her into bits And there before his eyes it seemed as though she were really being chopped to pieces. But Du Dsi Tschun did not move.The scoundrels measure is full cried the prince of evil. He shall dwell no longer among the living Off with his head And so they killed him and it seemed to him that his soul fled his body. The oxheaded demon dragged him down into the nether regions where he tasted all the tortures in turn. But Du Dsi Tschun remembered the words of the ancient. And the tortures too seemed bearable. So he did not scream and said not a word.Now he was once more dragged before the prince of evil. The latter said As punishment for his obstinacy this man shall come to earth again in the shape of a womanThe demon dragged him to the wheel of life and he returned to earth in the shape of a girl. He was often ill had to take medicine continually and was pricked and burned with hot needles. Yet he never uttered a sound. Gradually he grew into a beautiful maiden. But since he never spoke he was known as the dumb maid. A scholar finally took him for his bride and they lived in peace and good fellowship. And a son came to them who in the course of two years was already beyond measure wise and intelligent. One day the father was carrying the son on his arm. He spoke jestingly to his wife and said When I look at you it seems to me that you are not really dumb. Wont you say one little word to me How delightful it would be if you were to become my speaking roseThe woman remained silent. No matter how he might coax and try to make her smile she would return no answer.Then his features changed If you will not speak to me it is a sign that you scorn me and in that case your son is nothing to me either And with that he seized the boy and flung him against the wall.But since Du Dsi Tschun loved this little boy so dearly he forgot the ancients warning and cried out Oh ohAnd before the cry had died away Du Dsi Tschun awoke as though from a dream and found himself seated in his former place. The ancient was there as well. It must have been about the fifth hour of the night. Purple flames rose wildly from the oven and flared up to the sky. The whole house caught fire and burned like a torch.You have deceived me cried the ancient. Then he seized him by the hair and thrust him into the jug of water. And in a minute the fire went out. The ancient spoke You overcame joy and rage grief and fear hate and desire it is true but love you had not driven from your soul. Had you not cried out when the child was flung against the wall then my elixir would have taken shape and you would have attained immortality. But in the last moment you failed me. Now it is too late. Now I can begin brewing my elixir of life once more from the beginning and you will remain a mere mortal manDu Dsi Tschun saw that the oven had burst and that instead of the philosophers stone it held only a lump of iron. The ancient man cast aside his garments and chopped it up with a magic knife. Du Dsi Tschun took leave of him and returned to Yangdschou where he lived in great affluence. In his old age he regretted that he had not completed his task. He once more went to the mountain to look for the ancient. But the ancient had vanished without leaving a trace.Note The pieces of copper are the ancient Chinese copper coins with a hole in the middle usually hung on strings to the number of 500 or 1000. Money had a greater purchasing value in ancient China however than in the China of today. The Persian Bazaar During the reign of the Tang dynasty China maintained an active intercourse with the West traces of which are at present being investigated in Central Asia. At that time Persian bazaars were no novelty in the city of SiAnFu then the capital. Herboven a tripod kettle used for brewing the elixir of life with which the fairies dragon and tiger both the lastmentioned starincarnations are connected. In order to prepare the elixir the master must have absolute endurance. It is for this reason that he had placed Du Dsi Tschun in his debt by means of kindness. The yellow cap which the master wears is connected with the teachings of the Yellow Ancient comp. w. No. 15. The prince of the nether world Yan Wang or Yan Lo Wang is the Indian god Yama. There are in all ten princes of the nether world of whom the fifth is the highest and most feared. Obstinacy literally his real offense is reticence or the keeping secret of a thing. This quality belongs to the Yin the dark or feminine principle and determines Du Dsi Tschuns reappearance on earth as a woman. Purple flames rose wildly from the oven Though Du Dsi Tschun had overcome his other emotions so that fear and terror did not affect him love and love in its highest form motherlove still remained in him. This love created the flames which threatened to destroy the building. The highest point in Taoismas in Buddhismis however the absolute negation of all feeling.
There once lived a man who was very poor and who had many children so many that he was unable to support them. As he could not endure the idea of their perishing of hunger he was often tempted to destroy them his wife alone prevented him. One night as he lay asleep there appeared to him a lovely child in a vision. The child saidOh man I see your soul is in danger in the thought of killing your helpless children. But I know you are poor and am come here to help you. You will find under your pillow in the morning a lookingglass a red handkerchief and an embroidered scarf. Take these three things but show them to no one and go to the forest. In that forest you will find a rivulet. Walk by the side of this rivulet until you come to its source there you will see a girl as bright as the sun with long hair streaming down her shoulders. Take care that she does you no harm. Say not a word to her for if you utter a single syllable she will change you into a fish or some other creature and eat you. Should she ask you to comb her hair obey her. As you comb it you will find one hair as red as blood pull it out and run away with it. Be swift for she will follow you. Then throw on the ground first the embroidered scarf then the red handkerchief and last of all the lookingglass they will delay her pursuit of you. Sell the hair to some rich man but see that you do not allow yourself to be cheated for it is of boundless worth. Its produce will make you rich and thus you will be able to feed your children.Next morning when the poor man awoke he found under his pillow exactly the things the child had told him of in his dream. He went immediately into the forest and when he had discovered the rivulet he walked by the side of it on and on until he reached its source. There he saw a girl sitting on the bank threading a needle with the rays of the sun. She was embroidering a net made of the hair of heroes spread on a frame before her. He approached and bowed to her. The girl got up and demandedWhere did you come from strange knightThe man remained silent. Again she asked himWho are you and why do you come here And many other questions. But he remained silent as a stone indicating with his hands only that he was dumb and in need of help. She told him to sit at her feet and when he had gladly done so she inclined her head towards him that he might comb her hair. He began to arrange her hair as if to comb it but as soon as he had found the red one he separated it from the rest plucked it out leapt up and ran from her with his utmost speed.The girl sprang after him and was soon at his heels. The man turning round as he ran and seeing that his pursuer would soon overtake him threw the embroidered scarf on the ground as he had been told. When the girl saw it she stopped and began to examine it turning it over on both sides and admiring the embroidery. Meanwhile the man gained a considerable distance in advance. The girl tied the scarf round her bosom and recommenced the pursuit. When the man saw that she was again about to overtake him he threw down the red handkerchief. At the sight of it the girl again stopped examined and wondered at it the peasant in the meantime was again enabled to increase the distance between them. When the girl perceived this she became furious and throwing away both scarf and handkerchief began to run with increased speed after him. She was just upon the point of catching the poor peasant when he threw the lookingglass at her feet. At the sight of the lookingglass the like of which she had never seen before the girl checked herself picked it up and looked in it. Seeing her own face she fancied there was another girl looking at her. While she was thus occupied the man ran so far that she could not possibly overtake him. When the girl saw that further pursuit was useless she turned back and the peasant joyful and unhurt reached his home. Once within doors he showed the hair to his wife and children and told them all that had happened to him but his wife only laughed at the story. The peasant however took no heed of her ridicule but went to a neighbouring town to sell the hair. He was soon surrounded by a crowd of people and some merchants began to bid for his prize. One merchant offered him one gold piece another two for the single hair and so on until the price rose to a hundred gold pieces. Meanwhile the king hearing of the wonderful red hair ordered the peasant to be called in and offered him a thousand gold pieces for it. The man joyfully sold it for that sum.What wonderful kind of hair was this after all The king split it carefully open from end to end and in it was found the story of many marvellous secrets of nature and of things that had happened since the creation of the world.Thus the peasant became rich and henceforth lived happily with his wife and children. The child he had seen in his dream was an angel sent down from heaven to succour him and to reveal to mankind the knowledge of many wonderful things which had hitherto remained unexplained.
Little Tuk An odd name to be sure However it was not the little boys real name. His real name was Carl but when he was so young that he could not speak plainly he used to call himself Tuk. It would be hard to say why for it is not at all like Carl but the name does as well as any if one only knows it.Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his sister Gustava who was much younger than himself and he had also to learn his lesson. Here were two things to be done at the same time and they did not at all suit each other. The poor boy sat with his sister in his lap singing to her all the songs he knew yet giving now and then a glance into his geography which lay open beside him. By tomorrow morning he must know the names of all the towns in Seeland by heart and be able to tell about them all that could be told.His mother came at last and took little Gustava in her arms. Tuk ran quickly to the window and read and read till he had almost read his eyes outfor it was growing dark and his mother could not afford to buy candles.There goes the old washerwoman down the lane said the mother as she looked out of the window. She can hardly drag herself along poor thing and now she has to carry that heavy pail from the pump. Be a good boy little Tuk and run across to help the poor creature will you not And little Tuk ran quickly and helped to bear the weight of the pail. But when he came back into the room it was quite dark. Nothing was said about a candle and it was of no use to wish for one he must go to his little trundlebed which was made of an old settle.There he lay still thinking of the geography lesson of Seeland and of all that the master had said. He could not read the book again as he should by rights have done for want of a light. So he put the geographybook under his pillow. Somebody had once told him that would help him wonderfully to remember his lesson but he had never yet found that one could depend upon it.There he lay and thought and thought till all at once he felt as though some one were gently sealing his mouth and eyes with a kiss. He slept and yet did not sleep for he seemed to see the old washerwomans mild kind eyes fixed upon him and to hear her say It would be a shame indeed for you not to know your lesson tomorrow little Tuk. You helped me now I will help you and our Lord will help us both.All at once the leaves of the book began to rustle under little Tuks head and he heard something crawling about under his pillow.Cluck cluck cluck cried a hen as she crept towards him. She came from the town of Kjge. Im a Kjge hen she said. And then she told him how many inhabitants the little town contained and about the battle that had once been fought there and how it was now hardly worth mentioning there were so many greater things.Scratch scratch kribbley crabbley and now a great wooden bird jumped down upon the bed. It was the popinjay from the shooting ground at Prst. He had reckoned the number of inhabitants in Prst and found that there were as many as he had nails in his body. He was a proud bird. Thorwaldsen lived in one corner of Prst close by me. Am I not a pretty bird a merry popinjayAnd now little Tuk no longer lay in bed. All in a moment he was on horseback and on he went gallop gallop A splendid knight with a bright helmet and waving plumea knight of the olden timeheld him on his own horse and on they rode together through the wood of the ancient city of Vordingborg and it was once again a great and busy town. The high towers of the kings castle rose against the sky and bright lights were seen gleaming through the windows. Within were music and merrymaking. King Waldemar was leading out the noble ladies of his court to dance with him.Suddenly the morning dawned the lamps grew pale the sun rose the outlines of the buildings faded away and at last one high tower alone remained to mark the spot where the royal castle had stood. The vast city had shrunk into a poor meanlooking little town. The schoolboys coming out of school with their geographybooks under their arms said Two thousand inhabitants but that was a mere boast for the town had not nearly so many.And little Tuk lay in his bed. He knew not whether he had been dreaming or not but again there was some one close by his side.Little Tuk little Tuk cried a voice it was the voice of a young sailor boy. I am come to bring you greeting from Korsr. Korsr is a new town a living town with steamers and mail coaches. Once people used to call it a low ugly place but they do so no longer.I dwell by the seaside says Korsr I have broad highroads and pleasure gardens and I have given birth to a poet a witty one too which is more than all poets are. I once thought of sending a ship all round the world but I did not do it though I might as well have done so. I dwell so pleasantly close by the port and I am fragrant with perfume for the loveliest roses bloom round about me close to my gates.And little Tuk could smell the roses and see them and their fresh green leaves. But in a moment they had vanished the green leaves spread and thickeneda perfect grove had grown up above the bright waters of the bay and above the grove rose the two highpointed towers of a glorious old church. From the side of the grassgrown hill gushed a fountain in rainbowhued streams with a merry musical voice and close beside it sat a king wearing a gold crown upon his long dark hair. This was King Hroar of the springs and hard by was the town of Roskilde Hroars Fountain. And up the hill on a broad highway went all the kings and queens of Denmark wearing golden crowns hand in hand they passed on into the church and the deep music of the organ mingled with the clear rippling of the fountain. For nearly all the kings and queens of Denmark lie buried in this beautiful church. And little Tuk saw and heard it all.Dont forget the towns said King Hroar.Then all vanished though where it went he knew not. It seemed like turning the leaves of a book.And now there stood before him an old peasant woman from Sor the quiet little town where grass grows in the very market place. Her green linen apron was thrown over her head and back and the apron was very wet as if it had been raining heavily.And so it has she said. And she told a great many pretty things from Holbergs comedies and recited ballads about Waldemar and Absalon for Holberg had founded an academy in her native town.All at once she cowered down and rocked her head as if she were a frog about to spring. Koax cried she it is wet it is always wet and it is as still as the grave in Sor. She had changed into a frog. Koax and again she was an old woman. One must dress according to the weather she said.It is wet it is wet My native town is like a bottle one goes in at the cork and by the cork one must come out. In old times we had the finest of fish now we have fresh rosycheeked boys at the bottom of the bottle. There they learn wisdomGreek Greek and Hebrew KoaxIt sounded exactly as if frogs were croaking or as if some one were walking over the great swamp with heavy boots. So tiresome was her tone all on the same note that little Tuk fell fast asleep and a very good thing it was for him.But even in sleep there came a dream or whatever else it may be called. His little sister Gustava with her blue eyes and flaxen ringlets was grown into a tall beautiful girl who though she had no wings could fly and away they now flew over Seelandover its green woods and blue waters.Hark Do you hear the cock crow little Tuk Cockadoodledo The fowls are flying hither from Kjge and you shall have a farmyard a great great poultry yard of your own You shall never suffer hunger or want. The golden goose the bird of good omen shall be yours you shall become a rich and happy man. Your house shall rise up like King Waldemars towers and be richly decked with statues like those of Thorwaldsen at Prst.Understand me well your good name shall be borne round the world like the ship that was to sail from Korsr and at Roskilde you shall speak and give counsel wisely and well little Tuk like King Hroar and when at last you shall lie in your peaceful grave you shall sleep as quietlyAs if I lay sleeping in Sor said Tuk and he woke. It was a bright morning and he could not remember his dream but it was not necessary that he should. One has no need to know what one will live to see.And now he sprang quickly out of bed and sought his book that had lain under his pillow. He read his lesson and found that he knew the towns perfectly well.And the old washerwoman put her head in at the door and said with a friendly nod Thank you my good child for yesterdays help. May the Lord fulfill your brightest and most beautiful dreams I know he will.Little Tuk had forgotten what he had dreamed but it did not matter. There was One above who knew it all.
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings. The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion and thought that there was no one like him in the world till byandby it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp Andras Baive by name who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff. Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense why let themThe winter was long and cold and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive when suddenly on a frosty day he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso. The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour. As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eightoared boat that lay upon the shore and his face shone with pleasure. That is the very thing laughed he I will make him jump over that boat. Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge and they soon settled the terms of the wager. He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner and would get a large sum of money as the prize. So followed by many of the villagers the two men walked down to the sea.An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play and to hold the stakes and Andras as the stranger was told to jump first. Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place he ran forward with his head well thrown back and cleared the boat with a mighty bound. The lookers on cheered him and indeed he well deserve it but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do. On he came taller than Andras by several inches but heavier of build. He too sprang high and well but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat. Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk but Andras only laughed and said carelesslyJust a little too short bailiff next time you must do better than that.The bailiff turned red with anger at his rivals scornful words and answered quickly Next time you will have something harder to do. And turning his back on his friends he went sulkily home. Andras putting the money he had earned in his pocket went home also.The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso. A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off and the bailiff disguising himself as a Stalo or ogre called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras.Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump. He wandered on his eyes fixed on the sands so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves. A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage. Dear me I may find some use for that he said and hastened down to the sea waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him. Suddenlyhe could not have told whya nameless fear seized upon him and he fled away from the shore as if for his life. As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat Next time you will have something harder to do. So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen but the bailiff himself.It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain where the sun never set and it was very difficult to get to sleep Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic and this stood him in good stead now. The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles. Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing. Nothing he could see but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain and ever as he listened it drew nearer.A cold shiver shook Andras and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf. For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him. A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living. Yes but not so swift as a Stalo as Andras found out when he stopped to rest and heard the pipe playingFor a moment his heart sank and he gave himself up for dead till he remembered that not far off were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river. In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water except in dry seasons and as the winter rains had been very heavy he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen. The next minute if anyone had been looking that way he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards and byandby giving a great spring which landed him in the midst of the stream. But instead of sinking to the bottom he paused a second to steady himself then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore. He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was.Ah There you are cried the Stalo appearing on the opposite bank for a moment I really thought I had lost you.No such luck answered Andras shaking his head sorrowfully. By this time he had taken his own shape again.Well but I dont see how I am to get to you said the Stalo looking up and down.Jump over as I did answered Andras it is quite easy.But I could not jump this river and I dont know how you did replied the Stalo.I should be ashamed to say such things exclaimed Andras. Do you mean to tell me that a jump which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of is beyond your strengthAndras Baive shoots the Stalo.Illustration by H.J Ford published in The Orange Fairy Book by Andrew Lang 1906 Longmans Green and Company.The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words just as Andras meant him to do. He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river. Not that that would have mattered for he was a good swimmer but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries and took aim at him. His aim was good but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet. A second shot directed at his forehead fared no better for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb. Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalos head and when he sprang up just an instant too soon it hit him between the ribs.Mortally wounded as he was the Stalo was not yet dead and managed to swim to the shore. Stretching himself on the sand he said slowly to AndrasPromise that you will give me an honourable burial and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me. My dog you must kill but spare my son Andras.Then he died and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy. The dog a fierce wickedlooking creature he slew with one blow from his fist for it is well known that if a Stalos dog licks the blood that flows from his dead masters wounds the Stalo comes to life again. That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog but the bailiff being only half a Stalo had forgotten him when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras. Next Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets and bidding the boy get in pushed it off from the shore leaving the little craft to drift as it would while he himself ran home. With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer and he soon married a rich wife whose parents would not have him as a soninlaw when he was poor and the two lived happy for ever after.
There lived in a certain place a Brahman whose name was Svabhavakripana which means a born miser. He had collected a quantity of rice by begging and after having dined off it he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall placed his couch beneath and looking intently at it all the night he thought Ah that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now if there should be a famine I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then with the goats I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved I shall sell the calves. Then with the calves I shall buy buffaloes with the buffaloes mares. When the mares have foaled I shall have plenty of horses and when I sell them plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house and will give me his beautiful daughter with a large dowry. She will have a son and I shall call him Somasarman. When he is old enough to be danced on his fathers knee I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable and while I am reading the boy will see me jump from his mothers lap and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horses hoof and full of anger I shall call to my wife Take the baby take him But she distracted by some domestic work does not hear me. Then I get up and give her such a kick with my foot. While he thought this he gave a kick with his foot and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him and made him quite white. Therefore I say He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over like the father of Somasarman.
There are three lords in heaven and on the earth and in the waters and they are known as the Three Ruling Gods. They are all brothers and are descended from the father of the Monk of the Yangtzekiang. When the latter was sailing on the river he was cast into the water by a robber. But he did not drown for a Triton came his way who took him along with him to the dragoncastle. And when the DragonKing saw him he realized at once that there was something extraordinary about the Monk and he married him to his daughter.From their early youth his three sons showed a preference for the hidden wisdom. And together they went to an island in the sea. There they seated themselves and began to meditate. They heard nothing they saw nothing they spoke not a word and they did not move. The birds came and nested in their hair the spiders came and wove webs across their faces worms and insects came and crawled in and out of their noses and ears. But they paid no attention to any of them.After they had meditated thus for a number of years they obtained the hidden wisdom and became gods. And the Lord made them the Three Ruling Gods. The heavens make things the earth completes things and the waters create things. The Three Ruling Gods sent out the current of their primal power to aid in ordering all to this end. Therefore they are also known as the primal gods and temples are erected to them all over the earth.If you go into a temple you will find the Three Ruling Gods all seated on one pedestal. They wear womens hats upon their heads and hold scepters in their hands like kings. But he who sits on the last place to the right has glaring eyes and wears a look of rage. If you ask why this is you are told These three were brothers and the Lord made them the Ruling Gods. So they talked about the order in which they were to sit. And the youngest said Tomorrow morning before sunrise we will meet here. Whoever gets here first shall have the seat of honor in the middle the second one to arrive shall have the second place and the third the third.The two older brothers were satisfied. The next morning very early the youngest came first seated himself in the middle place and became the god of the waters. The middle brother came next sat down on the left and became the god of the heavens. Last of all came the oldest brother. When he saw that his brothers were already sitting in their places he was disgusted and yet he could not say a word. His face grew red with rage his eyeballs stood forth from their sockets like bullets and his veins swelled like bladders. And he seated himself on the right and became god of the earth. The artisans who make the images of the gods noticed this so they always represent him thus.Note The Three Ruling Gods is set down as told by the people. It is undoubtedly a version of the Indian Trimurti. The meaning of the terrible appearance of the third godhead evidently no longer understood by the people points to Siva and has given rise to the fairytale here told.
A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home promising her a rich reward for her trouble. The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft. On their way they met a Crow who said to the Eagle Tortoise is good eating. The shell is too hard said the Eagle in reply. The rocks will soon crack the shell was the Crows answer and the Eagle taking the hint let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise. Never soar aloft on an enemys pinions.
Once there was a very learned physician who died leaving his wife with a little baby boy whom when he was old enough she named according to his fathers wish Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen.When the boy had been to school and had learned to read his mother sent him to a tailor to learn his trade but he could not learn it. Then he was sent to a silversmith but he could not learn his trade either. After that he tried many trades but could learn none of them. At last his mother said Well stay at home for a while and that seemed to suit him. One day he asked his mother what his fathers business had been and she told him he was a very great physician.Where are his books he asked.Well its a long time since I saw them replied his mother but I think they are behind there. Look and see.So he hunted around a little and at last found them but they were almost ruined by insects and he gained little from them.At last four of the neighbors came to his mother and said Let your boy go along with us and cut wood in the forest. It was their business to cut wood load it on donkeys and sell it in the town for making fires.All right said she tomorrow Ill buy him a donkey and he can start fair with you.So the next day Hasseeboo with his donkey went off with those four persons and they worked very hard and made a lot of money that day. This continued for six days but on the seventh day it rained heavily and they had to get under the rocks to keep dry.Now Hasseeboo sat in a place by himself and having nothing else to do he picked up a stone and began knocking on the ground with it. To his surprise the ground gave forth a hollow sound and he called to his companions saying There seems to be a hole under here.Upon hearing him knock again they decided to dig and see what was the cause of the hollow sound and they had not gone very deep before they broke into a large pit like a well which was filled to the top with honey.They didnt do any firewood chopping after that but devoted their entire attention to the collection and sale of the honey.With a view to getting it all out as quickly as possible they told Hasseeboo to go down into the pit and dip out the honey while they put it in vessels and took it to town for sale. They worked for three days making a great deal of money.At last there was only a little honey left at the very bottom of the pit and they told the boy to scrape that together while they went to get a rope to haul him out.But instead of getting the rope they decided to let him remain in the pit and divide the money among themselves. So when he had gathered the remainder of the honey together and called for the rope he received no answer and after he had been alone in the pit for three days he became convinced that his companions had deserted him.Then those four persons went to his mother and told her that they had become separated in the forest that they had heard a lion roaring and that they could find no trace of either her son or his donkey.His mother of course cried very much and the four neighbors pocketed her sons share of the money.To return to Hasseeboo.He passed the time walking about the pit wondering what the end would be eating scraps of honey sleeping a little and sitting down to think.While engaged in the last occupation on the fourth day he saw a scorpion fall to the grounda large one tooand he killed it.Then suddenly he thought to himself Where did that scorpion come from There must be a hole somewhere. Ill search anyhow.So he searched around until he saw light through a tiny crack and he took his knife and scooped and scooped until he had made a hole big enough to pass through then he went out and came upon a place he had never seen before.Seeing a path he followed it until he came to a very large house the door of which was not fastened. So he went inside and saw golden doors with golden locks and keys of pearl and beautiful chairs inlaid with jewels and precious stones and in a reception room he saw a couch covered with a splendid spread upon which he lay down.Presently he found himself being lifted off the couch and put in a chair and heard some one saying Do not hurt him wake him gently and on opening his eyes he found himself surrounded by numbers of snakes one of them wearing beautiful royal colors.Hullo he cried who are youI am Sultanee Waa Neeoka king of the snakes and this is my house. Who are youI am Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen.Where do you come fromI dont know where I come from or where Im going.Well dont bother yourself just now. Lets eat I guess you are hungry and I know I am.Then the king gave orders and some of the other snakes brought the finest fruits and they ate and drank and conversed.When the repast was ended the king desired to hear Hasseeboos story so he told him all that had happened and then asked to hear the story of his host.Well said the king of the snakes mine is rather a long story but you shall hear it. A long time ago I left this place to go and live in the mountains of Al Kaaf for the change of air. One day I saw a stranger coming along and I said to him Where are you from and he said I am wandering in the wilderness. Whose son are you I asked. My name is Bolookeea. My father was a sultan and when he died I opened a small chest inside of which I found a bag which contained a small brass box when I had opened this I found some writing tied up in a woolen cloth and it was all in praise of a prophet. He was described as such a good and wonderful man that I longed to see him but when I made inquiries concerning him I was told he was not yet born. Then I vowed I would wander until I should see him. So I left our town and all my property and I am wandering but I have not yet seen that prophet.Then I said to him Where do you expect to find him if hes not yet born Perhaps if you had some serpents water you might keep on living until you find him. But its of no use talking about that the serpents water is too far away.Well he said goodbye. I must wander on. So I bade him farewell and he went his way.Now when that man had wandered until he reached Egypt he met another man who asked him Who are youI am Bolookeea. Who are youMy name is Al Faan. Where are you goingI have left my home and my property and I am seeking the prophet.Hm said Al Faan I can tell you of a better occupation than looking for a man that is not born yet. Let us go and find the king of the snakes and get him to give us a charm medicine then we will go to King Solomon and get his rings and we shall be able to make slaves of the genii and order them to do whatever we wish.And Bolookeea said I have seen the king of the snakes in the mountain of Al Kaaf.All right said Al Faan lets go.Now Al Faan wanted the ring of Solomon that he might be a great magician and control the genii and the birds while all Bolookeea wanted was to see the great prophet. As they went along Al Faan said to Bolookeea Let us make a cage and entice the king of the snakes into it then we will shut the door and carry him off.All right said Bolookeea.So they made a cage and put therein a cup of milk and a cup of wine and brought it to Al Kaaf and I like a fool went in drank up all the wine and became drunk. Then they fastened the door and took me away with them.When I came to my senses I found myself in the cage and Bolookeea carrying me and I said The sons of Adam are no good. What do you want from me And they answered We want some medicine to put on our feet so that we may walk upon the water whenever it is necessary in the course of our journey. Well said I go along.We went on until we came to a place where there were a great number and variety of trees and when those trees saw me they said I am medicine for this I am medicine for that I am medicine for the head I am medicine for the feet and presently one tree said If any one puts my medicine upon his feet he can walk on water.When I told that to those men they said That is what we want and they took a great deal of it.Then they took me back to the mountain and set me free and we said goodbye and parted.When they left me they went on their way until they reached the sea when they put the medicine on their feet and walked over. Thus they went many days until they came near to the place of King Solomon where they waited while Al Faan prepared his medicines.When they arrived at King Solomons place he was sleeping and was being watched by genii and his hand lay on his chest with the ring on his finger. As Bolookeea drew near one of the genii said to him Where are you going And he answered Im here with Al Faan hes going to take that ring. Go back said the genie keep out of the way. That man is going to die.When Al Faan had finished his preparations he said to Bolookeea Wait here for me. Then he went forward to take the ring when a great cry arose and he was thrown by some unseen force a considerable distance.Picking himself up and still believing in the power of his medicines he approached the ring again when a strong breath blew upon him and he was burnt to ashes in a moment.While Bolookeea was looking at all this a voice said Go your way this wretched being is dead. So he returned and when he got to the sea again he put the medicine upon his feet and passed over and continued to wander for many years. One morning he saw a man sitting down and said Goodmorning to which the man replied. Then Bolookeea asked him Who are you and he answered My name is Jan Shah. Who are you So Bolookeea told him who he was and asked him to tell him his history. The man who was weeping and smiling by turns insisted upon hearing Bolookeeas story first. After he had heard it he saidWell sit down and Ill tell you my story from beginning to end. My name is Jan Shah and my father is Tooeeghamus a great sultan. He used to go every day into the forest to shoot game so one day I said to him Father let me go with you into the forest today but he said Stay at home. You are better there. Then I cried bitterly and as I was his only child whom he loved dearly he couldnt stand my tears so he said Very well you shall go. Dont cry.Thus we went to the forest and took many attendants with us and when we reached the place we ate and drank and then every one set out to hunt.I and my seven slaves went on until we saw a beautiful gazelle which we chased as far as the sea without capturing it. When the gazelle took to the water I and four of my slaves took a boat the other three returning to my father and we chased that gazelle until we lost sight of the shore but we caught it and killed it. Just then a great wind began to blow and we lost our way.When the other three slaves came to my father he asked them Where is your master and they told him about the gazelle and the boat. Then he cried My son is lost My son is lost and returned to the town and mourned for me as one dead.After a time we came to an island where there were a great many birds. We found fruit and water we ate and drank and at night we climbed into a tree and slept till morning.Then we rowed to a second island and seeing no one around we gathered fruit ate and drank and climbed a tree as before. During the night we heard many savage beasts howling and roaring near us.In the morning we got away as soon as possible and came to a third island. Looking around for food we saw a tree full of fruit like redstreaked apples but as we were about to pick some we heard a voice say Dont touch this tree it belongs to the king. Toward night a number of monkeys came who seemed much pleased to see us and they brought us all the fruit we could eat.Presently I heard one of them say Let us make this man our sultan. Then another one said Whats the use Theyll all run away in the morning. But a third one said Not if we smash their boat. Sure enough when we started to leave in the morning our boat was broken in pieces. So there was nothing for it but to stay there and be entertained by the monkeys who seemed to like us very much.One day while strolling about I came upon a great stone house having an inscription on the door which said When any man comes to this island he will find it difficult to leave because the monkeys desire to have a man for their king. If he looks for a way to escape he will think there is none but there is one outlet which lies to the north. If you go in that direction you will come to a great plain which is infested with lions leopards and snakes. You must fight all of them and if you overcome them you can go forward. You will then come to another great plain inhabited by ants as big as dogs their teeth are like those of dogs and they are very fierce. You must fight these also and if you overcome them the rest of the way is clear.I consulted with my attendants over this information and we came to the conclusion that as we could only die anyhow we might as well risk death to gain our freedom.As we all had weapons we set forth and when we came to the first plain we fought and two of my slaves were killed. Then we went on to the second plain fought again my other two slaves were killed and I alone escaped.After that I wandered on for many days living on whatever I could find until at last I came to a town where I stayed for some time looking for employment but finding none.One day a man came up to me and said Are you looking for work I am said I. Come with me then said he and we went to his house.When we got there he produced a camels skin and said I shall put you in this skin and a great bird will carry you to the top of yonder mountain. When he gets you there he will tear this skin off you. You must then drive him away and push down the precious stones you will find there. When they are all down I will get you down.So he put me in the skin the bird carried me to the top of the mountain and was about to eat me when I jumped up scared him away and then pushed down many precious stones. Then I called out to the man to take me down but he never answered me and went away.I gave myself up for a dead man but went wandering about until at last after passing many days in a great forest I came to a house all by itself the old man who lived in it gave me food and drink and I was revived.I remained there a long time and that old man loved me as if I were his own son.One day he went away and giving me the keys told me I could open the door of every room except one which he pointed out to me.Of course when he was gone this was the first door I opened. I saw a large garden through which a stream flowed. Just then three birds came and alighted by the side of the stream. Immediately they changed to three most beautiful women. When they had finished bathing they put on their clothes and as I stood watching them they changed into birds again and flew away.I locked the door and went away but my appetite was gone and I wandered about aimlessly. When the old man came back he saw there was something wrong with me and asked me what was the matter. Then I told him I had seen those beautiful maidens that I loved one of them very much and that if I could not marry her I should die.The old man told me I could not possibly have my wish. He said the three lovely beings were the daughters of the sultan of the genii and that their home was a journey of three years from where we then were.I told him I couldnt help that. He must get her for my wife or I should die. At last he said Well wait till they come again then hide yourself and steal the clothes of the one you love so dearly.So I waited and when they came again I stole the clothes of the youngest whose name was Sayadaatee Shems.When they came out of the water this one could not find her clothes. Then I stepped forward and said I have them. Ah she begged give them to me their owner I want to go away. But I said to her I love you very much. I want to marry you. I want to go to my father she replied. You cannot go said I.Then her sisters flew away and I took her into the house where the old man married us. He told me not to give her those clothes I had taken but to hide them because if she ever got them she would fly away to her old home. So I dug a hole in the ground and buried them.But one day when I was away from home she dug them up and put them on then saying to the slave I had given her for an attendant When your master returns tell him I have gone home if he really loves me he will follow me she flew away.When I came home they told me this and I wandered searching for her many years. At last I came to a town where one asked me Who are you and I answered I am Jan Shah. What was your fathers name Taaeeghamus. Are you the man who married our mistress Who is your mistress Sayadaatee Shems. I am he I cried with delight.They took me to their mistress and she brought me to her father and told him I was her husband and everybody was happy.Then we thought we should like to visit our old home and her fathers genii carried us there in three days. We stayed there a year and then returned but in a short time my wife died. Her father tried to comfort me and wanted me to marry another of his daughters but I refused to be comforted and have mourned to this day. That is my story.Then Bolookeea went on his way and wandered till he died.Next Sultaanee Waa Neeoka said to Hasseeboo Now when you go home you will do me injury.Hasseeboo was very indignant at the idea and said I could not be induced to do you an injury. Pray send me home.I will send you home said the king but I am sure that you will come back and kill me.Why I dare not be so ungrateful exclaimed Hasseeboo. I swear I could not hurt you.Well said the king of the snakes bear this in mind when you go home do not go to bathe where there are many people.And he said I will remember. So the king sent him home and he went to his mothers house and she was overjoyed to find that he was not dead.Now the sultan of the town was very sick and it was decided that the only thing that could cure him would be to kill the king of the snakes boil him and give the soup to the sultan. For a reason known only to himself the vizir had placed men at the public baths with this instruction If any one who comes to bathe here has a mark on his stomach seize him and bring him to me.When Hasseeboo had been home three days he forgot the warning of Sultaanee Waa Neeoka and went to bathe with the other people. All of a sudden he was seized by some soldiers and brought before the vizir who said Take us to the home of the king of the snakes.I dont know where it is said Hasseeboo.Tie him up commanded the vizir.So they tied him up and beat him until his back was all raw and being unable to stand the pain he cried Let up I will show you the place.So he led them to the house of the king of the snakes who when he saw him said Didnt I tell you you would come back to kill meHow could I help it cried Hasseeboo. Look at my backWho has beaten you so dreadfully asked the king.The vizir.Then theres no hope for me. But you must carry me yourself.As they went along the king said to Hasseeboo When we get to your town I shall be killed and cooked. The first skimming the vizir will offer to you but dont you drink it put it in a bottle and keep it. The second skimming you must drink and you will become a great physician. The third skimming is the medicine that will cure your sultan. When the vizir asks you if you drank that first skimming say I did. Then produce the bottle containing the first and say This is the second and it is for you. The vizir will take it and as soon as he drinks it he will die and both of us will have our revenge.Everything happened as the king had said. The vizir died the sultan recovered and Hasseeboo was loved by all as a great physician.
The children in their little sheepskin coats and high felt boots and fur hats trudged along the forest path in the snow. Vanya went first then Maroosia and then old Peter. The ground was white and the snow was hard and crisp and all over the forest could be heard the crackling of the frost. And as they walked old Peter told them the story of the old woman who wanted Frost to marry her daughters.Once upon a time there were an old man and an old woman. Now the old woman was the old mans second wife. His first wife had died and had left him with a little daughter Martha she was called. Then he married again and God gave him a cross wife and with her two more daughters and they were very different from the first.The old woman loved her own daughters and gave them red kisel jelly every day and honey too as much as they could put into their greedy little mouths. But poor little Martha the eldest she got only what the others left. When they were cross they threw away what they left and then she got nothing at all.The children grew older and the stepmother made Martha do all the work of the house. She had to fetch the wood for the stove and light it and keep it burning. She had to draw the water for her sisters to wash their hands in. She had to make the clothes and wash them and mend them. She had to cook the dinner and clean the dishes after the others had done before having a bite for herself.For all that the stepmother was never satisfied and was for ever shouting at her Look the kettle is in the wrong place There is dust on the floor There is a spot on the tablecloth or The spoons are not clean you stupid ugly idle hussy. But Martha was not idle. She worked all day long and got up before the sun while her sisters never stirred from their beds till it was time for dinner. And she was not stupid. She always had a song on her lips except when her stepmother had beaten her. And as for being ugly she was the prettiest little girl in the village.Her father saw all this but he could not do anything for the old woman was mistress at home and he was terribly afraid of her. And as for the daughters they saw how their mother treated Martha and they did the same. They were always complaining and getting her into trouble. It was a pleasure to them to see the tears on her pretty cheeks.Well time went on and the little girl grew up and the daughters of the stepmother were as ugly as could be. Their eyes were always cross and their mouths were always complaining. Their mother saw that no one would want to marry either of them while there was Martha about the house with her bright eyes and her songs and her kindness to everybody.So she thought of a way to get rid of her stepdaughter and a cruel way it was.See here old man says she it is high time Martha was married and I have a bridegroom in mind for her. Tomorrow morning you must harness the old mare to the sledge and put a bit of food together and be ready to start early as Id like to see you back before night.To Martha she said Tomorrow you must pack your things in a box and put on your best dress to show yourself to your betrothed.Who is he asked Martha with red cheeks.You will know when you see him said the stepmother.All that night Martha hardly slept. She could hardly believe that she was really going to escape from the old woman at last and have a hut of her own where there would be no one to scold her. She wondered who the young man was. She hoped he was Fedor Ivanovitch who had such kind eyes and such nimble fingers on the balalaika and such a merry way of flinging out his heels when he danced the Russian dance. But although he always smiled at her when they met she felt she hardly dared to hope that it was he. Early in the morning she got up and said her prayers to God put the whole hut in order and packed her things into a little box. That was easy because she had such few things. It was the other daughters who had new dresses. Any old thing was good enough for Martha. But she put on her best blue dress and there she was as pretty a little maid as ever walked under the birch trees in spring.The old man harnessed the mare to the sledge and brought it to the door. The snow was very deep and frozen hard and the wind peeled the skin from his ears before he covered them with the flaps of his fur hat.Sit down at the table and have a bite before you go says the old woman.The old man sat down and his daughter with him and drank a glass of tea and ate some black bread. And the old woman put some cabbage soup left from the day before in a saucer and said to Martha Eat this my little pigeon and get ready for the road. But when she said my little pigeon she did not smile with her eyes but only with her cruel mouth and Martha was afraid. The old woman whispered to the old man I have a word for you old fellow. You will take Martha to her betrothed and Ill tell you the way. You go straight along and then take the road to the right into the forest  you know  straight to the big fir tree that stands on a hillock and there you will give Martha to her betrothed and leave her. He will be waiting for her and his name is Frost.The old man stared opened his mouth and stopped eating. The little maid who had heard the last words began to cryNow what are you whimpering about screamed the old woman. Frost is a rich bridegroom and a handsome one. See how much he owns. All the pines and firs are his and the birch trees. Any one would envy his possessions and he himself is a very bogatir a man of strength and power.The old man trembled and said nothing in reply. And Martha went on crying quietly though she tried to stop her tears. The old man packed up what was left of the black bread told Martha to put on her sheepskin coat set her in the sledge and climbed in and drove off along the white frozen road.The road was long and the country open and the wind grew colder and colder while the frozen snow blew up from under the hoofs of the mare and spattered the sledge with white patches. The tale is soon told but it takes time to happen and the sledge was white all over long before they turned off into the forest.They came in the end deep into the forest and left the road and over the deep snow through the trees to the great fir. There the old man stopped told his daughter to get out of the sledge set her little box under the fir and said Wait here for your bridegroom and when he comes be sure to receive him with kind words. Then he turned the mare round and drove home with the tears running from his eyes and freezing on his cheeks before they had had time to reach his beard.The little maid sat and trembled. Her sheepskin coat was worn through and in her blue bridal dress she sat while fits of shivering shook her whole body. She wanted to run away but she had not strength to move or even to keep her little white teeth from chattering between her frozen lips.Suddenly not far away she heard Frost crackling among the fir trees just as he is crackling now. He was leaping from tree to tree crackling as he came.He leapt at last into the great fir tree under which the little maid was sitting. He crackled in the top of the tree and then called down out of the topmost branchesAre you warm little maidWarm warm little Father Frost.Frost laughed and came a little lower in the tree and crackled and crackled louder than before. Then he askedAre you still warm little maid Are you warm little red cheeksThe little maid could hardly speak. She was nearly dead but she answeredWarm dear Frost warm little father.Frost climbed lower in the tree and crackled louder than ever and askedAre you still warm little maid Are you warm little red cheeks Are you warm little pawsThe little maid was benumbed all over but she whispered so that Frost could just hear herWarm little pigeon warm dear FrostAnd Frost was sorry for her leapt down with a tremendous crackle and a scattering of frozen snow wrapped the little maid up in rich furs and covered her with warm blankets.In the morning the old woman said to her husband Drive off now to the forest and wake the young couple.The old man wept when he thought of his little daughter for he was sure that he would find her dead. He harnessed the mare and drove off through the snow. He came to the tree and heard his little daughter singing merrily while Frost crackled and laughed. There she was alive and warm with a good fur cloak about her shoulders a rich veil costly blankets round her feet and a box full of splendid presents.The old man did not say a word. He was too surprised. He just sat in the sledge staring while the little maid lifted her box and the box of presents set them in the sledge climbed in and sat down beside him.They came home and the little maid Martha fell at the feet of her stepmother. The old woman nearly went off her head with rage when she saw her alive with her fur cloak and rich veil and the box of splendid presents fit for the daughter of a prince.Ah you slut she cried you wont get round me like thatAnd she would not say another word to the little maid but went about all day long biting her nails and thinking what to do.At night she said to the old manYou must take my daughters too to that bridegroom in the forest. He will give them better gifts than these.Things take time to happen but the tale is quickly told. Early next morning the old woman woke her daughters fed them with good food dressed them like brides hustled the old man made him put clean hay in the sledge and warm blankets and sent them off to the forest.The old man did as he was biddrove to the big fir tree set the boxes under the tree lifted out the stepdaughters and set them on the boxes side by side and drove back home.They were warmly dressed these two and well fed and at first as they sat there they did not think about the cold.I cant think what put it into mothers head to marry us both at once said the first and to send us here to be married. As if there were not enough young men in the village. Who can tell what sort of fellows we shall meet hereThen they began to quarrel.Well says one of them Im beginning to get the cold shivers. If our fated ones do not come soon we shall perish of cold.Its a flat lie to say that bridegrooms get ready early. Its already dinnertime.What if only one comesYoull have to come another time.You think hell look at youWell he wont take you anyhow.Of course hell take me.Take you first Its enough to make any one laughThey began to fight and scratch each other so that their cloaks fell open and the cold entered their bosoms.Frost crackling among the trees laughing to himself froze the hands of the two quarrelling girls and they hid their hands in the sleeves of their fur coats and shivered and went on scolding and jeering at each other.Oh you ugly mug dirty nose What sort of a housekeeper will you makeAnd what about you boasting one You know nothing but how to gad about and lick your own face. Well soon see which of us hell take.And the two girls went on wrangling and wrangling till they began to freeze in good earnest.Suddenly they cried out togetherDevil take these bridegrooms for being so long in coming You have turned blue all over.And together they replied shiveringNo bluer than yourself toothchatterer.And Frost not so far away crackled and laughed and leapt from fir tree to fir tree crackling as he came.The girls heard that some one was coming through the forest.Listen theres some one coming. Yes and with bells on his sledgeShut up you slut I cant hear and the frost is taking the skin off me.They began blowing on their fingers.And Frost came nearer and nearer crackling laughing talking to himself just as he is doing today. Nearer and nearer he came leaping from treetop to treetop till at last he leapt into the great fir under which the two girls were sitting and quarrelling.He leant down looking through the branches and askedAre you warm maidens Are you warm little red cheeks Are you warm little pigeonsUgh Frost the cold is hurting us. We are frozen. We are waiting for our bridegrooms but the cursed fellows have not turned up.Frost came a little lower in the tree and crackled louder and swifter.Are you warm maidens Are you warm my little red cheeksGo to the devil they cried out. Are you blind Our hands and feet are frozenFrost came still lower in the branches and cracked and crackled louder than ever.Are you warm maidens he asked.Into the pit with you with all the fiends the girls screamed at him you ugly wretched fellow And as they were cursing at him their bad words died on their lips for the two girls the cross children of the cruel stepmother were frozen stiff where they sat.Frost hung from the lowest branches of the tree swaying and crackling while he looked at the anger frozen on their faces. Then he climbed swiftly up again and crackling and cracking chuckling to himself he went off leaping from fir tree to fir tree this way and that through the white frozen forest.In the morning the old woman says to her husbandNow then old man harness the mare to the sledge and put new hay in the sledge to be warm for my little ones and lay fresh rushes on the hay to be soft for them and take warm rugs with you for maybe they will be cold even in their furs. And look sharp about it and dont keep them waiting. The frost is hard this morning and it was harder in the night.The old man had not time to eat even a mouthful of black bread before she had driven him out into the snow. He put hay and rushes and soft blankets in the sledge and harnessed the mare and went off to the forest. He came to the great fir and found the two girls sitting under it dead with their anger still to be seen on their frozen ugly faces.He picked them up first one and then the other and put them in the rushes and the warm hay covered them with the blankets and drove home.The old woman saw him coming far away over the shining snow. She ran to meet him and shouted outWhere are the little onesIn the sledge.She snatched off the blankets and pulled aside the rushes and found the bodies of her two cross daughters.Instantly she flew at the old man in a storm of rage. What have you done to my children my little red cherries my little pigeons I will kill you with the oven fork I will break your head with the pokerThe old man listened till she was out of breath and could not say another word. That my dears is the only wise thing to do when a woman is in a scolding rage. And as soon as she had no breath left with which to answer him he saidMy little daughter got riches for soft words but yours were always rough of the tongue. And its not my fault anyhow for you yourself sent them into the forest.Well at last the old woman got her breath again and scolded away till she was tired out. But in the end she made her peace with the old man and they lived together as quietly as could be expected.As for Martha Fedor Ivanovitch sought her in marriage as he had meant to do all alongyes and married her and pretty she looked in the furs that Frost had given her. I was at the feast and drank beer and mead with the rest. And she had the prettiest children that ever were seenyes and the best behaved. For if ever they thought of being naughty the old grandfather told them the story of crackling Frost and how kind words won kindness and cross words cold treatment. And now listen to Frost. Hear how he crackles away And mind if ever he asks you if you are warm be as polite to him as you can. And to do that the best way is to be good always like little Martha. Then it comes easy.The children listened and laughed quietly because they knew they were good. Away in the forest they heard Frost and thought of him crackling and leaping from one tree to another. And just then they came home. It was dusk for dusk comes early in winter and a little way through the trees before them they saw the lamp of their hut glittering on the snow. The big dog barked and ran forward and the children with him. The soup was warm on the stove and in a few minutes they were sitting at the table Vanya Maroosia and old Peter blowing at their steaming spoons.
The king of animals with royal graceWould celebrate his birthday in the chase.Twas not with bow and arrowsTo slay some wretched sparrowsThe lion hunts the wild boar of the woodThe antlered deer and stags the fat and good.This time the king t insure successTook for his aidedecamp an assA creature of stentorian voiceThat felt much honourd by the choice.The lion hid him in a proper stationAnd orderd him to bray for his vocationAssured that his tempestuous cryThe boldest beasts would terrifyAnd cause them from their lairs to fly.And sooth the horrid noise the creature madeDid strike the tenants of the wood with dreadAnd as they headlong fledAll fell within the lions ambuscade.Has not my service gloriousMade both of us victoriousCried out the muchelated ass.Yes said the lion bravely braydHad I not known yourself and raceI should have been myself afraidThe donkey had he daredWith anger would have flaredAt this retort though justly madeFor who could suffer boasts to passSo illbefitting to an ass
There was once a poor woman who had twin daughters. The girls were exactly alike in face and feature but utterly different in disposition. Dobrunka was kind industrious obedient and everything a good girl ought to be. Zloboha her sister was spiteful disobedient lazy and proud. In fact she had just about as many faults as a person could have. Yet strange to say the mother loved Zloboha much better and made everything easy for her.The girls were exactly alike in face and feature but utterly different in disposition. Illustration by Jan Matulka published in Czechoslovak Fairy Tales by Parker Fillmore 1919 Harcourt Brace and Company.They lived in a cottage a few miles from town. The cottage stood by itself in a little clearing in the woods. Hardly any one ever passed it except occasionally some man who had lost his way in the woods.The mother put her favorite Zloboha out to service so that she might learn city ways but she kept Dobrunka at home to do the housework and take care of the garden. Dobrunka always began the day by feeding the goats then she prepared the breakfast swept the kitchen and when everything else was done she sat down at her spinning wheel and spun.She seldom benefited from the yarn she spun so carefully for her mother always sold it in town and spent the money on clothes for Zloboha. Yet Dobrunka loved her mother although she never had a kind word or a kind look from her the whole day long. She always obeyed her mother instantly and without a frown and no one ever heard her complain about all the work she had to do.One day when her mother was going to town Dobrunka went part of the way with her carrying her yarn wrapped up in a kerchief.Now see that youre not lazy while Im away her mother said crossly.You know mother you never have to nag at me. Today when I finish the housework Ill spin so industriously that youll be more than satisfied when you get home.She handed her yarn to her mother and went back to the cottage. Then when she had put the kitchen in order she sat down to her wheel and began to spin. Dobrunka had a pretty voice as pretty as any of the songbirds in the forest and always when she was alone she sang. So today as she sat spinning she sang all the songs she knew one after the other.Suddenly she heard outside the trample of a horse. Some one is coming she thought to herself someone who has lost his way in the woods. Ill go see.She got up from her wheel and peeped out through the small window. A young man was just dismounting from a spirited horse.Oh thought Dobrunka to herself what a handsome young lord he is How well his leather coat fits him How well his cap with its white feather looks on his black hair Ah he is tying his horse and is coming in. I must slip back to my spinning.The next moment the young man opened the door and stepped into the kitchen. All this happened a long time ago you see when there were no locks or bars on the doors and there didnt have to be because nothing was ever stolen.Good day to you my girl the young man said to Dobrunka.Good day sir Dobrunka answered. What is it sir you wantWill you please get me a little water. Im very thirsty.Certainly Dobrunka said. Wont you sit down while Im getting itShe ran off got the pitcher rinsed it out and drew some fresh water from the well.I wish I could give you something better sir.Nothing could taste better than this he said handing her back the empty pitcher. See I have taken it all.Dobrunka put the pitcher away and the young man while her back was turned slipped a leather bag full of money into the bed.I thank you for the drink he said as he rose to go. Ill come again tomorrow if youll let me.Come if you want to Dobrunka said modestly.He took her hand held it a moment then leaped upon his horse and galloped off.Dobrunka sat down again to her wheel and tried to work but her mind wandered. The image of the young man kept rising before her eyes and I have to confess that for an expert spinner she broke her thread pretty often.Her mother came home in the evening full of praises of Zloboha who she said was growing prettier day by day. Everybody in town admired her and she was fast learning city ways and city manners. It was Zloboha this and Zloboha that for hours.Finally the old woman remarked They say there was a great hunting party out today. Did you hear anything of itOh yes Dobrunka said. I forgot to tell you that a young huntsman stopped here to ask for a drink. He was handsomely dressed in leather. You know once when I was in town with you we saw a whole company of men in leather coats with white feathers in their caps. No doubt this young man belonged to the hunting party. When he had his drink he jumped on his horse and rode off.Dobrunka forgot to mention that he had taken her hand in parting and promised to come back next day.When Dobrunka was preparing the bed for the night the bag of money fell out. In great surprise she picked it up and handed it to her mother.The old woman looked at her sharply.Dobrunka who gave you all this moneyNobody gave it to me mother. Perhaps the huntsman slipped it into the bed. I dont know where else it could have come from.The old woman emptied the bag on the table. They were all gold pieces.Good heavens so much she murmured in amazement. He must be a very rich young lord Perhaps he saw how poor we were and thought to do a kind deed. May God grant him happinessShe gathered the money together and hid it in the chest.Usually when Dobrunka went to bed after her days work she fell asleep at once but tonight she lay awake thinking of the handsome young rider. When she did at last fall asleep it was to dream of him. He was a powerful young lord it seemed to her in her dream. He lived in a great palace and she Dobrunka was his wife. She thought that they were giving a fine banquet to which all the nobles in the land had been invited. She and her husband arose from the table and went together into another room. He was about to put his arms about her and embrace her when suddenly a black cat sprang between them and buried its claws in Dobrunkas breast. Her hearts blood spurted out and stained her white dress. She cried out in fright and pain and the cry awoke her.What a strange dream she thought to herself. I wonder what it means. It began so beautifully but the cruel cat spoiled it all. I fear it bodes something ill.In the morning when she got up she was still thinking of it.On other mornings it didnt take Dobrunka long to dress but this morning she was very slow. She shook out her fresh skirt again and again. She had the greatest trouble in putting on her bodice just right. She spent much time on her hair into which she plaited the red ribbon that she usually kept for holidays. When at last she was dressed and ready to go about her household duties she looked very fresh and sweet.As midday came she found it hard to sit still at her wheel but kept jumping up on any pretext whatever to run outdoors a moment to see if the young horseman was in sight.At last she did see him at a distance and oh how she hurried back to her stool so that he would never think that she was watching for him.He rode into the yard tied his horse and came into the cottage.Good day Dobrunka he said speaking very gently and very respectfully.Dobrunkas heart was beating so fast that she feared it would jump out of her body. Her mother was in the woods gathering fagots so she was again alone with him. She managed to return his greeting and to ask him to sit down. Then she went back to her spinning.The young man came over to her and took her hand.How did you sleep DobrunkaVery well sir.Did you dreamYes I had a very strange dream.Tell me about it. I can explain dreams very well.But I cant tell this dream to you Dobrunka said.Because its about you.Thats the very reason you ought to tell me the young man said.He urged her and begged her until at last Dobrunka did tell him the dream.Well now he said that dream of yours except the part about the cat can be realized easily enough.Dobrunka laughed. How could I ever become a fine ladyBy marrying me the young man said.Dobrunka blushed. Now sir you are joking.No Dobrunka this is no joke. I really mean it. I came back this morning to ask you to marry me. Will youDobrunka was too surprised to speak but when the young man took her hand she did not withdraw it.Just then the old woman came in. The young man greeted her and without any delay declared his intentions. He said he loved Dobrunka and wished to make her his wife and that all he and Dobrunka were waiting for was the mothers consent.I have my own house he added and am well able to take care of a wife. And for you too dear mother there will always be room in my house and at my table.The old woman listened to all he had to say and then very promptly gave her blessing.Then my dear one the young man said to Dobrunka go back to your spinning and when you have spun enough for your wedding shift I shall come for you.He kissed her gave his hand to her mother and springing on his horse rode away.From that time the old woman treated Dobrunka more kindly. She even went so far as to spend on Dobrunka a little of the money the young man had given them but most of it of course went for clothes for Zloboha.But in those happy days Dobrunka wasnt worrying about anything as unimportant as money. She sat at her wheel and spun away thinking all the while of her fine young lover. Time sped quickly and before she knew it she had spun enough for her wedding shift.The very day she was finished her lover came. She heard the trample of his horse and ran out to meet him.Have you spun enough for your wedding shift he asked her as he took her to his heart.Yes Dobrunka said I have.Then you can ride away with me this moment.This moment Dobrunka gasped. Why so quicklyIt has to be my dear one. Tomorrow I go off to war and want you to take my place at home. Then when I come back youll be there to greet me as my wife.But what will my mother say to thisShe will have to consent.They went into the cottage and spoke to the old woman. She was far from pleased with this arrangement for she had worked out a very different plan in her mind. But what could she do A rich young bridegroom always has his own way. So she hid her disappointment with a false smile and gave them her blessing.Then the young man said to her Get your things together mother and follow Dobrunka for I dont want her to be lonely while Im gone. When you get to the city go to the palace and ask for Dobromil. The people there will tell you where to go.Dobrunka with tears streaming down her cheeks bid her mother goodby. Dobromil lifted her to the saddle in front of him and away they went like the wind.The town was in great excitement. There was much hurrying to and fro as the troops were being put in readiness for the morrow. A crowd had gathered at the palace gates and as a young man came galloping up holding in front of him a lady lovely as the day the shout went upHere he is Here he isThe people in the courtyard took up the cry and as Dobromil rode through the gate all of them with one voice shouted outLong live our beautiful queen Long live our noble kingDobrunka was struck with amazement.Are you really the king Dobromil she asked looking into his proud and happy face.Yes he said. Arent you glad that I amI love you Dobrunka said and so whatever you are makes no difference to me. But why did you deceive meI did not deceive you. I told you that your dream would be realized if you took me for your husband.In those early times marriage was a simple affair. When a man and woman loved each other and their parents consented to their union they were looked upon as married. So Dobromil now was able to present Dobrunka to his people as his wife.There was great rejoicing music played and there was feasting and drinking in the banquet hall until dawn. The next day the young husband kissed his lovely bride farewell and rode off to war.Left alone the young queen strayed through the magnificent palace like a lost lamb. She would have felt more at home rambling through the woods and awaiting the return of her husband in a little cottage than here where she was a lonely stranger. Yet she was not a stranger long for within half a day she had won every heart by her sweetness and goodness.The next day she sent for her mother and the old woman soon arrived bringing with her Dobrunkas spinning wheel. So now there was no more excuse for loneliness.Dobrunka supposed that her mother would be made very happy to find what good fortune had befallen her daughter. The old woman pretended she was but in her heart she was furious that a king had married Dobrunka and not Zloboha.After a few days she said very artfully to Dobrunka I know my dear daughter that you think your sister Zloboha was not always kind to you in times past. Shes sorry now and I want you to forgive her and invite her here to the palace.I should have asked her before this said Dobrunka but I didnt suppose she wanted to come. If you wish it well go for her at once.Yes dear daughter I do wish it.So the queen ordered the carriage and off they went to fetch Zloboha. When they came to the edge of the woods they alighted and ordered the coachman to await them there. They went on afoot to the cottage where Zloboha was expecting them.Zloboha came running out to meet them. She threw her arms about her sisters neck and kissed her and wished her happiness. Then the wicked sister and the wicked mother led poor unsuspecting Dobrunka into the house. Once inside Zloboha took a knife that she had ready and struck Dobrunka. Then they cut off Dobrunkas hands and feet gouged out her eyes and hid her poor mutilated body in the woods. Zloboha and her mother wrapped up the hands and the feet and the eyes to carry them back with them to the palace because they believed that it would be easier for them to deceive the king if they had with them something that had belonged to Dobrunka.Then Zloboha put on Dobrunkas clothes and she and her mother rode back to town in the carriage and nobody could tell that she wasnt Dobrunka. In the palace the attendants soon whispered to each other that their mistress was kinder to them at first but they suspected nothing.In the meantime poor Dobrunka who was not quite dead had been found by a hermit and carried by him to a cave. She awoke to feel a kind hand soothing her wounds and putting some reviving drops between her lips. Of course she could not see who it was for she had no eyes. As she regained consciousness she remembered what had happened and began bitterly to upbraid her unnatural mother and her cruel sister.Be quiet. Do not complain a low voice said. All will yet be well.How can all be well wept poor Dobrunka when I have no eyes and no feet and no hands I shall never again see the bright sun and the green woods. I shall never again hold in my arms my beloved Dobromil. Nor shall I be able to spin fine flax for his shirts Oh what did I ever do to you wicked mother or to you cruel sister that you have done this to meThe hermit went to the entrance of the cave and called three times. Soon a boy came running in answer to the call.Wait here till I come back the hermit said.He returned in a short time with a golden spinning wheel in his arms. He said to the boyMy son take this spinning wheel to town to the kings palace. Sit down in the courtyard near the gate and if any one asks you for how much you will sell the wheel say For two eyes. Unless you are offered two eyes for it bring it back.The boy took the spinning wheel and carried it to town as the hermit directed. He went to the palace and sat down in the courtyard near the gate just as Zloboha and her mother were returning from a walk.Look mother Zloboha cried. What a gorgeous spinning wheel I could spin on that myself Wait. Ill ask whether its for sale.She went over to the boy and asked him would he sell the spinning wheel.Yes he said if I get what I want.What do you wantI want two eyes.Two eyesYes two eyes. My father told me to accept nothing for it but two eyes. So I cant sell it for money.The longer Zloboha looked at the spinning wheel the more beautiful it seemed to her and the more she wanted it. Suddenly she remembered Dobrunkas eyes that she had hidden away.Mother she said as a queen I ought to have something no one else has. When the king comes home he will want me to spin and just think how lovely I should look sitting at this golden wheel. Now weve got those eyes of Dobrunkas. Let us exchange them for the golden spinning wheel. Well still have the hands and feet.The mother who was as foolish as the daughter agreed. So Zloboha got the eyes and gave them to the boy for the spinning wheel.The boy hurried back to the forest and handed the eyes to the hermit. The old man took them and gently put them into place. Instantly Dobrunka could see.The first thing she saw was the old hermit himself with his tall spare figure and long white beard. The last rays of the setting sun shone through the opening of the cave and lighted up his grave and gentle face. He looked to Dobrunka like one of Gods own saints.How can I ever repay you she said for all your loving kindness Oh that I could cover your hands with kissesBe quiet my child the old man said. If you are patient all will yet be well.He went out and soon returned with some delicious fruit on a wooden plate. This he carried over to the bed of leaves and moss upon which Dobrunka was lying and with his own hands he fed Dobrunka as a mother would feed her helpless child. Then he gave her a drink from a wooden cup.Early the next morning the hermit again called three times and the boy came running at once. This time the hermit handed him a golden distaff and saidTake this distaff and go to the palace. Sit down in the courtyard near the gate. If any one asks you what you want for the distaff say two feet and dont exchange it for anything else.Zloboha was standing at a window of the palace looking down into the courtyard when she saw the boy with a golden distaff.Mother she cried. Come and see Theres that boy again sitting near the gate and this time he has a golden distaffMother and daughter at once went out to question the boy.What do you want for the distaff Zloboha asked.Two feet the boy said.Two feetYes two feet.Tell me what will your father do with two feetI dont know. I never ask my father what he does with anything. But whatever he tells me to do I do. That is why I cant exchange the distaff for anything but two feet.Listen mother Zloboha said now that I have a golden spinning wheel I ought to have a golden distaff to go with it. You know we have those two feet of Dobrunkas hidden away. What if I gave them to the boy We shall still have Dobrunkas hands.Well do as you please the old woman said.So Zloboha went and got Dobrunkas feet wrapped them up and gave them to the boy in exchange for the distaff. Delighted with her bargain Zloboha went to her chamber and the boy hurried back to the forest.He gave the feet to the hermit and the old man carried them at once inside the cave. Then he rubbed Dobrunkas wounds with some healing salve and stuck on the feet. Dobrunka wanted to jump up from the couch and walk but the old man restrained her.Lie quiet where you are until you are all well and then Ill let you get up.Dobrunka knew that whatever the old hermit said was for her good so she rested as he ordered.On the third morning the hermit called the boy and gave him a golden spindle.Go to the palace again he said and today offer this spindle for sale. If any one asks you what you want for the spindle say two hands. Dont accept anything else.The boy took the golden spindle and when he reached the palace and sat down in the courtyard near the gate Zloboha ran up to him at once.What do you want for that spindle she asked.Two hands the boy said.Its a strange thing you wont sell anything for money.I have to ask what my father tells me to ask.Zloboha was in a quandary. She wanted the golden spindle for it was very beautiful. It would go well with the spinning wheel and would be something to be proud of. Yet she didnt want to be left without anything that had belonged to Dobrunka.But really mother she whined I dont see why I have to keep something of Dobrunkas so that Dobromil will love me as he loved her. Im sure Im as pretty as Dobrunka ever was.Well said the old woman it would be better if you kept them. Ive often heard thats a good way to guard a mans love. However do as you like.For a moment Zloboha was undecided. Then tossing her head she ran and got the hands and gave them to the boy.Zloboha took the spindle and delighted with her bargain carried it into her chamber where she had the wheel and distaff. The old woman was a little troubled for she feared Zloboha had acted foolishly. But Zloboha confident of her beauty and her ability to charm the king only laughed at her.As soon as the boy had delivered the hands to the hermit the old man carried them into the cave. Then he anointed the wounds on Dobrunkas arms with the same healing salve that he used before and stuck on the hands.As soon as Dobrunka could move them she jumped up from the couch and falling at the hermits feet she kissed the hands that had been so good to her.A thousand thanks to you my benefactor she cried with tears of joy in her eyes. I can never repay you I know that but ask of me anything I can do and Ill do it.I ask nothing the old man said gently raising her to her feet. What I did for you I would do for any one. I only did my duty. So say no more about it. And now my child farewell. You are to stay here until some one comes for you. Have no concern for food. I shall send you what you need.Dobrunka wanted to say something to him but he disappeared and she never saw him again.Now she was able to run out of the cave and look once more upon Gods green world. Now for the first time in her life she knew what it meant to be strong and well. She threw herself on the ground and kissed it. She hugged the slender birches and danced around them simply bursting with love for every living thing. She reached out longing hands towards the town and would probably have gone there running all the distance but she remembered the words of the old hermit and knew that she must stay where she was.Meanwhile strange things were happening at the palace. Messengers brought word that the king was returning from war and there was great rejoicing on every side. The kings own household was particularly happy for service under the new mistress was growing more unpleasant every day. As for Zloboha and her mother it must be confessed that they were a little frightened over the outcome of their plot.Finally the king arrived. Zloboha with smiling face went to meet him. He took her to his heart with great tenderness and from that moment Zloboha had no fear that he would recognize her.A great feast was at once prepared for the king had brought home with him many of his nobles to rest and make merry after the hardships of war.Zloboha as she sat at Dobromils side could not take her eyes off him. The handsome young soldier caught her fancy and she was rejoiced that she had put Dobrunka out of the way.When they finished feasting Dobromil asked her What have you been doing all this time my dear Dobrunka Im sure youve been spinning.Thats true my dear husband Zloboha said in a flattering tone. My old spinning wheel got broken so I bought a new one a lovely golden one.You must show me it at once the king said and he took Zlobohas arm and led her away.He went with her to her chamber where she had the golden spinning wheel and she took it out and showed it to him. Dobromil admired it greatly.Sit down Dobrunka he said and spin. I should like to see you again at the distaff.Zloboha at once sat down behind the wheel. She put her foot to the treadle and started the wheel. Instantly the wheel sang out and this is what it sangMaster master dont believe herShes a cruel and base deceiverShe is not your own sweet wifeShe destroyed Dobrunkas lifeZloboha sat stunned and motionless while the king looked wildly about to see where the song came from.When he could see nothing he told her to spin some more. Trembling she obeyed. Hardly had she put her foot to the treadle when the voice again sang outMaster master dont believe herShes a cruel and base deceiverShe has killed her sister goodAnd hid her body in the woodBeside herself with fright Zloboha wanted to flee the spinning wheel but Dobromil restrained her. Suddenly her face grew so hideous with fear that Dobromil saw she was not his own gentle Dobrunka. With a rough hand he forced her back to the stool and in a stern voice ordered her to spin.Again she turned the fatal wheel and then for the third time the voice sang outMaster master haste awayTo the wood without delayIn a cave your wife restoredYearns for you her own true lordAt those words Dobromil released Zloboha and ran like mad out of the chamber and down into the courtyard where he ordered his swiftest horse to be saddled instantly. The attendants frightened by his appearance lost no time and almost at once Dobromil was on his horse and flying over hill and dale so fast that the horses hoofs scarcely touched the earth.When he reached the forest he did not know where to look for the cave. He rode straight into the wood until a white doe crossed his path. Then the horse in fright plunged to one side and pushed through bushes and undergrowth to the base of a big rock. Dobromil dismounted and tied the horse to a tree.He climbed the rock and there he saw something white gleaming among the trees. He crept forward cautiously and suddenly found himself in front of a cave. Imagine then his joy when he enters and finds his own dear wife Dobrunka.As he kisses her and looks into her sweet gentle face he says Where were my eyes that I was deceived for an instant by your wicked sisterWhat have you heard about my sister asked Dobrunka who as yet knew nothing of the magic spinning wheel.So the king told her all that had happened and she in turn told him what had befallen her.And from the time the hermit disappeared she said in conclusion the little boy has brought me food every day.They sat down on the grass and together they ate some fruit from the wooden plate. When they rose to go they took the wooden plate and the cup away with them as keepsakes.Dobromil seated his wife in front of him on the horse and sped homewards with her. All his people were at the palace gate waiting to tell him what had happened in his absence.It seems that the devil himself had come and before their very eyes had carried off his wife and motherinlaw. They looked at each other in amazement as Dobromil rode up with what seemed to be the same wife whom the devil had so recently carried off.Dobromil explained to them what had happened and with one voice they called down punishment on the head of the wicked sister.The golden spinning wheel had vanished. So Dobrunka hunted out her old one and set to work at once to spin for her husbands shirts. No one in the kingdom had such fine shirts as Dobromil and no one was happier.
It is related that when the Lord created the world he also made all the animals and gave each its name. He also created the ass which said Lord what is my name Your name is ass The ass went away well pleased. After a while it forgot its name and went back to the Lord. Lord what is my name Ass After a while it came back again. Excuse me Lord what is my name Ass ass The ass turned and went away but forgot it another time and came back. Lord I have forgotten my name. The Lord could not stand it any longer but seized its ears and pulled them sharply exclaiming Ass Ass Ass The ears were pulled so hard that they became long and that is why the ass has long ears and why we pull a persons ears to keep him from forgetting a thing.
Now on the first day Raja Raslu journeyed far until he came to a lonely forest where he halted for the night. And seeing it was a desolate place and the night dark he determined to set a watch. So he divided the time into three watches and the carpenter took the first the goldsmith the second and Raja Raslu the third.Then the goldsmith lad spread a couch of clean grass for his master and fearing lest the Princes heart should sink at the change from his former luxurious life he said these words of encouragement  Cradled till now on softest downGrass is thy couch tonightYet grieve not thou if Fortune frownBrave hearts heed not her slightNow when Raja Raslu and the goldsmiths son slept a snake came out of a thicket hard by and crept towards the sleepers.Who are you quoth the carpenter lad and why do you come hitherI have destroyed all things within twelve miles returned the serpent. Who are you that have dared to come hitherThen the snake attacked the carpenter and they fought until the snake was killed when the carpenter hid the dead body under his shield and said nothing of the adventure to his comrades lest he should alarm them for like the goldsmith he thought the Prince might be discouraged.Now when it came to Raja Raslus turn to keep watch a dreadful unspeakable horror came out of the thicket. Nevertheless Raslu went up to it boldly and cried aloud Who are you and what brings you hereThen the awful unspeakable horror replied I have killed everything for thrice twelve miles around Who are you that dare come hitherWhereupon Raslu drew his mighty bow and pierced the horror with anarrow so that it fled into a cave whither the Prince followed it.And they fought long and fiercely till at last the horror died andRaslu returned to watch in peace.Now when morning broke Raja Raslu called his sleeping servants and the carpenter showed with pride the body of the serpent he had killed.Tis but a small snake quoth the Raja. Come and see what I killed in the caveAnd behold when the goldsmith lad and the carpenter lad saw the awful dreadful unspeakable horror Raja Raslu had slain they were exceedingly afraid and falling on their knees begged to be allowed to return to the city saying O mighty Raslu you are a Raja and a hero You can fight such horrors we are but ordinary folk and if we follow you we shall surely be killed. Such things are nought to you but they are death to us. Let us goThen Raslu looked at them sorrowfully and bade them do as they wished saying    Aloes linger long before they flowerGracious rain too soon is overpastYouth and strength are with us but an hourAll glad life must end in death at last  But king reigns king without consent of courtierRulers may rule though none heed their command.Heavencrownd heads stoop not but rise the haughtierAlone and houseless in a strangers landSo his friends forsook him and Raslu journeyed on alone.
Outa having disposed of his nightly tot held his crooked hands towards the cheerful blaze and turned his engaging smile alternately on it and his little masters.Ach what it is to keep a bit of the Sun even when the Sun is gone Long ago Outas people the Bushmen did not know about fire. No my baasjes when the Big Fire that makes the world warm and bright walked across the sky they were happy. They hunted and danced and feasted. They shot the fine big bucks with their little poisoned arrows and they tore pieces off and ate the flesh with the red blood dripping from it they had no fire to make it dry up. And the roots and eintjes that they dug out with their sharp stonesthose too they ate just as they were. They did not cook for they did not know how to make fire. But when the white man came then they learnt. Baasjes see Outas head is bigbigger than the Baass headbut that does not help. Its the inside that matters and the white mans head inside hereOuta tapped his wrinkled foreheadAlla but it can hold a lotIn the olden days when Outas people were cold they crept into caves and covered themselves with skins for they had no fire to sit by. Yes they were sorry when the Old Man in the sky put down his arms and lay down to sleep.What Old Man asked Pietie. Do you mean the SunAja Dont baasjes then know that the Sun was once a man It was long long ago before Outas people lived in the world perhaps in the days of the Early Race that were before even the Flat Bushmen who were the first people we really know anything about. In those days at a certain place lived a man from whose armpits brightness streamed. When he lifted one arm the place on that side of him was light when he lifted the other arm the place on that side of him was light but when he lifted both arms the light shone all around about him. But it only shone around the place where he lived it did not reach to other places.Sometimes the people asked him to stand on a stone so that his light could go farther and sometimes he climbed on a kopje and lifted up his arms ach then the light streamed out far far and lighted up the veld for miles and miles. For the higher he went the farther the light shone.Then the people said We see now the higher he goes the farther his light shines. If only we could put him very high his light would go out over the whole world.So they tried to make a plan and at last a wise old woman called the young people together and said You must go to this man from whose armpits the light streams. When he is asleep you must go and the strongest of you must take him under the armpits and lift him up and swing him to and frososoand throw him as high as you can into the sky so that he may be above the kopjes lifting his arms to let the light stream down to warm the earth and make green things to grow in summer.So the young men went to the place where the man lay sleeping. Quietly they went my baasjes creeping along in the red sand so as not to wake him. He was in a deep sleep and before he could wake the strong young men took him under the armpits and swung him to and fro as the wise old woman had told them. Then as they swung him they threw him into the air high high and there he stuck.The next morning when he awoke and stretched himself lifting up his arms the light streamed out from under them and brightened all the world warming the earth and making the green things grow. And so it went on day after day. When he put up his arms it was bright it was day. When he put down one arm it was cloudy the weather was not clear. And when he put down both arms and turned over to go to sleep there was no light at all it was dark it was night. But when he awoke and lifted his arms the day came again and the world was warm and bright.Sometimes he is far away from the earth. Then it is cold it is winter. But when he comes near the earth gets warm again the green things grow and the fruit ripens it is summer. And so it goes on to this day my baasjes the day and night summer and winter and all because the Old Man with the bright armpits was thrown into the sky.But the Sun is not a man Outa said downright Willem and he hasnt any arms.No my baasje not now. He is not a man any more. But baasjes must remember how long he has been up in the skyspans and spans and spans of years always rolling round and rolling round from the time he wakes in the morning till he lies down to sleep at the other side of the world. And with the rolling baasjes he has got all rounder and rounder and the light that at first came only from under his arms has been rolled right round him till now he is a big ball of light rolling from one side of the sky to the other.Cousin Minnie who had been listening in a desultory way to the fireside chatter as she wrote at the sidetable started and leant toward the little group but a single glance was enough to show that so interested were the children in the personal aspect of the tale that there was no fear of confusion arising in their minds from Outas decided subversion of an elementary fact which she had been at some pains to get them to understand and accept.And his arms Outa inquired little Jan in his earnest way do they never come out nowOuta beamed upon him proudly. Ach that is my little master Always to ask a big thing Yes baasje sometimes they come out. When it is a dark day then he has put his arms out. He is holding them down and spreading his hands before the light so that it cant shine on the world. And sometimes just before he gets up in the morning and before he goes to sleep at night havent baasjes seen long bright stripes coming from the round ball of lightYes yes assented his little listeners eagerly.Those are the long fingers of the Sun. His arms are rolled up inside the fiery ball but he sticks his long fingers out and they make bright roads into the sky spreading out all round him. The Old Man is peeping at the earth through his fingers. Baasjes must count them next time he sticks them out and see if they are all thereeight long ones those are the fingers and two short ones for the thumbs.Outas knowledge of arithmetic was limited to the number of his crooked digits and the smile with which he announced the extent of his mathematical attainments was a ludicrous cross between proud triumph and modest reluctance.When he lies down he pulls them in. Then all the world grows dark and the people go to sleep.But Outa it isnt always dark at night Pietie reminded him. There are the Stars and the Moon you know.Ach yes The little Stars and the Lady Moon. Outa will tell the baasjes about them another night but now he must go quickquick and let Lys rub his back with buchu. When friend Old Age comes the back bends and the bones get stiff and the rheumatismfoei but it can pinch Therefore my baasjes Outa cooks bossies from the veld to rub onbuchu and kookamakranka and karroo bossies. They are all good but buchu is the best. Yes buchu for the outside and the Baass firewater for the insideHe looked longingly at the cupboard but wood and glass are unresponsive until acted on by human agency so possessing no Open Sesame for that unyielding lock Outa contented himself by smacking his lips as he toddled away.
Once upon a time there was a king who had four sons. One day the queen said to himIt is time that one of our boys went out into the world to make his fortune.I have been thinking that very same thing the king said. Let us get ready Raduz our youngest and send him off with Gods blessing.Preparations were at once made and in a few days Raduz bid his parents farewell and set forth.He traveled many days and many nights over desert plains and through dense forests until he came to a high mountain. Halfway up the mountain he found a house.Ill stop here he thought to himself and see if theyll take me into service.Now this house was occupied by three people old Yezibaba who was a bad old witch her husband who was a wizard but not so bad as Yezibaba and their daughter Ludmila the sweetest kindest girl that two wicked parents ever had.Good day to you all Raduz said as he stepped into the house and bowed.The same to you old Yezibaba answered. What brings you hereIm looking for work and I thought you might have something for me to do.What can you do Yezibaba asked.Ill do anything you set me to. Im trustworthy and industrious.Yezibaba didnt want to take him but the old man wanted him and in the end Yezibaba with very ill grace consented to give him a trial.He rested that night and early next morning presented himself to the old witch and saidWhat work am I to do today mistressYezibaba looked him over from head to foot. Then she took him to a window and said What do you see out thereI see a rocky hillside.Good. Go to that rocky hillside cultivate it plant it in trees that will grow blossom and bear fruit tonight. Tomorrow morning bring me the ripe fruit. Here is a wooden hoe with which to work.Alas thought Raduz to himself did ever a man have such a task as this What can I do on that rocky hillside with a wooden hoe How can I finish my task in so short a timeHe started to work but he hadnt struck three blows with the wooden hoe before it broke. In despair he tossed it aside and sat down under a beech tree.In the meantime wicked old Yezibaba had cooked a disgusting mess of toads which she told Ludmila to carry out to the serving man for his dinner. Ludmila was sorry for the poor young man who had fallen into her mothers clutches and she said to herself What has he done to deserve such unkind treatment I wont let him eat this nasty mess. Ill share my own dinner with him.She waited until her mother was out of the room then she took Yezibabas magic wand and hid it under her apron. After that she hurried out to Raduz whom she found sitting under the beech tree with his face in his hands.Dont be discouraged she said to him. It is true your mistress cooked you a mess of toads for your dinner but see I have thrown them away and have brought you my own dinner instead. As for your task she continued I will help you with that. Here is my mothers magic wand. I have but to strike the rocky hillside and by tomorrow the trees that my mother has ordered will spring up blossom and bear fruit.Ludmila did as she promised. She struck the ground with the magic wand and instantly instead of the rocky hillside there appeared an orchard with rows on rows of trees that blossomed and bore fruit as you watched them.Raduz looked from Ludmila to the orchard and couldnt find words with which to express his surprise and gratitude. Then Ludmila spread out her dinner and together they ate it laughing merrily and talking. Raduz would have kept Ludmila all the afternoon but she remembered that Yezibaba was waiting for her and she hurried away.The next morning Raduz presented Yezibaba a basket of ripe fruit. She sniffed it suspiciously and then very grudgingly acknowledged that he had accomplished his task.What am I to do today Raduz asked.Yezibaba led him to a second window and asked him what he saw there.I see a rocky ravine covered with brambles he said.Right. Go now and clear away the brambles dig up the ravine and plant it in grape vines. Tomorrow morning bring me the ripe grapes. Here is another wooden hoe with which to work.Raduz took the hoe and set to work manfully. At the first blow the hoe broke into three pieces.Alas he thought what is going to happen to me now Unless Ludmila helps me again I am lost.At home Yezibaba was busy cooking a mess of serpents. When noonday came she said to Ludmila Here my child is dinner for the serving man. Take it out to him.Ludmila took the nasty mess and as on the day before threw it away. Then again hiding Yezibabas wand under her apron she went to Raduz carrying in her hands her own dinner.Raduz saw her coming and at once his heart grew light and he thought to himself how kind Ludmila was and how beautiful.I have been sitting here idle he told her for at the first blow my hoe broke. Unless you help me I dont know what I shall do.Dont worry Ludmila said. It is true your mistress sent you a mess of serpents for your dinner but I threw them out and have brought you my own dinner instead. And Ive brought the magic wand too so it will be easy enough to plant a vineyard that will produce ripe grapes by tomorrow morning.They ate together and after dinner Ludmila took the wand and struck the earth. At once a vineyard appeared and as they watched the vines blossomed and the blooms turned to grapes.It was harder than before for Raduz to let Ludmila go for he wanted to keep on talking to her forever but she remembered that Yezibaba was waiting for her and she hurried away.The next morning when Raduz presented a basket of ripe grapes old Yezibaba could scarcely believe her eyes. She sniffed the grapes suspiciously and then very grudgingly acknowledged that he had accomplished his second task.What am I to do today Raduz asked.Yezibaba led him to a third window and told him to look out and tell her what he saw.I see a great rocky cliff.Right she said. Go now to that cliff and grind me flour out of the rocks and from the flour bake me bread. Tomorrow morning bring me the fresh loaves. Today you shall have no tools of any kind. Go now and do this task or suffer the consequences.As Raduz started off Yezibaba looked after him and shook her head suspiciously.I dont understand this she said to her husband. He could never have done these two tasks alone. Do you suppose Ludmila has been helping him Ill punish her if she hasShame on you the old man said to talk so of your own daughter Ludmila is a good girl and has always been loyal and obedient.I hope so Yezibaba said but just the same I think I myself will carry him out his dinner today.Nonsense old woman Youll do no such thing Youre always smelling a rat somewhere Let the boy alone and dont go nagging at Ludmila eitherSo Yezibaba said no more. This time she cooked a mess of lizards for Raduz dinner.Here Ludmila she said carry this out to the young man. But see that you dont talk to him. And hurry back.Poor Raduz had been pounding stones one on another as well as he could but he hadnt been able to grind any of them into flour. As noonday approached he kept looking up anxiously to see whether beautiful Ludmila was again coming to help him.Here I am she called while she was yet some distance away. You were to have lizard stew today but see I am bringing you my own dinnerThen she told him what she had heard Yezibaba say to her father.Today she almost brought you your dinner herself for she suspects that I have been helping you. If she knew that I really had she would kill you.Dear Ludmila Raduz said I know very well that without you I am lost How can I ever thank you for all you have done for meLudmila said she didnt want thanks. She was helping Raduz because she was sorry for him and loved him.Then she took Yezibabas wand and struck the rocky cliff. At once instead of the bare rock there were sacks of grain and a millstone that worked merrily away grinding out fine flour. As you watched the flour was kneaded up into loaves and then pop went the loaves into a hot oven and soon the air was sweet with the smell of baking bread.Raduz begged Ludmila to stay and talk to him but she remembered that the old witch was waiting for her and she hurried home.The next morning Raduz carried the baked loaves to Yezibaba. She sniffed at them suspiciously and then her wicked heart nearly cracked with bitterness to think that Raduz had accomplished his third task. But she hid her disappointment and pretending to smile she saidI see my dear boy that you have been able to do all the tasks that I have set you. This is enough for the present. Today you may rest.That night the old witch hatched the plot of boiling Raduz alive. She had him fill a big cauldron with water and put it on the fire. Then she said to her husbandNow old man Im going to take a nap but when the water boils wake me up.As soon as Yezibaba was asleep Ludmila gave the old man strong wine until he too fell asleep. Then she called Raduz and told him what Yezibaba was planning to do.You must escape while you can she said for if you are here tomorrow you will surely be thrown into the boiling cauldron.But Raduz had fallen too deeply in love with Ludmila to leave her and now he declared that he would never go unless she went with him.Very well Ludmila said I will go with you if you swear you will never forget me.Forget you How could I forget you Raduz said when I wouldnt give you up for the whole worldSo Raduz took a solemn oath and they made ready to flee. Ludmila threw down her kerchief in one corner of the house and Raduz cap in another. Then she took Yezibabas wand and off they started.The next morning when the old man awoke he called out Hi there boy Are you still asleepNo Im not asleep answered Raduz cap. Im just stretching.Presently the old man called out again Here boy hand me my clothes.In a minute the cap answered. Just wait till I put on my slippers.Then old Yezibaba awoke. Ludmila she cried. Get up you lazy girl and hand me my skirt and bodice.In a minute In a minute the kerchief answered.Whats the matter Yezibaba scolded. Why are you so long dressingJust one more minute the kerchief said.But Yezibaba who was an impatient old witch sat up in bed and then she could see that Ludmilas bed was empty. That threw her into a fine rage and she called out to her husbandNow old man what have you got to say As sure as Im alive that goodfornothing boy is gone and that precious daughter of yours has gone with himNo no the old man said. I dont think so.Then they both got up and sure enough neither Raduz nor Ludmila was to be found.What do you think now you old booby Yezibaba shouted. A mighty good and loyal and obedient girl that daughter of yours is But why do you stand there all day Mount the black steed and fly after them and when you overtake them bring them back to me and Ill punish them properlyIn the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were fleeing as fast as they could.Suddenly Ludmila said Oh how my left cheek burns I wonder what it means Look back dear Raduz and see if there is any one following us.Raduz turned and looked. Theres nothing following us he said but a black cloud in the sky.A black cloud Thats the old man on the black horse that rides on the clouds. Quick We must be ready for himLudmila struck the ground with Yezibabas wand and changed it into a field. She turned herself into the growing rye and made Raduz the reaper who was cutting the rye. Then she instructed him how to answer the old man with cunning.The black cloud descended upon them with thunder and a shower of hailstones that beat down the growing rye.Take care Raduz cried. Youre trampling my rye Leave some of it for me.Very well the old man said alighting from his steed Ill leave some of it for you. But tell me reaper have you seen anything of two young people passing this wayNot a soul has passed while Ive been reaping but I do remember that while I was planting this field two such people did pass.The old man shook his head mounted his steed and flew home again on the black cloud.Well old wiseacre said Yezibaba what brings you back so soonNo use my going on the old man said. The only person I saw was a reaper in a field of rye.You booby cried Yezibaba not to know that Raduz was the reaper and Ludmila the rye How they fooled you And didnt you bring me back just one stalk of rye Go after them again and this time dont let them fool youIn the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were hurrying on. Suddenly Ludmila saidI wonder why my left cheek burns Look back dear Raduz and see if there is any one following us.Raduz turned and looked. Theres nothing following us but a gray cloud in the sky.A gray cloud Thats the old man on the gray horse that rides on the clouds. But dont be afraid. Only have ready a cunning answer.Ludmila struck her hat with the wand and changed it into a chapel. Herself she changed into a fly that attracted a host of other flies. She changed Raduz into a hermit. All the flies flew into the chapel and Raduz began preaching to them.Suddenly the gray cloud descended on the chapel with a flurry of snow and such cold that the shingles of the roof crackled.The old man alighted from the gray steed and entered the chapel.Hermit he said to Raduz have you seen two travelers go by here a girl and a youthAs long as Ive been preaching here Raduz said Ive had only flies for a congregation. But I do remember that while the chapel was building two such people did go by. But now I must beg you good sir to go out for you are letting in so much cold that my congregation is freezing.At that the old man mounted his steed and flew back home on the gray cloud.Old Yezibaba was waiting for him. When she saw him coming she called outAgain you bring no one you goodfornothing Where did you leave them this timeWhere did I leave them the old man said. How could I leave them when I didnt even see them All I saw was a little chapel and a hermit preaching to a congregation of flies. I almost froze the congregation to deathOh what a booby you are Yezibaba cried. Raduz was the hermit and Ludmila one of the flies Why didnt you bring me just one shingle from the roof of the chapel I see Ill have to go after them myselfIn a rage she mounted the third magic steed and flew off.In the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were hurrying on. Suddenly Ludmila saidI wonder why my left cheek burns Look back dear Raduz again and see if there is any one following us.Raduz turned and looked. Theres nothing following us but a red cloud in the sky.A red cloud That must be Yezibaba herself on the steed of fire. Now indeed we must be careful. Up to this it has been easy enough but it wont be easy to deceive her. Here we are beside a lake. I will change myself into a golden duck and float on the water. Do you dive into the water so that she cant burn you. When she alights and tries to catch me do you jump up and get the horse by the bridle. Dont be afraid at what will happen.The fiery cloud descended burning up everything it touched. At the edge of the water Yezibaba alighted from her steed and tried to catch the golden duck. The duck fluttered on and on just out of her reach and Yezibaba went farther and farther from her horse.Then Raduz leaped out of the water and caught the horse by its bridle. At once the duck rose on its wings and flew to Raduz and became again Ludmila. Together they mounted the fiery steed and flew off over the lake.Yezibaba helpless with rage and dismay called after them a bitter curseIf you Raduz are kissed by woman before you wed Ludmila then will you forget Ludmila And you ungrateful girl if once Raduz forgets you then he shall not remember you again until seven long years have come and goneRaduz and Ludmila rode on and on until they neared Raduz native city. There they met a man of whom Raduz asked the news.News indeed the man said. The king and his three older sons are dead. Only the queen is alive and she cries night and day for her youngest son who went out into the world and has never been heard of since. The whole city is in an uproar as to who shall be the new king.When Raduz heard this he said to Ludmila Do you my dear Ludmila wait for me here outside the city while I go quickly to the palace and let it be known that I am alive and am returned. It would not be fitting to present you to my mother the queen in those ragged clothes. As soon as I am made king I shall come for you bringing you a beautiful dress.Ludmila agreed to this and Raduz left her and hurried to the castle. His mother recognized him at once and ran with open arms to greet him. She wanted to kiss him but he wouldnt let her. The news of his return flew abroad and he was immediately proclaimed king. A great feast was spread and all the people ate and drank and made merry.Fatigued with his journey and with the excitement of his return Raduz lay down to rest. While he slept his mother came in and kissed him on both cheeks. Instantly Yezibabas curse was fulfilled and all memory of Ludmila left him.Poor Ludmila waited for his return but he never came. Then she knew what must have happened. Heartbroken and lonely she found a spot near a farmhouse that commanded a view of the castle and she stood there day after day hoping to see Raduz. She stood there so long that finally she took root and grew up into a poplar tree that was so beautiful that soon throughout the countryside people began talking about it. Every one admired it but the young king. He when he looked at it always felt unhappy and he supposed this was because it obstructed the view from his window. At last he ordered it to be cut down.The farmer near whose house it stood begged hard to have it saved but the king was firm.Shortly after the poplar was cut down there grew up under the kings very window a pretty little pear tree that bore golden pears. It was a wonderful little tree. No matter how many pears you picked in the evening by the next morning the tree would again be full.The king loved the little tree and was forever talking about it. The old queen on the other hand disliked it.I wish that tree would die she used to say. Theres something strange about it that makes me nervous.The king begged her to leave the tree alone but she worried and complained and nagged until at last for his own peace of mind he had the poor little pear tree cut down.The seven years of Yezibabas curse at last ran out. Then Ludmila changed herself again into a little golden duck and went swimming about on the lake that was under the kings window.Suddenly the king began to remember that he had seen that duck before. He ordered it to be caught and brought to him. But none of his people could catch it. Then he called together all the fishermen and birdcatchers in the country but none of them could catch the strange duck.The days went by and the kings mind was more and more engrossed with the thought of the golden duck. If no one can catch it for me he said at last I must try to catch it myself.So he went to the lake and reached out his hand after the golden duck. The duck led him on and on but at last she allowed herself to be caught. As soon as she was in his hand she changed to herself and Raduz recognized her as his own beautiful Ludmila.She said to him I have been true to you but you have forgotten me all these years. Yet I forgive you for it was not your fault.In Raduz heart his old love returned a hundredfold and he was overjoyed to lead Ludmila to the castle. He presented her to his mother and saidThis is she who saved my life many times. She and no one else will be my wife.A great wedding feast was prepared and so at last Raduz married the faithful Ludmila.
Somewhere or other but I dont know where there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine fields of rape but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields. The king was extremely angry at this and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to the ricks but it was all of no usenot a soul could they see. Then he offered nine hundred crowns to anyone who caught the evildoer and at the same time ordered that whoever did not keep proper watch over the fields should be killed but though there were a great many people none seemed able to protect the fields.The king had already put ninetynine people to death when a little swineherd came to him who had two dogs one was called Psst and the other Hush and the boy told the king that he would watch over the ricks.When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick from where he could see the whole field. About eleven oclock he thought he saw someone going to a rick and putting a light to it. Just you wait thought he and called out to his dogs Hi Psst Hush catch him But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders and in five minutes the man was caught.Next morning he was brought bound before the king who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once. The prisoner was all covered with hair almost like an animal and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder.The prince lets out the hairy man. Illustration by H.J. Ford published in The Crimson Fairy Book by Andrew Lang 1903 Longmans Green and Co.That was all very well but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at the hairy man also and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him. He stole the key of the strong room from his mother and opened the door. Then he took the key back but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world.Then the kings and princes began to arrive one after another and all were most anxious to see the hairy man but he was gone The king nearly burst with rage and with the shame he felt. He questioned his wife sharply and told her that if she could not find and bring back the hairy man he would put her in a hut made of rushes and burn her there. The queen declared she had had nothing to do with the matter if her son had happened to take the key it had not been with her knowledge.So they fetched the little prince and asked him all sorts of questions and at last he owned that he had let the hairy man out. The king ordered his servants to take the boy into the forest and to kill him there and to bring back part of his liver and lungs.There was grief all over the palace when the kings command was known for he was a great favourite. But there was no help for it and they took the boy out into the forest. But the man was sorry for him and shot a dog and carried pieces of his lungs and liver to the king who was satisfied and did not trouble himself any more.The prince wandered about in the forest and lived as best he could for five years. One day he came upon a poor little cottage in which was an old man. They began to talk and the prince told his story and sad fate. Then they recognised each other for the old fellow was no other than the hairy man whom the prince had set free and who had lived ever since in the forest.The prince stayed here for two years then he wished to go further. The old man begged him hard to stay but he would not so his hairy friend gave him a golden apple out of which came a horse with a golden mane and a golden staff with which to guide the horse. The old man also gave him a silver apple out of which came the most beautiful hussars and a silver staff and a copper apple from which he could draw as many foot soldiers as ever he wished and a copper staff. He made the prince swear solemnly to take the greatest care of these presents and then he let him go.The boy wandered on and on till he came to a large town. Here he took service in the kings palace and as no one troubled themselves about him he lived quietly on.One day news was brought to the king that he must go out to war. He was horribly frightened for he had a very small army but he had to go all the same.When they had all left the prince said to the housekeeperGive me leave to go to the next villageI owe a small bill there and I want to go and pay it and as there was nothing to be done in the palace the housekeeper gave him leave.When he got beyond the town he took out his golden apple and when the horse sprang out he swung himself into the saddle. Then he took the silver and the copper apples and with all these fine soldiers he joined the kings army.The king saw them approach with fear in his heart for he did not know if it might not be an enemy but the prince rode up and bowed low before him. I bring your Majesty reinforcements said he.The king was delighted and all dread of his enemy at once disappeared. The princesses were there too and they were very friendly with the prince and begged him to get into their carriage so as to talk to them. But he declined and remained on horseback as he did not know at what moment the battle might begin and whilst they were all talking together the youngest princess who was also the loveliest took off her ring and her sister tore her handkerchief in two pieces and they gave these gifts to the prince.Suddenly the enemy came in sight. The king asked whether his army or the princes should lead the way but the prince set off first and with his hussars he fought so bravely that only two of the enemy were left alive and these two were only spared to act as messengers.The king was overjoyed and so were his daughters at this brilliant victory. As they drove home they begged the prince to join them but he would not come and galloped off with his hussars.When he got near the town he packed his soldiers and his fine horse all carefully into the apple again and then strolled into the town. On his return to the palace he was well scolded by the housekeeper for staying away so long.Well the whole matter might have ended there but it so happened that the younger princess had fallen in love with the prince as he had with her. And as he had no jewels with him he gave her the copper apple and staff.One day as the princesses were talking with their father the younger one asked him whether it might not have been their servant who had helped him so much. The king was quite angry at the idea but to satisfy her he ordered the servants room to be searched. And there to everyones surprise they found the golden ring and the half of the handkerchief. When these were brought to the king he sent for the prince at once and asked if it had been he who had come to their rescue.Yes your Majesty it was I answered the prince.But where did you get your armyIf you wish to see it I can show it you outside the city walls.And so he did but first he asked for the copper apple from the younger princess and when all the soldiers were drawn up there were such numbers that there was barely room for them.The king gave him his daughter and kingdom as a reward for his aid and when he heard that the prince was himself a kings son his joy knew no bounds. The prince packed all his soldiers carefully up once more and they went back into the town.Not long after there was a grand wedding perhaps they may all be alive still but I dont know.
Once upon a time there lived a woman who had one son whom she loved dearly. The little cottage in which they dwelt was built on the outskirts of a forest and as they had no neighbours the place was very lonely and the boy was kept at home by his mother to bear her company.They were sitting together on a winters evening when a storm suddenly sprang up and the wind blew the door open. The woman started and shivered and glanced over her shoulder as if she half expected to see some horrible thing behind her. Go and shut the door she said hastily to her son I feel frightened.Frightened  repeated the boy. What does it feel like to be frightened Well  just frightened answered the mother. A fear of something you hardly know what takes hold of you.It must be very odd to feel like that replied the boy. I will go through the world and seek fear till I find it. And the next morning before his mother was out of bed he had left the forest behind him.After walking for some hours he reached a mountain which he began to climb. Near the top in a wild and rocky spot he came upon a band of fierce robbers sitting round a fire. The boy who was cold and tired was delighted to see the bright flames so he went up to them and said Good greeting to you sirs and wriggled himself in between the men till his feet almost touched the burning logs.The robbers stopped drinking and eyed him curiously and at last the captain spoke.No caravan of armed men would dare to come here even the very birds shun our camp and who are you to venture in so boldly Oh I have left my mothers house in search of fear. Perhaps you can show it to me Fear is wherever we are answered the captain.But where  asked the boy looking round. I see nothing.Take this pot and some flour and butter and sugar over to the churchyard which lies down there and bake us a cake for supper replied the robber. And the boy who was by this time quite warm jumped up cheerfully and slinging the pot over his arm ran down the hill.When he got to the churchyard he collected some sticks and made a fire then he filled the pot with water from a little stream close by and mixing the flour and. butter and sugar together he set the cake on. to cook. It was not long before it grew crisp and brown and then the boy lifted it from the pot and placed it on a stone while he put out the fire. At that moment a hand was stretched from a grave and a voice saidIs that cake for me Do you think I am going to give to the dead the food of the living  replied the boy with a laugh. And giving the hand a tap with his spoon and picking up the cake he went up the mountain side whistling merrily.Well have you found fear  asked the robbers when he held out the cake to the captain.No was it there  answered the boy. I saw nothing but a hand which came from a grave and belonged to someone who wanted my cake but I just rapped the fingers with my spoon and said it was not for him and then the hand vanished. Oh how nice the fire is  And he flung himself on his knees before it and so did not notice the glances of surprise cast by the robbers at each other.There is another chance for you said one at length. On the other side of the mountain lies a deep pool go to that and perhaps you may meet fear on the way.I hope so indeed answered the boy. And he set out at once.He soon beheld the waters of the pool gleaming in the moonlight and as he drew near he saw a tall swing standing just over it and in the swing a child was seated weeping bitterly.That is a strange place for a swing thought the boy but I wonder what he is crying about. And he was hurrying on towards the child when a maiden ran up and spoke to him.I want to lift my little brother from the swing cried she but it is so high above me that I cannot reach. If you will get closer to the edge of the pool and let me mount on your shoulder I think I can reach him.Willingly replied the boy and in an instant the girl had climbed to his shoulders. But instead of lifting the child from the swing as she could easily have done she pressed her feet so firmly on each side of the youths neck that be felt that in another minute he would be choked or else fall into the water beneath him. So gathering up all his strength he gave a mighty heave and threw the girl backwards. As she touched the ground a bracelet fell from her arm and this the youth picked up.I may as well keep it as a remembrance of all the queer things that have happened to me since I left home he said to himself and turning to look for the child he saw that both it and the swing had vanished and that the first streaks of dawn were in the sky.With the bracelet on his arm the youth started for a little town which was situated in the plain on the further side of the mountain and as hungry and thirsty he entered its principal street an ogre stopped him. Where did you get that bracelet  asked the ogre. It belongs to me.No it is mine replied the boy.It is not. Give it to me at once or it will be the worse for you  cried the ogre.Let us go before a judge and tell him our stories said the boy. If he decides in your favour you shall have it if in mine I will keep it To this the ogre agreed and the two went together to the great hail in which the kadi was administering justice. He listened very carefully to what each had to say and then pronounced his verdict. Neither of the two claimants had proved his right to the bracelet therefore it must remain in the possession of the judge till its fellow was brought before him.When they heard this the ogre and the boy looked at each other and their eyes said Where are we to go to find the other one  But as they knew there was no use in disputing the decision they bowed low and left the hall of audience.Wandering be knew not whither the youth found himself on the seashore. At a little distance was a ship which had struck on a hidden rock and was rapidly sinking while on deck the crew were gathered with faces white as death shrieking and wringing their hands.Have you met with fear  shouted the boy. And the answer came above the noise of the waves.Oh help  help  We are drowning Then the boy flung off his clothes and swam to the ship where many hands were held out to draw him on board.The ship is tossed hither and thither and will soon be sucked down cried the crew again. Death is very near and we are frightened Give me a rope said the boy in reply and he took it and made it safe round his body at one end and to the mast at the other and sprang into the sea. Down he went down down down till at last his feet touched the bottom and he stood up and looked about him. There sure enough a seamaiden with a wicked face was tugging hard at a chain which she had fastened to the ship with a grappling iron and was dragging it bit by bit beneath the waves. Seizing her arms in both his hands he forced her to drop the chain and the ship above remaining steady the sailors were able gently to float her off the rock. Then taking a rusty knife from a heap of seaweed at his feet he cut the rope round his waist and fastened the seamaiden firmly to a stone so that she could do no more mischief and bidding her farewell he swam back to the beach where his clothes were still lying.The youth dressed himself quickly and walked on till he came to a beautiful shady garden filled with flowers and with a clear little stream running through. The day was hot and he was tired so he entered the gate and seated himself under a clump of bushes covered with sweetsmelling red blossoms and it was not long before he fell asleep. Suddenly a rush of wings and a cool breeze awakened him and raising his head cautiously he saw three doves plunging into the stream. They splashed joyfully about and shook themselves and then dived to the bottom of a deep pool. When they appeared again they were no longer three doves but three beautiful damsels bearing between them a table made of mother of pearl. On this they placed drinking cups fashioned from pink and green shells and one of the maidens filled a cup from a crystal goblet and was raising it to her mouth when her sister stopped her.To whose health do you drink  asked she.To the youth who prepared the cake and rapped my hand with the spoon when I stretched it out of the earth answered the maiden and was never afraid as other men were  But to whose health do you drink To the youth on whose shoulders I climbed at the edge of the pool and who threw me off with such a jerk that I lay unconscious on the ground for hours replied the second. But you my sister added she turning to the third girl to whom do you drink Down in the sea I took hold of a ship and shook it and pulled it till it would soon have been lost said she. And as she spoke she looked quite different from what she had done with the chain in her hands seeking to work mischief. But a youth came and freed the ship and bound me to a rock. To his health I drink and they all three lifted their cups and drank silently.As they put their cups down the youth appeared before them.Here am I the youth whose health you have drunk and now give me the bracelet that matches a jewelled band which of a surety fell from the arm of one of you. An ogre tried to take it from me but I would not let him have it and he dragged me before the kadi who kept my bracelet till I could show him its fellow. And I have been wandering hither and thither in search of it and that is how I have found myself in such strange places.Come with us then said the maidens and they led him down a passage into a hall out of which opened many chambers each one of greater splendour than the last. From a shelf heaped up with gold and jewels the eldest sister took a bracelet which in every way was exactly like the one which was in the judges keeping and fastened it to the youths arm.Go at once and show this to the kadi said she and he will give you the fellow to it.I shall never forget you answered the youth but it may be long before we meet again for I shall never rest till I have found fear. Then he went his way and won the bracelet from the kadi. After this he again set forth in his quest of fear.On and on walked the youth but fear never crossed his path and one day he entered a large town where all the streets and squares were so full of people he could hardly pass between them.Why are all these crowds gathered together  he asked of a man who stood next him.The ruler of this country is dead was the reply and as he had no children it is needful to choose a successor. Therefore each morning one of the sacred pigeons is let loose from the tower yonder and on whomsoever the bird shall perch that man is our king. In a few minutes the pigeon will fly. Wait and see what happens.Every eye was fixed on the tall tower which stood in the centre of the chief square and the moment that the sun was seen to stand straight over it a door was opened and a beautiful pigeon gleaming with pink and grey blue and green came rushing through the air. Onward it flew onward onward till at length it rested on the head of the boy. Then a great shout aroseThe king  the king  but as he listened to the cries a vision swifter than lightning flashed across his brain. He saw himself seated on a throne spending his life trying and never succeeding to make poor people rich miserable people happy bad people good never doing anything he wished to do not able even to marry the girl that he loved.No  no  he shrieked hiding his face in his hands but the crowds who heard him thought he was overcome by the grandeur that awaited him and paid no heed.Well to make quite sure let fly more pigeons said they but each pigeon followed where the first had led and the cries arose louder than everThe king  the king  And as the young man heard a cold shiver that he knew not the meaning of ran through him.This is fear whom you have so long sought whispered a voice which seemed to reach his ears alone. And the youth bowed his head as the vision once more flashed before his eyes and he accepted his doom and made ready to pass his life with fear beside him.
There were once upon a time an old peasant and his wife and they had three sons. Two of them were clever young men who could borrow money without being cheated but the third was the Fool of the World. He was as simple as a child simpler than some children and he never did any one a harm in his life.Well it always happens like that. The father and mother thought a lot of the two smart young men but the Fool of the World was lucky if he got enough to eat because they always forgot him unless they happened to be looking at him and sometimes even then.But however it was with his father and mother this is a story that shows that God loves simple folk and turns things to their advantage in the end.For it happened that the Tzar of that country sent out messengers along the highroads and the rivers even to huts in the forest like ours to say that he would give his daughter the Princess in marriage to any one who could bring him a flying shipay a ship with wings that should sail this way and that through the blue sky like a ship sailing on the sea.This is a chance for us said the two clever brothers and that same day they set off together to see if one of them could not build the flying ship and marry the Tzars daughter and so be a great man indeed.And their father blessed them and gave them finer clothes than ever he wore himself. And their mother made them up hampers of food for the road soft white rolls and several kinds of cooked meats and bottles of corn brandy. She went with them as far as the highroad and waved her hand to them till they were out of sight. And so the two clever brothers set merrily off on their adventure to see what could be done with their cleverness. And what happened to them I do not know for they were never heard of again.The Fool of the World saw them set off with their fine parcels of food and their fine clothes and their bottles of corn brandy.Id like to go too says he and eat good meat with soft white rolls and drink corn brandy and marry the Tzars daughter.Stupid fellow says his mother whats the good of your going Why if you were to stir from the house you would walk into the arms of a bear and if not that then the wolves would eat you before you had finished staring at them.But the Fool of the World would not be held back by words.I am going says he. I am going. I am going. I am going.He went on saying this over and over again till the old woman his mother saw there was nothing to be done and was glad to get him out of the house so as to be quit of the sound of his voice. So she put some food in a bag for him to eat by the way. She put in the bag some crusts of dry black bread and a flask of water. She did not even bother to go as far as the footpath to see him on his way. She saw the last of him at the door of the hut and he had not taken two steps before she had gone back into the hut to see to more important business.No matter. The Fool of the World set off with his bag over his shoulder singing as he went for he was off to seek his fortune and marry the Tzars daughter. He was sorry his mother had not given him any corn brandy but he sang merrily for all that. He would have liked white rolls instead of the dry black crusts but after all the main thing on a journey is to have something to eat. So he trudged merrily along the road and sang because the trees were green and there was a blue sky overhead.He had not gone very far when he met an ancient old man with a bent back and a long beard and eyes hidden under his bushy eyebrows.Goodday young fellow says the ancient old man.Goodday grandfather says the Fool of the World.And where are you off to says the ancient old man.What says the Fool havent you heard The Tzar is going to give his daughter to any one who can bring him a flying ship.And you can really make a flying ship says the ancient old man.No I do not know how.Then what are you going to doGod knows says the Fool of the World.Well says the ancient if things are like that sit you down here. We will rest together and have a bite of food. Bring out what you have in your bag.I am ashamed to offer you what I have here. It is good enough for me but it is not the sort of meal to which one can ask guests.Never mind that. Out with it. Let us eat what God has given.The Fool of the World opened his bag and could hardly believe his eyes. Instead of black crusts he saw fresh white rolls and cooked meats. He handed them out to the ancient who said You see how God loves simple folk. Although your own mother does not love you you have not been done out of your share of the good things. Lets have a sip at the corn brandy.The Fool of the World opened his flask and instead of water there came out corn brandy and that of the best. So the Fool and the ancient made merry eating and drinking and when they had done and sung a song or two together the ancient says to the FoolListen to me. Off with you into the forest. Go up to the first big tree you see. Make the sacred sign of the cross three times before it. Strike it a blow with your little hatchet. Fall backwards on the ground and lie there full length on your back until somebody wakes you up. Then you will find the ship made all ready to fly. Sit you down in it and fly off whither you want to go. But be sure on the way to give a lift to everyone you meet.The Fool of the World thanked the ancient old man said goodbye to him and went off to the forest. He walked up to a tree the first big tree he saw made the sign of the cross three times before it swung his hatchet round his head struck a mighty blow on the trunk of the tree instantly fell backwards flat on the ground closed his eyes and went to sleep.A little time went by and it seemed to the Fool as he slept that somebody was jogging his elbow. He woke up and opened his eyes. His hatchet worn out lay beside him. The big tree was gone and in its place there stood a little ship ready and finished. The Fool did not stop to think. He jumped into the ship seized the tiller and sat down. Instantly the ship leapt up into the air and sailed away over the tops of the trees.The little ship answered the tiller as readily as if she were sailing in water and the Fool steered for the highroad and sailed along above it for he was afraid of losing his way if he tried to steer a course across the open country.He flew on and on and looked down and saw a man lying in the road below him with his ear on the damp ground.Goodday to you uncle cried the Fool.Goodday to you Skyfellow cried the man.What are you doing down there says the Fool.I am listening to all that is being done in the world.Take your place in the ship with me.The man was willing enough and sat down in the ship with the Fool and they flew on together singing songs.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man on one leg with the other tied up to his head.Goodday uncle says the Fool bringing the ship to the ground. Why are you hopping along on one footIf I were to untie the other I should move too fast. I should be stepping across the world in a single stride.Sit down with us says the Fool.The man sat down with them in the ship and they flew on together singing songs.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man with a gun and he was taking aim but what he was aiming at they could not see.Good health to you uncle says the Fool. But what are you shooting at There isnt a bird to be seen.What says the man. If there were a bird that you could see I should not shoot at it. A bird or a beast a thousand versts away thats the sort of mark for me.Take your seat with us says the Fool.The man sat down with them in the ship and they flew on together. Louder and louder rose their songs.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man carrying a sack full of bread on his back.Good health to you uncle says the Fool sailing down. And where are you off toI am going to get bread for my dinner.But youve got a full sack on your back.Thatthat little scrap Why thats not enough for a single mouthful.Take your seat with us says the Fool.The Eater sat down with them in the ship and they flew on together singing louder than ever.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man walking round and round a lake.Good health to you uncle says the Fool. What are you looking forI want a drink and I cant find any water.But theres a whole lake in front of your eyes. Why cant you take a drink from thatThat little drop says the man. Why theres not enough water there to wet the back of my throat if I were to drink it at one gulp.Take your seat with us says the Fool.The Drinker sat down with them and again they flew on singing in chorus.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man walking towards the forest with a fagot of wood on his shoulders.Goodday to you uncle says the Fool. Why are you taking wood to the forestThis isnt simple wood says the man.What is it then says the Fool.If it is scattered about a whole army of soldiers leaps up out of the ground.Theres a place for you with us says the Fool.The man sat down with them and the ship rose up into the air and flew on carrying its singing crew.They flew on and on and looked down and there was a man carrying a sack of straw.Good health to you uncle says the Fool and where are you taking your strawTo the village.Why are they short of straw in your villageNo but this is such straw that if you scatter it abroad in the very hottest of the summer instantly the weather turns cold and there is snow and frost.Theres a place here for you too says the Fool.Very kind of you says the man and steps in and sits down and away they all sail together singing like to burst their lungs.They did not meet any one else and presently came flying up to the palace of the Tzar. They flew down and cast anchor in the courtyard.Just then the Tzar was eating his dinner. He heard their loud singing and looked out of the window and saw the ship come sailing down into his courtyard. He sent his servant out to ask who was the great prince who had brought him the flying ship and had come sailing down with such a merry noise of singing.The servant came up to the ship and saw the Fool of the World and his companions sitting there cracking jokes. He saw they were all moujiks simple peasants sitting in the ship so he did not stop to ask questions but came back quietly and told the Tzar that there were no gentlemen in the ship at all but only a lot of dirty peasants.Now the Tzar was not at all pleased with the idea of giving his only daughter in marriage to a simple peasant and he began to think how he could get out of his bargain. Thinks he to himself Ill set them such tasks that they will not be able to perform and theyll be glad to get off with their lives and I shall get the ship for nothing.So he told his servant to go to the Fool and tell him that before the Tzar had finished his dinner the Fool was to bring him some of the magical water of life.Now while the Tzar was giving this order to his servant the Listener the first of the Fools companions was listening and heard the words of the Tzar and repeated them to the Fool.What am I to do now says the Fool stopping short in his jokes. In a year in a whole century I never could find that water. And he wants it before he has finished his dinner.Dont you worry about that says the Swiftgoer Ill deal with that for you.The servant came and announced the Tzars command.Tell him he shall have it says the Fool.His companion the Swiftgoer untied his foot from beside his head put it to the ground wriggled it a little to get the stiffness out of it ran off and was out of sight almost before he had stepped from the ship. Quicker than I can tell it you in words he had come to the water of life and put some of it in a bottle.I shall have plenty of time to get back thinks he and down he sits under a windmill and goes off to sleep.The royal dinner was coming to an end and there wasnt a sign of him. There were no songs and no jokes in the flying ship. Everybody was watching for the Swiftgoer and thinking he would not be in time.The Listener jumped out and laid his right ear to the damp ground listened a moment and said What a fellow He has gone to sleep under the windmill. I can hear him snoring. And there is a fly buzzing with its wings perched on the windmill close above his head.This is my affair says the Farshooter and he picked up his gun from between his knees aimed at the fly on the windmill and woke the Swiftgoer with the thud of the bullet on the wood of the mill close by his head. The Swiftgoer leapt up and ran and in less than a second had brought the magic water of life and given it to the Fool. The Fool gave it to the servant who took it to the Tzar. The Tzar had not yet left the table so that his command had been fulfilled as exactly as ever could be.What fellows these peasants are thought the Tzar. There is nothing for it but to set them another task. So the Tzar said to his servant Go to the captain of the flying ship and give him this message If you are such a cunning fellow you must have a good appetite. Let you and your companions eat at a single meal twelve oxen roasted whole and as much bread as can be baked in forty ovensThe Listener heard the message and told the Fool what was coming. The Fool was terrified and said I cant get through even a single loaf at a sitting.Dont worry about that said the Eater. It wont be more than a mouthful for me and I shall be glad to have a little snack in place of my dinner.The servant came and announced the Tzars command.Good says the Fool. Send the food along and well know what to do with it.So they brought twelve oxen roasted whole and as much bread as could be baked in forty ovens and the companions had scarcely sat down to the meal before the Eater had finished the lot.Why said the Eater what a little They might have given us a decent meal while they were about it.The Tzar told his servant to tell the Fool that he and his companions were to drink forty barrels of wine with forty bucketfuls in every barrel.The Listener told the Fool what message was coming.Why says the Fool I never in my life drank more than one bucket at a time.Dont worry says the Drinker. You forget that I am thirsty. Itll be nothing of a drink for me.They brought the forty barrels of wine and tapped them and the Drinker tossed them down one after another one gulp for each barrel. Little enough says he Why I am thirsty still.Very good says the Tzar to his servant when he heard that they had eaten all the food and drunk all the wine. Tell the fellow to get ready for the wedding and let him go and bathe himself in the bathhouse. But let the bathhouse be made so hot that the man will stifle and frizzle as soon as he sets foot inside. It is an iron bathhouse. Let it be made red hot.The Listener heard all this and told the Fool who stopped short with his mouth open in the middle of a joke.Dont you worry says the moujik with the straw.Well they made the bathhouse red hot and called the Fool and the Fool went along to the bathhouse to wash himself and with him went the moujik with the straw.They shut them both into the bathhouse and thought that that was the end of them. But the moujik scattered his straw before them as they went in and it became so cold in there that the Fool of the World had scarcely time to wash himself before the water in the cauldrons froze to solid ice. They lay down on the very stove itself and spent the night there shivering.In the morning the servants opened the bathhouse and there were the Fool of the World and the moujik alive and well lying on the stove and singing songs.They told the Tzar and the Tzar raged with anger. There is no getting rid of this fellow says he. But go and tell him that I send him this message If you are to marry my daughter you must show that you are able to defend her. Let me see that you have at least a regiment of soldiers Thinks he to himself How can a simple peasant raise a troop He will find it hard enough to raise a single soldier.The Listener told the Fool of the World and the Fool began to lament. This time says he I am done indeed. You my brothers have saved me from misfortune more than once but this time alas there is nothing to be done.Oh what a fellow you are says the peasant with the fagot of wood. I suppose youve forgotten about me. Remember that I am the man for this little affair and dont you worry about it at all.The Tzars servant came along and gave his message.Very good says the Fool but tell the Tzar that if after this he puts me off again Ill make war on his country and take the Princess by force.And then as the servant went back with the message the whole crew on the flying ship set to their singing again and sang and laughed and made jokes as if they had not a care in the world.During the night while the others slept the peasant with the fagot of wood went hither and thither scattering his sticks. Instantly where they fell there appeared a gigantic army. Nobody could count the number of soldiers in itcavalry foot soldiers yes and guns and all the guns new and bright and the men in the finest uniforms that ever were seen.In the morning as the Tzar woke and looked from the windows of the palace he found himself surrounded by troops upon troops of soldiers and generals in cocked hats bowing in the courtyard and taking orders from the Fool of the World who sat there joking with his companions in the flying ship. Now it was the Tzars turn to be afraid. As quickly as he could he sent his servants to the Fool with presents of rich jewels and fine clothes invited him to come to the palace and begged him to marry the Princess.The Fool of the World put on the fine clothes and stood there as handsome a young man as a princess could wish for a husband. He presented himself before the Tzar fell in love with the Princess and she with him married her the same day received with her a rich dowry and became so clever that all the court repeated everything he said. The Tzar and the Tzaritza liked him very much and as for the Princess she loved him to distraction.
Once Fortune met Wisdom in a certain place.Get out of my way cried Fortune.At that time Wisdom was inexperienced and did not know which was to make room for the other she therefore saidWhy should I get out of your way Are you better than I amHe is better answered Fortune who can do most. Do you see that peasant boy ploughing the field Get inside him and if you succeed better than I I shall always and justly make room for you whenever we meet.Wisdom agreed to this proposal and entered at once into the ploughboys head. As soon as the boy felt that he had wisdom in his head he began to reason within himselfWhy should I walk until my lifes end behind the plough Surely I can somewhere else and more easily make my fortune.He left off working shut up the plough and drove home.Father he said I dont like the peasants work. I would rather learn to be a gardener.Vanek lost the hut but he did not care about that he went to the kings gardener to be taught the art of gardening. The gardener did not teach him much and yet Vanek learnt the business very quickly. In a short time he ceased to ask the gardener for instruction but did everything according to his own idea. At first the gardener was angry but when he saw that everything went better than before he was satisfied. I see he said you are wiser than I am. He then allowed Vanek to garden just as he liked.In a short time Vanek improved the garden so much that the king was greatly pleased with it and often walked in the garden with his wife and their only daughter. That daughter was a very beautiful girl but from her twelfth year she ceased to speak no one heard a word from her. The king was greatly grieved on that account and announced that whoever would make the princess speak again might take her for his wife. Many young princes dukes and other great men applied one after another but as they came so they went away not one of them succeeded in making the princess speak.And why should not I try my luck thought Vanek who knows perhaps I shall succeed in making her answer me when I question her.He presented himself at once before the king and the king with all his councillors took him to the apartments where his daughter lived. That daughter had a very beautiful little dog of which she was very fond because it was very clever it understood everything that she wanted. When Vanek with the king and the councillors came into the princesss room he pretended not to see the girl at all but turning to the little dog he saidI have heard my little dog that thou art very clever I have therefore come to thee for advice. There were three of us companionsa sculptor a tailor and myself. Once as we were walking through a forest we were obliged to stop in it for the night. In order to be secure from the wolves we lit a fire and agreed among ourselves to watch one after another. The sculptor watched first and in order to beguile the time he took a log of wood and cut out of it a beautiful girl. When it was ready the sculptor awoke the tailor and asked him to watch. The tailor seeing the wooden girl asked what it was. Just what you see answered the sculptor the time lay heavily on my hands and I have cut this girl out of a log of wood if you find the time tedious you may dress her. The tailor took out at once the scissors needles and thread cut the dress and began to sew it up when the dress was ready he dressed the girl in it. Afterwards he awoke me and asked me to watch. I said What have you got there Just what you see he answered the time lay heavily on the sculptors hands so he cut this girl out of a log of wood and I for the same reason have dressed her. Should you find the time tedious you may teach her to speak. I set to work and succeeded in teaching her to speak. But in the morning when my companions awoke each of them wanted to take the girl away. The sculptor said I have made her. The tailor said I have dressed her. I also defended my right. Tell me now my little dog to which of us does the girl belongThe little dog remained silent but instead of it the kings daughter saidTo whom should she belong but to you What is the use of the sculptors girl without life or of the tailors dress without speech You have conferred upon her the greatest giftslife and speechconsequently she belongs to you by right.You have decided about yourself said Vanek. I have given to you speech and new life consequently you belong to me by right.Then one of the kings councillors saidHis majesty the king will give you a rich reward because you have succeeded in unloosing his daughters tongue but you cannot take her for your wife because you are of mean birth.And the king addedBecause you are of mean birth I will give you instead of my daughter a rich reward.But Vanek would not even so much as hear of any other reward and answeredThe king promised without exception that whoever would make his daughter speak might take her for his wife. The kings word is law if the king wish that the people should keep the law he must keep it first himself. Consequently the king must give me his daughter for a wife.Guards seize him cried the same councillor.Whoever dares to say what the king should do offends the royal majesty and is guilty of death. May your majesty be pleased to order this criminal to be beheaded with the sword.The king said Let him be beheaded with the sword.Immediately the guards bound Vanek and led him to death. When they had arrived at the place of execution Fortune was already waiting for them there and whispered to WisdomSee how this man for following you is now about to lose his head. Get out of him and let me enter in your place.When gracious Fortune had entered into Vanek the executioners sword broke off at the handle just as if somebody had cut it in half and before another sword could be procured a messenger arrived on horseback from town blowing a trumpet and waving a white flag he was followed by a royal carriage for Vanek. It happened thus. The kings daughter had been telling her father at home that Vanek alone had spoken the truth and that the kings word could not be broken and although Vanek was of mean birth yet the king could easily make him a duke.The king said You are right let him be made a duke.Then a royal carriage was immediately sent for Vanek and in his stead was executed that councillor who had provoked the king against Vanek. When afterwards Vanek and the kings daughter rode together from the wedding Wisdom stood somewhere on the road and seeing that she must needs meet with Fortune she bent down her head and ran away aside as if sprinkled with water. From that moment Wisdom whenever about to meet with Fortune passes her at a distance.
Lusan went to bed without any supper but her little heart was hungry for something more than food. She nestled up close beside her sleeping brothers but even in their slumber they seemed to deny her that love which she craved. The gentle lapping of the water against the sides of the houseboat music which had so often lulled her into dreamland could not quiet her now. Scorned and treated badly by the entire family her short life had been full of grief and shame.Note You can read an illustrated version of this story plus other Chinese tales in our collection Chinese Tales An Enchanting Collection of 24 Chinese Folk Tales and Fairy Tales  now available for Amazon Kindle and paperback.Lusans father was a fisherman. His life had been one long fight against poverty. He was ignorant and wicked. He had no more feeling of love for his wife and five children than for the street dogs of his native city. Over and over he had threatened to drown them one and all and had been prevented from doing so only by fear of the new mandarin. His wife did not try to stop her husband when he sometimes beat the children until they fell half dead upon the deck. In fact she herself was cruel to them and often gave the last blow to Lusan her only daughter. Not on one day in the little girls memory had she escaped this daily whipping not once had her parents pitied her.On the night with which this story opens not knowing that Lusan was listening her father and mother were planning how to get rid of her.The mandarin cares only about boys said he roughly. A man might kill a dozen girls and he wouldnt say a word.Lusans no good anyway added the mother. Our boat is small and shes always in the wrong place.Yes and it takes as much to feed her as if she were a boy. If you say so Ill do it this very night.All right she answered but youd better wait till the moon has set.Very well wife well let the moon go down first and then the girl.No wonder Lusans little heart beat fast with terror for there could be no doubt as to the meaning of her parents words.At last when she heard them snoring and knew they were both sound asleep she got up silently dressed herself and climbed the ladder leading to the deck. Only one thought was in her heart to save herself by instant flight. There were no extra clothes not a bite of food to take with her. Besides the rags on her back there was only one thing she could call her own a tiny soapstone image of the goddess Kwanyin which she had found one day while walking in the sand. This was the only treasure and plaything of her childhood and if she had not watched carefully her mother would have taken even this away from her. Oh how she had nursed this idol and how closely she had listened to the stories an old priest had told about Kwanyin the Goddess of Mercy the best friend of women and children to whom they might always pray in time of trouble.It was very dark when Lusan raised the trapdoor leading to the outer air and looked out into the night. The moon had just gone down and frogs were croaking along the shore. Slowly and carefully she pushed against the door for she was afraid that the wind coming in suddenly might awaken the sleepers or worse still cause her to let the trap fall with a bang. At last however she stood on the deck alone and ready to go out into the big world. As she stepped to the side of the boat the black water did not make her feel afraid and she went ashore without the slightest tremble.Now she ran quickly along the bank shrinking back into the shadows whenever she heard the noise of footsteps and thus hiding from the passersby. Only once did her heart quake full of fear. A huge boat dog ran out at her barking furiously. The snarling beast however was not dangerous and when he saw this trembling little girl of ten he sniffed in disgust at having noticed any one so small and returned to watch his gate.Lusan had made no plans. She thought that if she could escape the death her parents had talked about they would be delighted at her leaving them and would not look for her. It was not then her own people that she feared as she passed the rows of dark houses lining the shore. She had often heard her father tell of the dreadful deeds done in many of these houseboats. The darkest memory of her childhood was of the night when he had almost decided to sell her as a slave to the owner of a boat like these she was now passing. Her mother had suggested that they should wait until Lusan was a little older for she would then be worth more money. So her father had not sold her. Lately perhaps he had tried and failed.That was why she hated the river dwellers and was eager to get past their houses. On and on she sped as fast as her little legs could carry her. She would flee far away from the dark water for she loved the bright sunshine and the land.As Lusan ran past the last houseboat she breathed a sigh of relief and a minute later fell in a little heap upon the sand. Not until now had she noticed how lonely it was. Over there was the great city with its thousands of sleepers. Not one of them was her friend. She knew nothing of friendship for she had had no playmates. Beyond lay the open fields the sleeping villages the unknown world. Ah how tired she was How far she had run Soon holding the precious image tightly in her little hand and whispering a childish prayer to Kwanyin she fell asleep.When Lusan awoke a cold chill ran through her body for bending over her stood a strange person. Soon she saw to her wonder that it was a woman dressed in beautiful clothes like those worn by a princess. The child had never seen such perfect features or so fair a face. At first conscious of her own filthy rags she shrank back fearfully wondering what would happen if this beautiful being should chance to touch her and thus soil those slender white fingers. As the child lay there trembling on the ground she felt as if she would like to spring into the fairy creatures arms and beg for mercy. Only the fear that the lovely one would vanish kept her from so doing. Finally unable to hold back any longer the little girl bending forward stretched out her hand to the woman saying Oh you are so beautiful Take this for it must be you who lost it in the sand.The princess took the soapstone figure eyed it curiously and then with a start of surprise said And do you know my little creature to whom you are thus giving your treasureNo answered the child simply but it is the only thing I have in all the world and you are so lovely that I know it belongs to you. I found it on the river bank.Then a strange thing happened. The graceful queenly woman bent over and held out her arms to the ragged dirty child. With a cry of joy the little one sprang forward she had found the love for which she had been looking so long.My precious child this little stone which you have kept so lovingly and which without a thought of self you have given to medo you know of whom it is the imageYes answered Lusan the colour coming to her cheeks again as she snuggled up contentedly in her new friends warm embrace it is the dear goddess Kwanyin she who makes the children happy.And has this gracious goddess brought sunshine into your life my pretty one said the other a slight flush covering her fair cheeks at the poor childs innocent words.Oh yes indeed if it had not been for her I should not have escaped tonight. My father would have killed me but the good lady of heaven listened to my prayer and bade me stay awake. She told me to wait until he was sleeping then to arise and leave the houseboat.And where are you going Lusan now that you have left your father Are you not afraid to be alone here at night on the bank of this great riverNo oh no for the blessed mother will shield me. She has heard my prayers and I know she will show me where to go.The lady clasped Lusan still more tightly and something glistened in her radiant eye. A teardrop rolled down her cheek and fell upon the childs head but Lusan did not see it for she had fallen fast asleep in her protectors arms.When Lusan awoke she was lying all alone on her bed in the houseboat but strange to say she was not frightened at finding herself once more near her parents. A ray of sunlight came in lighting up the childs face and telling her that a new day had dawned. At last she heard the sound of low voices but she did not know who were the speakers. Then as the tones grew louder she knew that her parents were talking. Their speech however seemed to be less harsh than usual as if they were near the bed of some sleeper whom they did not wish to wake.Why said her father when I bent over to lift her from the bed there was a strange light about her face. I touched her on the arm and at once my hand hung limp as if it had been shot. Then I heard a voice whispering in my ears What would you lay your wicked hands on one who made the tears of Kwanyin flow Do you not know that when she cries the gods themselves are weepingI too heard that voice said the mother her voice trembling I heard it and it seemed as if a hundred wicked imps pricked me with spears at every prick repeating these terrible words And would you kill a daughter of the godsIt is strange he added to think how we had begun to hate this child when all the time she belonged to another world than ours. How wicked we must be since we could not see her goodness.Yes and no doubt for every time we have struck her a thousand blows will be given us by Yama for our insults to the gods.Lusan waited no longer but rose to dress herself. Her heart was burning with love for everything around her. She would tell her parents that she forgave them tell them how she loved them still in spite of all their wickedness. To her surprise the ragged clothes were nowhere to be seen. In place of them she found on one side of the bed the most beautiful garments. The softest of silks bright with flowersso lovely that she fancied they must have been taken from the garden of the godswere ready to slip on her little body. As she dressed herself she saw with surprise that her fingers were shapely that her skin was soft and smooth. Only the day before her hands had been rough and cracked by hard work and the cold of winter. More and more amazed she stooped to put on her shoes. Instead of the wornout soiled shoes of yesterday the prettiest little satin slippers were there all ready for her tiny feet.Finally she climbed the rude ladder and lo everything she touched seemed to be changed as if by magic like her gown. The narrow rounds of the ladder had become broad steps of polished wood and it seemed as if she was mounting the polished stairway of some fairybuilt pagoda. When she reached the deck everything was changed. The ragged patchwork which had served so long as a sail had become a beautiful sheet of canvas that rolled and floated proudly in the river breeze. Below were the dirty fishing smacks which Lusan was used to but here was a stately ship larger and fairer than any she had ever dreamed of a ship which had sprung into being as if at the touch of her feet.After searching several minutes for her parents she found them trembling in a corner with a look of great fear on their faces. They were clad in rags as usual and in no way changed except that their savage faces seemed to have become a trifle softened. Lusan drew near the wretched group and bowed low before them.Her mother tried to speak her lips moved but made no sound she had been struck dumb with fear.A goddess a goddess murmured the father bending forward three times and knocking his head on the deck. As for the brothers they hid their faces in their hands as if dazzled by a sudden burst of sunlight.For a moment Lusan paused. Then stretching out her hand she touched her father on the shoulder. Do you not know me father It is Lusan your little daughter.The man looked at her in wonder. His whole body shook his lips trembled his hard brutish face had on it a strange light. Suddenly he bent far over and touched his forehead to her feet. Mother and sons followed his example. Then all gazed at her as if waiting for her command.Speak father said Lusan. Tell me that you love me say that you will not kill your child.Daughter of the gods and not of mine he mumbled and then paused as if afraid to continue.What is it father Have no fear.First tell me that you forgive me.The child put her left hand upon her fathers forehead and held the right above the heads of the others As the Goddess of Mercy has given me her favour so I in her name bestow on you the love of heaven. Live in peace my parents. Brothers speak no angry words. Oh my dear ones let joy be yours for ever. When only love shall rule your lives this ship is yours and all that is in it.Thus did Lusan change her loved ones. The miserable family which had lived in poverty now found itself enjoying peace and happiness. At first they did not know how to live as Lusan had directed. The father sometimes lost his temper and the mother spoke spiteful words but as they grew in wisdom and courage they soon began to see that only love must rule.All this time the great boat was moving up and down the river. Its company of sailors obeyed Lusans slightest wish. When their nets were cast overboard they were always drawn back full of the largest choicest fish. These fish were sold at the city markets and soon people began to say that Lusan was the richest person in the whole country.One beautiful day during the Second Moon the family had just returned from the temple. It was Kwanyins birthday and led by Lusan they had gone gladly to do the goddess honour. They had just mounted to the vessels deck when Lusans father who had been looking off towards the west suddenly called the family to his side. See he exclaimed. What kind of bird is that yonder in the skyAs they looked they saw that the strange object was coming nearer and nearer and directly towards the ship. Every one was excited except Lusan. She was calm as if waiting for something she had long expected.It is a flight of doves cried the father in astonishment and they seem to be drawing something through the air.At last as the birds flew right over the vessel the surprised onlookers saw that floating beneath their wings was a wonderful chair all white and gold more dazzling even than the one they had dreamed the Emperor himself sat in on the Dragon Throne. Around each snowwhite neck was fastened a long streamer of pure gold and these silken ribbons were tied to the chair in such a manner as to hold it floating wherever its lightwinged coursers chose to fly.Down down over the magic vessel came the empty chair and as it descended a shower of pure white lilies fell about the feet of Lusan until she the queen of all the flowers was almost buried. The doves hovered above her head for an instant and then gently lowered their burden until it was just in front of her.With a farewell wave to her father and mother Lusan stepped into the fairy car. As the birds began to rise a voice from the clouds spoke in tones of softest music Thus Kwanyin Mother of Mercies rewards Lusan daughter of the earth. Out of the dust spring the flowers out of the soil comes goodness. Lusan that tear which you drew from Kwanyins eye fell upon the dry ground and softened it it touched the hearts of those who loved you not. Daughter of earth no longer rise into the Western Heaven there to take your place among the fairies there to be a star within the azure realms above.As Lusans doves disappeared in the distant skies a rosy light surrounded her flying car. It seemed to those who gazed in wonder that heavens gates were opening to receive her. At last when she was gone beyond their sight suddenly it grew dark upon the earth and the eyes of all that looked were wet with tears.
A Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle with the waves. When he woke up he bitterly reproached the Sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface and then when they were well embarked turning in fury upon them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction. The Sea arose in the form of a woman and replied Lay not the blame on me O sailor but on the Winds. By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself but the Winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me.
Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty with a skin as soft and shining as silk and wise green eyes that could see even in the dark. His name was Gon and he belonged to a music teacher who was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for anything in the world.Listen to The Cats Elopement plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devicesNow not far from the music masters house there dwelt a lady who possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma. She was such a little dear altogether and blinked her eyes so daintily and ate her supper so tidily and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so delicately with her little tongue that her mistress was never tired of saying Koma Koma what should I do without youWell it happened one day that these two when out for an evening stroll met under a cherry tree and in one moment fell madly in love with each other. Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a wife for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy but he was not easy to please and did not care about any of them. Now before he had time to think Cupid had entangled him in his net and he was filled with love towards Koma. She fully returned his passion but like a woman she saw the difficulties in the way and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming them. Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma but her mistress would not part from her. Then the music master was asked to sell Gon to the lady but he declined to listen to any such suggestion so everything remained as before.At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they determined to please themselves and to seek their fortunes together. So one moonlight night they stole away and ventured out into an unknown world. All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine till they had left their homes far behind them and towards evening they found themselves in a large park. The wanderers by this time were very hot and tired and the grass looked very soft and inviting and the trees cast cool deep shadows when suddenly an ogre appeared in this Paradise in the shape of a big big dog He came springing towards them showing all his teeth and Koma shrieked and rushed up a cherry tree.Gon however stood his ground boldly and prepared to give battle for he felt that Komas eyes were upon him and that he must not run away. But alas his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once touched him for he was large and powerful and very fierce. From her perch in the tree Koma saw it all and screamed with all her might hoping that some one would hear and come to help. Luckily a servant of the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by and he drove off the dog and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms carried him to his mistress.So poor little Koma was left alone while Gon was borne away full of trouble not in the least knowing what to do. Even the attention paid him by the princess who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways did not console him but there was no use in fighting against fate and he could only wait and see what would turn up.The princess Gons new mistress was so good and kind that everybody loved her and she would have led a happy life had it not been for a serpent who had fallen in love with her and was constantly annoying her by his presence. Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as he appeared but as they were careless and the serpent very sly it sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them and to frighten the princess by appearing before her.One day she was seated in her room playing on her favourite musical instrument when she felt something gliding up her sash and saw her enemy making his way to kiss her cheek. She shrieked and threw herself backwards and Gon who had been curled up on a stool at her feet understood her terror and with one bound seized the snake by his neck. He gave him one bite and one shake and flung him on the ground where he lay never to worry the princess any more. Then she took Gon in her arms and praised and caressed him and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat and the softest mats to lie on and he would have had nothing in the world to wish for if only he could have seen Koma again.Time passed on and one morning Gon lay before the house door basking in the sun. He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and illtreating quite a little one. He jumped up full of rage and chased away the big cat and then he turned to comfort the little one when his heart nearly burst with joy to find that it was Koma. At first Koma did not know him again he had grown so large and stately but when it dawned upon her who it was her happiness knew no bounds. And they rubbed their heads and their noses again and again while their purring might have been heard a mile off.Paw in paw they appeared before the princess and told her the story of their life and its sorrows. The princess wept for sympathy and promised that they should never more be parted but should live with her to the end of their days. Byandbye the princess herself got married and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park. And she told him all about her two cats and how brave Gon had been and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent.And when the prince heard he swore they should never leave them but should go with the princess wherever she went. So it all fell out as the princess wished and Gon and Koma had many children and so had the princess and they all played together and were friends to the end of their lives.
It was the Feast of the New Year the oldest and most splendid of all the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia and the day had been spent by the king in the city of Schiraz taking part in the magnificent spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honor to the festival. The sun was setting and the monarch was about to give his court the signal to retire when suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne leading a horse richly harnessed and looking in every respect exactly like a real one.Sire said he prostrating himself as he spoke although I make my appearance so late before your Highness I can confidently assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day can be compared to this horse if you will deign to cast your eyes upon him.I see nothing in it replied the king except a clever imitation of a real one and any skilled workman might do as much.Sire returned the Indian it is not of his outward form that I would speak but of the use that I can make of him. I have only to mount him and to wish myself in some special place and no matter how distant it may be in a very few moments I shall find myself there. It is this Sire that makes the horse so marvellous and if your Highness will allow me you can prove it for yourself.The King of Persia who was interested in every thing out of the common and had never before come across a horse with such qualities bade the Indian mount the animal and show what he could do. In an instant the man had vaulted on his back and inquired where the monarch wished to send him.Do you see that mountain asked the king pointing to a huge mass that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot.The words were hardly out of the kings mouth when the Indian turned a screw placed in the horses neck close to the saddle and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air and was soon beyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes. In a quarter of an hour the Indian was seen returning bearing in his hand the palm and guiding his horse to the foot of the throne he dismounted and laid the leaf before the king.Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the horse was capable than he longed to possess it himself and indeed so sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to sell it that he looked upon it as his own already.I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was he remarked to the Indian and I am grateful to you for having shown me my error said he. If you will sell it name your own price.Sire replied the Indian I never doubted that a sovereign so wise and accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my horse when he once knew its power and I even went so far as to think it probable that you might wish to possess it. Greatly as I prize it I will yield it up to your Highness on one condition. The horse was not constructed by me but it was given me by the inventor in exchange for my only daughter who made me take a solemn oath that I would never part with it except for some object of equal value.Name anything you like cried the monarch interrupting him. My kingdom is large and filled with fair cities. You have only to choose which you would prefer to become its ruler to the end of your life.Sire answered the Indian to whom the proposal did not seem nearly so generous as it appeared to the king I am most grateful to your Highness for your princely offer and beseech you not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter.A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words and Prince Firouz Schah the heir apparent was filled with anger at the Indians presumption. The king however thought that it would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a delightful toy and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince broke in.Sire he said it is not possible that you can doubt for an instant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain. Consider what you owe to yourself and to the blood of your ancestors.My son replied the king you speak nobly but you do not realise either the value of the horse or the fact that if I reject the proposal of the Indian he will only make the same to some other monarch and I should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World. Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions and perhaps he may be brought to reason but meanwhile I should like you to examine the horse and with the owners permission to make trial of its powers.The Indian who had overheard the kings speech thought that he saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal so he joyfully agreed to the monarchs wishes and came forward to help the prince to mount the horse and show him how to guide it but before he had finished the young man turned the screw and was soon out of sight.They waited some time expecting that every moment he might be seen returning in the distance but at length the Indian grew frightened and prostrating himself before the throne he said to the king Sire your Highness must have noticed that the prince in his impatience did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order to return to the place from which he started. I implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault and not to visit on me any misfortune that may occur.But why cried the king in a burst of fear and anger why did you not call him back when you saw him disappearingSire replied the Indian the rapidity of his movements took me so by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my speech. But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth.But supposing he does answered the king what is to hinder the horse from descending straight into the sea or dashing him to pieces on the rocksHave no fears your Highness said the Indian the horse has the gift of passing over seas and of carrying his rider wherever he wishes to go.Well your head shall answer for it returned the monarch and if in three months he is not safe back with me or at any rate does not send me news of his safety your life shall pay the penalty. So saying he ordered his guards to seize the Indian and throw him into prison.Meanwhile Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up into the air and for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher till the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains. Then he began to think it was time to come down and took for granted that in order to do this it was only needful to turn the screw the reverse way but to his surprise and horror he found that turn as he might he did not make the smallest impression. He then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to get back to earth again and understood the danger in which he stood. Luckily he did not lose his head and set about examining the horses neck with great care till at last to his intense joy he discovered a tiny little peg much smaller than the other close to the right ear. This he turned and found himself dropping to the earth though more slowly than he had left it.It was now dark and as the prince could see nothing he was obliged not without some feeling of disquiet to allow the horse to direct his own course and midnight was already passed before Prince Firouz Schah again touched the ground faint and weary from his long ride and from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning.The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out where he was and as far as he could discover in the thick darkness he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace with a balustrade of marble running round. In one corner of the terrace stood a small door opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace.Some people might have hesitated before exploring further but not so the prince. I am doing no harm he said and whoever the owner may be he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed and in dread of making a false step he went cautiously down the staircase. On a landing he noticed an open door beyond which was a faintly lighted hall.Before entering the prince paused and listened but he heard nothing except the sound of men snoring. By the light of a lantern suspended from the roof he perceived a row of black guards sleeping each with a naked sword lying by him and he understood that the hall must form the anteroom to the chamber of some queen or princess.Standing quite still Prince Firouz Schah looked about him till his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom and he noticed a bright light shining through a curtain in one corner. He then made his way softly towards it and drawing aside its folds passed into a magnificent chamber full of sleeping women all lying on low couches except one who was on a sofa and this one he knew must be the princess.Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her and saw that she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld. But fascinated though he was he was well aware of the danger of his position as one cry of surprise would awake the guards and cause his certain death.So sinking quietly on his knees he took hold of the sleeve of the princess and drew her arm lightly towards him. The princess opened her eyes and seeing before her a handsome welldressed man she remained speechless with astonishment.This favorable moment was seized by the prince who bowing low while he knelt thus addressed herYou behold madame a prince in distress son to the King of Persia who owing to an adventure so strange that you will scarcely believe it finds himself here a suppliant for your protection. But yesterday I was in my fathers court engaged in the celebration of our most solemn festival today I am in an unknown land in danger of my life.Now the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah implored was the eldest daughter of the King of Bengal who was enjoying rest and change in the palace her father had built her at a little distance from the capital. She listened kindly to what he had to say and then answeredPrince be not uneasy hospitality and humanity are practised as widely in Bengal as they are in Persia. The protection you ask will be given you by all. You have my word for it. And as the prince was about to thank her for her goodness she added quickly However great may be my curiosity to learn by what means you have travelled here so speedily I know that you must be faint for want of food so I shall give orders to my women to take you to one of my chambers where you will be provided with supper and left to repose.By this time the princesss attendants were all awake and listening to the conversation. At a sign from their mistress they rose dressed themselves hastily and snatching up some of the tapers which lighted the room conducted the prince to a large and lofty room where two of the number prepared his bed and the rest went down to the kitchen from which they soon returned with all sorts of dishes. Then showing him cupboards filled with dresses and linen they quitted the room.During their absence the Princess of Bengal who had been greatly struck by the beauty of the prince tried in vain to go to sleep again. It was of no use she felt broad awake and when her women entered the room she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted and what they thought of him.Madame they replied it is of course impossible for us to tell what impression this young man has made on you. For ourselves we think you would be fortunate if the king your father should allow you to marry anyone so amiable. Certainly there is no one in the Court of Bengal who can be compared with him.These flattering observations were by no means displeasing to the princess but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she merely said You are all a set of chatterboxes go back to bed and let me sleep.When she dressed the following morning her maids noticed that contrary to her usual habit the princess was very particular about her toilette and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three times over. For she said to herself if my appearance was not displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was how much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all my charms.Then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamonds she could find with a necklace bracelets and girdle all of precious stones. And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the richest stuff in all the Indies that no one was allowed to wear except members of the royal family. When she was fully dressed according to her wishes she sent to know if the Prince of Persia was awake and ready to receive her as she desired to present herself before him.When the princesss messenger entered his room Prince Firouz Schah was in the act of leaving it to inquire if he might be allowed to pay his homage to her mistress but on hearing the princesss wishes he at once gave way. Her will is my law he said I am only here to obey her orders.In a few moments the princess herself appeared and after the usual compliments had passed between them the princess sat down on a sofa and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him an audience in her own apartments. Had I done so she said we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs who has the right to enter whenever it pleases him whereas this is forbidden ground. I am all impatience to learn the wonderful accident which has procured the pleasure of your arrival and that is why I have come to you here where no one can intrude upon us. Begin then I entreat you without delay.So the prince began at the beginning and told all the story of the festival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia and of the splendid spectacles celebrated in its honor. But when he came to the enchanted horse the princess declared that she could never have imagined anything half so surprising. Well then continued the prince you can easily understand how the King my father who has a passion for all curious things was seized with a violent desire to possess this horse and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it.The mans answer was absolutely absurd as you will agree when I tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess my sister but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked and I was beside myself with rage I saw to my despair that my father could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it deserved. I tried to argue with him but in vain. He only begged me to examine the horse with a view as I quite understood of making me more sensible of its value.To please my father I mounted the horse and without waiting for any instructions from the Indian turned the peg as I had seen him do. In an instant I was soaring upwards much quicker than an arrow could fly and I felt as if I must be getting so near the sky that I should soon hit my head against it I could see nothing beneath me and for some time was so confused that I did not even know in what direction I was travelling. At last when it was growing dark I found another screw and on turning it the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth. I was forced to trust to chance and to see what fate had in store and it was already past midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace. I crept down the little staircase and made directly for a light which I perceived through an open doorI peeped cautiously in and saw as you will guess the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor. I knew the risks I ran but my need was so great that I paid no attention to them and stole safely past your guards to the curtain which concealed your doorway.The rest Princess you know and it only remains for me to thank you for the kindness you have shown me and to assure you of my gratitude. By the law of nations I am already your slave and I have only my heart that is my own to offer you. But what am I saying My own Alas madame it was yours from the first moment I beheld youThe air with which he said these words could have left no doubt on the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms and the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty.Prince returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to speak you have given me the greatest pleasure and I have followed you closely in all your adventures and though you are positively sitting before me I even trembled at your danger in the upper regions of the air Let me say what a debt I owe to the chance that has led you to my house you could have entered none which would have given you a warmer welcome. As to your being a slave of course that is merely a joke and my reception must itself have assured you that you are as free here as at your fathers court. As to your heart continued she in tones of encouragement I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago to some princess who is well worthy of it and I could not think of being the cause of your unfaithfulness to her.Prince Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no lady with any prior claims but he was stopped by the entrance of one of the princesss attendants who announced that dinner was served and after all neither was sorry for the interruption.Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment and the table was covered with delicious fruits while during the repast richly dressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments. After the prince and princess had finished they passed into a small room hung with blue and gold looking out into a garden stocked with flowers and arbutus trees quite different from any that were to be found in Persia.Princess observed the young man till now I had always believed that Persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely gardens than any kingdom upon earth. But my eyes have been opened and I begin to perceive that wherever there is a great king he will surround himself with buildings worthy of him.Prince replied the Princess of Bengal I have no idea what a Persian palace is like so I am unable to make comparisons. I do not wish to depreciate my own palace but I can assure you that it is very poor beside that of the King my father as you will agree when you have been there to greet him as I hope you will shortly do.Now the princess hoped that by bringing about a meeting between the prince and her father the King would be so struck with the young mans distinguished air and fine manners that he would offer him his daughter to wife. But the reply of the Prince of Persia to her suggestion was not quite what she wished.Madame he said by taking advantage of your proposal to visit the palace of the King of Bengal I should satisfy not merely my curiosity but also the sentiments of respect with which I regard him. But Princess I am persuaded that you will feel with me that I cannot possibly present myself before so great a sovereign without the attendants suitable to my rank. He would think me an adventurer.If that is all she answered you can get as many attendants here as you please. There are plenty of Persian merchants and as for money my treasury is always open to you. Take what you please.Prince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on the part of the princess and was much touched by it. Still his passion which increased every moment did not make him forget his duty. So he replied without hesitationI do not know Princess how to express my gratitude for your obliging offer which I would accept at once if it were not for the recollection of all the uneasiness the King my father must be suffering on my account. I should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon me if I did not return to him at the first possible moment. For while I am enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses he is I am quite convinced plunged in the deepest grief having lost all hope of seeing me again. I am sure you will understand my position and will feel that to remain away one instant longer than is necessary would not only be ungrateful on my part but perhaps even a crime for how do I know if my absence may not break his heartBut continued the prince having obeyed the voice of my conscience I shall count the moments when with your gracious permission I may present myself before the King of Bengal not as a wanderer but as a prince to implore the favor of your hand. My father has always informed me that in my marriage I shall be left quite free but I am persuaded that I have only to describe your generosity for my wishes to become his own.The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanation offered by Prince Firouz Schah but she was much disturbed at his intention of departing at once for she feared that no sooner had he left her than the impression she had made on him would fade away. So she made one more effort to keep him and after assuring him that she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father begged him to give her a day or two more of his company.In common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this request and the princess set about inventing every kind of amusement for him and succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost unnoticed in balls spectacles and in hunting of which when unattended by danger the princess was passionately fond. But at last one day he declared seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer and entreated her to put no further obstacles in his way promising at the same time to return as soon as he could with all the magnificence due both to her and to himself.Princess he added it may be that in your heart you class me with those false lovers whose devotion cannot stand the test of absence. If you do you wrong me and were it not for fear of offending you I would beseech you to come with me for my life can only be happy when passed with you. As for your reception at the Persian Court it will be as warm as your merits deserve and as for what concerns the King of Bengal he must be much more indifferent to your welfare than you have led me to believe if he does not give his consent to our marriage.The princess could not find words in which to reply to the arguments of the Prince of Persia but her silence and her downcast eyes spoke for her and declared that she had no objection to accompanying him on his travels.The only difficulty that occurred to her was that Prince Firouz Schah did not know how to manage the horse and she dreaded lest they might find themselves in the same plight as before. But the prince soothed her fears so successfully that she soon had no other thought than to arrange for their flight so secretly that no one in the palace should suspect it.This was done and early the following morning when the whole palace was wrapped in sleep she stole up on to the roof where the prince was already awaiting her with his horses head towards Persia. He mounted first and helped the princess up behind then when she was firmly seated with her hands holding tightly to his belt he touched the screw and the horse began to leave the earth quickly behind him.He travelled with his accustomed speed and Prince Firouz Schah guided him so well that in two hours and a half from the time of starting he saw the capital of Persia lying beneath him. He determined to alight neither in the great square from which he had started nor in the Sultans palace but in a country house at a little distance from the town. Here he showed the princess a beautiful suite of rooms and begged her to rest while he informed his father of their arrival and prepared a public reception worthy of her rank. Then he ordered a horse to be saddled and set out.All the way through the streets he was welcomed with shouts of joy by the people who had long lost all hope of seeing him again. On reaching the palace he found the Sultan surrounded by his ministers all clad in the deepest mourning and his father almost went out of his mind with surprise and delight at the mere sound of his sons voice. When he had calmed down a little he begged the prince to relate his adventures.The prince at once seized the opening thus given him and told the whole story of his treatment by the Princess of Bengal not even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him. And Sire ended the prince having given my royal word that you would not refuse your consent to our marriage I persuaded her to return with me on the Indians horse. I have left her in one of your Highnesss country houses where she is waiting anxiously to be assured that I have not promised in vain.As he said this the prince was about to throw himself at the feet of the Sultan but his father prevented him and embracing him again said eagerlyMy son not only do I gladly consent to your marriage with the Princess of Bengal but I will hasten to pay my respects to her and to thank her in my own person for the benefits she has conferred on you. I will then bring her back with me and make all arrangements for the wedding to be celebrated today.So the Sultan gave orders that the habits of mourning worn by the people should be thrown off and that there should be a concert of drums trumpets and cymbals. Also that the Indian should be taken from prison and brought before him.His commands were obeyed and the Indian was led into his presence surrounded by guards. I have kept you locked up said the Sultan so that in case my son was lost your life should pay the penalty. He has now returned so take your horse and begone for ever.The Indian hastily quitted the presence of the Sultan and when he was outside he inquired of the man who had taken him out of prison where the prince had really been all this time and what he had been doing. They told him the whole story and how the Princess of Bengal was even then awaiting in the country palace the consent of the Sultan which at once put into the Indians head a plan of revenge for the treatment he had experienced. Going straight to the country house he informed the doorkeeper who was left in charge that he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of Persia to fetch the princess on the enchanted horse and to bring her to the palace.The doorkeeper knew the Indian by sight and was of course aware that nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison by the Sultan and seeing him at liberty the man took for granted that he was speaking the truth and made no difficulty about leading him before the Princess of Bengal while on her side hearing that he had come from the prince the lady gladly consented to do what he wished.The Indian delighted with the success of his scheme mounted the horse assisted the princess to mount behind him and turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving the palace in Schiraz for the country house followed closely by the Sultan and all the court. Knowing this the Indian deliberately steered the horse right above the city in order that his revenge for his unjust imprisonment might be all the quicker and sweeter.When the Sultan of Persia saw the horse and its riders he stopped short with astonishment and horror and broke out into oaths and curses which the Indian heard quite unmoved knowing that he was perfectly safe from pursuit. But mortified and furious as the Sultan was his feelings were nothing to those of Prince Firouz Schah when he saw the object of his passionate devotion being borne rapidly away. And while he was struck speechless with grief and remorse at not having guarded her better she vanished swiftly out of his sight. What was he to do Should he follow his father into the palace and there give reins to his despair Both his love and his courage alike forbade it and he continued his way to the palace.The sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of what folly he had been guilty and flinging himself at his masters feet implored his pardon. Rise said the prince I am the cause of this misfortune and not you. Go and find me the dress of a dervish but beware of saying it is for me.At a short distance from the country house a convent of dervishes was situated and the superior or scheih was the doorkeepers friend. So by means of a false story made up on the spur of the moment it was easy enough to get hold of a dervishs dress which the prince at once put on instead of his own. Disguised like this and concealing about him a box of pearls and diamonds he had intended as a present to the princess he left the house at nightfall uncertain where he should go but firmly resolved not to return without her.Meanwhile the Indian had turned the horse in such a direction that before many hours had passed it had entered a wood close to the capital of the kingdom of Cashmere. Feeling very hungry and supposing that the princess also might be in want of food he brought his steed down to the earth and left the princess in a shady place on the banks of a clear stream.At first when the princess had found herself alone the idea had occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself. But as she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left Bengal she felt she was too weak to venture far and was obliged to abandon her design. On the return of the Indian with meats of various kinds she began to eat voraciously and soon had regained sufficient courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks. Goaded by his threats she sprang to her feet calling loudly for help and luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen who rode up to inquire what was the matter.Now the leader of these horsemen was the Sultan of Cashmere returning from the chase and he instantly turned to the Indian to inquire who he was and whom he had with him. The Indian rudely answered that it was his wife and there was no occasion for anyone else to interfere between them.The princess who of course was ignorant of the rank of her deliverer denied altogether the Indians story. My lord she cried whoever you may be put no faith in this impostor. He is an abominable magician who has this day torn me from the Prince of Persia my destined husband and has brought me here on this enchanted horse. She would have continued but her tears choked her and the Sultan of Cashmere convinced by her beauty and her distinguished air of the truth of her tale ordered his followers to cut off the Indians head which was done immediately.But rescued though she was from one peril it seemed as if she had only fallen into another. The Sultan commanded a horse to be given her and conducted her to his own palace where he led her to a beautiful apartment and selected female slaves to wait on her and eunuchs to be her guard. Then without allowing her time to thank him for all he had done he bade her repose saying she should tell him her adventures on the following day.The princess fell asleep flattering herself that she had only to relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by compassion and to restore her to the prince without delay. But a few hours were to undeceive her.When the King of Cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before he had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princess becoming his wife and at daybreak proclamation of his intention was made throughout the town by the sound of drums trumpets cymbals and other instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy. The Princess of Bengal was early awakened by the noise but she did not for one moment imagine that it had anything to do with her till the Sultan arriving as soon as she was dressed to inquire after her health informed her that the trumpet blasts she heard were part of the solemn marriage ceremonies for which he begged her to prepare. This unexpected announcement caused the princess such terror that she sank down in a dead faint.The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid and the Sultan himself did his best to bring her back to consciousness but for a long while it was all to no purpose. At length her senses began slowly to come back to her and then rather than break faith with the Prince of Persia by consenting to such a marriage she determined to feign madness. So she began by saying all sorts of absurdities and using all kinds of strange gestures while the Sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise. But as this sudden seizure showed no sign of abating he left her to her women ordering them to take the greatest care of her. Still as the day went on the malady seemed to become worse and by night it was almost violent.Days passed in this manner till at last the Sultan of Cashmere decided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult together over her sad state. Their answer was that madness is of so many different kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion on the case without seeing the princess so the Sultan gave orders that they were to be introduced into her chamber one by one every man according to his rank.This decision had been foreseen by the princess who knew quite well that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse the most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectly good health and that her madness was feigned so as each man approached she broke out into such violent paroxysms that not one dared to lay a finger on her. A few who pretended to be cleverer than the rest declared that they could diagnose sick people only from sight ordered her certain potions which she made no difficulty about taking as she was persuaded they were all harmless.When the Sultan of Cashmere saw that the court doctors could do nothing towards curing the princess he called in those of the city who fared no better. Then he had recourse to the most celebrated physicians in the other large towns but finding that the task was beyond their science he finally sent messengers into the other neighbouring states with a memorandum containing full particulars of the princesss madness offering at the same time to pay the expenses of any physician who would come and see for himself and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her. In answer to this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into Cashmere but they naturally were not more successful than the rest had been as the cure depended neither on them nor their skill but only on the princess herself.It was during this time that Prince Firouz Schah wandering sadly and hopelessly from place to place arrived in a large city of India where he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of Bengal who had gone out of her senses on the very day that she was to have been married to the Sultan of Cashmere. This was quite enough to induce him to take the road to Cashmere and to inquire at the first inn at which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story. When he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he had so long lost he set about devising a plan for her rescue.The first thing he did was to procure a doctors robe so that his dress added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his travels might unmistakably proclaim his profession. He then lost no time in going to the palace where he obtained an audience of the chief usher and while apologising for his boldness in presuming to think that he could cure the princess where so many others had failed declared that he had the secret of certain remedies which had hitherto never failed of their effect.The chief usher assured him that he was heartily welcome and that the Sultan would receive him with pleasure and in case of success he would gain a magnificent reward.When the Prince of Persia in the disguise of a physician was brought before him the Sultan wasted no time in talking beyond remarking that the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into transports of rage. He then led the prince up to a room under the roof which had an opening through which he might observe the princess without himself being seen.The prince looked and beheld the princess reclining on a sofa with tears in her eyes singing softly to herself a song bewailing her sad destiny which had deprived her perhaps for ever of a being she so tenderly loved. The young mans heart beat fast as he listened for he needed no further proof that her madness was feigned and that it was love of him which had caused her to resort to this species of trick. He softly left his hidingplace and returned to the Sultan to whom he reported that he was sure from certain signs that the princesss malady was not incurable but that he must see her and speak with her alone.The Sultan made no difficulty in consenting to this and commanded that he should be ushered in to the princesss apartment. The moment she caught sight of his physicians robe she sprang from her seat in a fury and heaped insults upon him. The prince took no notice of her behavior and approaching quite close so that his words might be heard by her alone he said in a low whisper Look at me princess and you will see that I am no doctor but the Prince of Persia who has come to set you free.At the sound of his voice the Princess of Bengal suddenly grew calm and an expression of joy overspread her face such as only comes when what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly happens to us. For some time she was too enchanted to speak and Prince Firouz Schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her all that had occurred his despair at watching her disappear before his very eyes the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world and his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at Cashmere. When he had finished he begged in his turn that the princess would tell him how she had come there so that he might the better devise some means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the Sultan.It needed but a few words from the princess to make him acquainted with the whole situation and how she had been forced to play the part of a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage with the Sultan who had not had sufficient politeness even to ask her consent. If necessary she added she had resolved to die sooner than permit herself to be forced into such a union and break faith with a prince whom she loved.The prince then inquired if she knew what had become of the enchanted horse since the Indians death but the princess could only reply that she had heard nothing about it. Still she did not suppose that the horse could have been forgotten by the Sultan after all she had told him of its value.To this the prince agreed and they consulted together over a plan by which she might be able to make her escape and return with him into Persia. And as the first step she was to dress herself with care and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited her next morning.The Sultan was transported with delight on learning the result of the interview and his opinion of the doctors skill was raised still higher when on the following day the princess behaved towards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete cure would not be long delayed. However he contented himself with assuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician and to repose entire confidence in him. Then he retired without awaiting any reply from the princess.The Prince of Persia left the room at the same time and asked if he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the Princess of Bengal had reached Cashmere which was so far distant from her fathers kingdom and how she came to be there alone. The Sultan thought the question very natural and told him the same story that the Princess of Bengal had done adding that he had ordered the enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity though he was quite ignorant how it could be used.Sire replied the physician your Highnesss tale has supplied me with the clue I needed to complete the recovery of the princess. During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse a portion of its enchantment has by some means been communicated to her person and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which I possess the secret. If your Highness will deign to consent and to give the court and the people one of the most astonishing spectacles they have ever witnessed command the horse to be brought into the big square outside the palace and leave the rest to me. I promise that in a very few moments in presence of all the assembled multitude you shall see the princess as healthy both in mind and body as ever she was in her life. And in order to make the spectacle as impressive as possible I would suggest that she should be richly dressed and covered with the noblest jewels of the crown.The Sultan readily agreed to all that the prince proposed and the following morning he desired that the enchanted horse should be taken from the treasury and brought into the great square of the palace. Soon the rumour began to spread through the town that something extraordinary was about to happen and such a crowd began to collect that the guards had to be called out to keep order and to make a way for the enchanted horse.When all was ready the Sultan appeared and took his place on a platform surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of his court. When they were seated the Princess of Bengal was seen leaving the palace accompanied by the ladies who had been assigned to her by the Sultan. She slowly approached the enchanted horse and with the help of her ladies she mounted on its back. Directly she was in the saddle with her feet in the stirrups and the bridle in her hand the physician placed around the horse some large braziers full of burning coals into each of which he threw a perfume composed of all sorts of delicious scents. Then he crossed his hands over his breast and with lowered eyes walked three times round the horse muttering the while certain words. Soon there arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke which almost concealed both the horse and princess and this was the moment for which he had been waiting. Springing lightly up behind the lady he leaned forward and turned the peg and as the horse darted up into the air he cried aloud so that his words were heard by all present Sultan of Cashmere when you wish to marry princesses who have sought your protection learn first to gain their consent.It was in this way that the Prince of Persia rescued the Princess of Bengal and returned with her to Persia where they descended this time before the palace of the King himself. The marriage was only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as brilliant as possible and as soon as the rejoicings were over an ambassador was sent to the King of Bengal to inform him of what had passed and to ask his approbation of the alliance between the two countries which he heartily gave.
One winter a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it and taking it up placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth and resuming its natural instincts bit its benefactor inflicting on him a mortal wound. Oh cried the Farmer with his last breath I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.
There is a street in Copenhagen that has this strange nameHysken Strde. Whence comes this name and what is its meaning It is said to be German but injustice has been done to the Germans in this matter for it would have to be Huschen and not Hysken. For here stood once upon a time and indeed for a great many years a few little houses which were principally nothing more than wooden booths just as we see now in the marketplaces at fairtime. They were perhaps a little larger and had windows but the panes consisted of horn or bladder for glass was then too expensive to be used in every house. But then we are speaking of a long time agoso long since that grandfather and greatgrandfather when they talked about them used to speak of them as the old timesin fact it is several centuries ago.The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck carried on trade with Copenhagen. They did not reside in the town themselves but sent their clerks who lived in the wooden booths in the Huschen Street and sold beer and spices. The German beer was good and there were many kinds of it as there were for instance Bremen and Prussinger and Sous beer and even Brunswick mumm and quantities of spices were soldsaffron and aniseed and ginger and especially pepper. Yes pepper was the chief article here and so it happened that the German clerks got the nickname pepper gentry and there was a condition made with them in Lubeck and in Bremen that they would not marry at Copenhagen and many of them became very old. They had to care for themselves and to look after their own comforts and to put out their own fireswhen they had any and some of them became very solitary old boys with eccentric ideas and eccentric habits. From them all unmarried men who have attained a certain age are called in Denmark pepper gentry and this must be understood by all who wish to comprehend this history.The pepper gentleman becomes a butt for ridicule and is continually told that he ought to put on his nightcap and draw it down over his eyes and do nothing but sleep. The boys singCut cut woodPoor bachelor so good.Go take your nightcap go to restFor tis the nightcap suits you bestYes thats what they sing about the peppererthus they make game of the poor bachelor and his nightcap and turn it into ridicule just because they know very little about either. Ah that kind of nightcap no one should wish to earn And why notWe shall hear.the pepperers booth.In the old times the Housekin Street was not paved and the people stumbled out of one hole into another as in a neglected byeway and it was narrow too. The booths leaned side by side and stood so close together that in the summer time a sail was often stretched from one booth to its opposite neighbour on which occasion the fragrance of pepper saffron and ginger became doubly powerful. Behind the counters young men were seldom seen. The clerks were generally old boys but they did not look like what we should fancy them namely with wig and nightcap and plush smallclothes and with waistcoat and coat buttoned up to the chin. No grandfathers greatgrandfather may look like that and has been thus portrayed but the pepper gentry had no superfluous means and accordingly did not have their portraits taken though indeed it would be interesting now to have a picture of one of them as he stood behind the counter or went to church on holy days. His hat was highcrowned and broadbrimmed and sometimes one of the youngest clerks would mount a feather. The woollen shirt was hidden behind a broad linen collar the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin and the cloak hung loose over it and the trousers were tucked into the broadtoed shoes for the clerks did not wear stockings. In their girdles they sported a dinnerknife and spoon and a larger knife was placed there also for the defence of the owner and this weapon was often very necessary. Just so was Anthony one of the oldest clerks clad on high days and holy days except that instead of a highcrowned hat he wore a low bonnet and under it a knitted cap a regular nightcap to which he had grown so accustomed that it was always on his head and he had two of themnightcaps of course. The old fellow was a subject for a painter. He was as thin as a lath had wrinkles clustering round his eyes and mouth and long bony fingers and bushy grey eyebrows over the left eye hung quite a tuft of hair and that did not look very handsome though it made him very noticeable. People knew that he came from Bremen but that was not his native place though his master lived there. His own native place was in Thuringia the town of Eisenach close by the Wartburg. Old Anthony did not speak much of this but he thought of it all the more.The old clerks of the Huschen Street did not often come together. Each one remained in his booth which was closed early in the evening and then it looked dark enough in the street only a faint glimmer of light forced its way through the little hornpane in the roof and in the booth sat generally on his bed the old bachelor his German hymnbook in his hand singing an evening psalm in a low voice or he went about in the booth till late into the night and busied himself about all sorts of things. It was certainly not an amusing life. To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot nobody cares for you unless you happen to get in anybodys way.Often when it was dark night outside with snow and rain the place looked very gloomy and lonely. No lamps were to be seen with the exception of one solitary light hanging before the picture of the Virgin that was fastened against the wall. The plash of the water against the neighbouring rampart at the castle wharf could be plainly heard. Such evenings are long and dreary unless people devise some employment for themselves. There is not always packing or unpacking to do nor can the scales be polished or paper bags be made continually and failing these people should devise other employment for themselves. And that is just what old Anthony did for he used to mend his clothes and put pieces on his boots. When he at last sought his couch he used from habit to keep his nightcap on. He drew it down a little closer but soon he would push it up again to see if the light had been properly extinguished. He would touch it press the wick together and then lie down on the other side and draw his nightcap down again but then a doubt would come upon him if every coal in the little firepan below had been properly deadened and put outa tiny spark might have been left burning and might set fire to something and cause damage. And therefore he rose from his bed and crept down the ladder for it could scarcely be called a stair. And when he came to the firepan not a spark was to be discovered and he might just go back again. But often when he had gone half of the way back it would occur to him that the shutters might not be securely fastened yes then his thin legs must carry him downstairs once more. He was cold and his teeth chattered in his mouth when he crept back again to bed for the cold seems to become doubly severe when it knows it cannot stay much longer. He drew up the coverlet closer around him and pulled down the nightcap lower over his brows and turned his thoughts away from trade and from the labours of the day. But that did not procure him agreeable entertainment for now old thoughts came and put up their curtains and these curtains have sometimes pins in them with which one pricks oneself and one cries out Oh and they prick into ones flesh and burn so that the tears sometimes come into ones eyes and that often happened to old Anthonyhot tears. The largest pearls streamed forth and fell on the coverlet or on the floor and then they sounded as if one of his heartstrings had broken. Sometimes again they seemed to rise up in flame illuminating a picture of life that never faded out of his heart. If he then dried his eyes with his nightcap the tear and the picture were indeed crushed but the source of the tears remained and welled up afresh from his heart. The pictures did not come up in the order in which the scenes had occurred in reality for very often the most painful would come together then again the most joyful would come but these had the deepest shadows of all.The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged to be fine but the woods of Thuringia arose far more beautiful in the eyes of Anthony. More mighty and more venerable seemed to him the old oaks around the proud knightly castle where the creeping plants hung down over the stony blocks of the rock sweeter there bloomed the flowers of the apple tree than in the Danish land. This he remembered very vividly. A glittering tear rolled down over his cheek and in this tear he could plainly see two children playinga boy and a girl. The boy had red cheeks and yellow curling hair and honest blue eyes. He was the son of the merchant Anthonyit was himself. The little girl had brown eyes and black hair and had a bright clever look. She was the burgomasters daughter Molly. The two were playing with an apple. They shook the apple and heard the pips rattling in it. Then they cut the apple in two and each of them took a half they divided even the pips and ate them all but one which the little girl proposed that they should lay in the earth.Then you shall see she said what will come out. It will be something you dont at all expect. A whole apple tree will come out but not directly.And she put the pip in a flowerpot and both were very busy and eager about it. The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger and the little girl dropped the pip in it and they both covered it with earth.Now you must not take it out tomorrow to see if it has struck root said Molly. That wont do at all. I did it with my flowers but only twice. I wanted to see if they were growingand I didnt know any better thenand the plants withered.Anthony took away the flowerpot and every morning the whole winter through he looked at it but nothing was to be seen but the black earth. At length however the spring came and the sun shone warm again and two little green leaves came up out of the pot.Those are for me and Molly said the boy. Thats beautifulthats marvellously beautifulSoon a third leaf made its appearance. Whom did that represent Yes and there came another and yet another. Day by day and week by week they grew larger and the plant began to take the form of a real tree. And all this was now mirrored in a single tear which was wiped away and disappeared but it might come again from its source in the heart of old Anthony.In the neighbourhood of Eisenach a row of stony mountains rises up. One of these mountains is round in outline and lifts itself above the rest naked and without tree bush or grass. It is called the Venus Mount. In this mountain dwells Lady Venus one of the deities of the heathen times. She is also called Lady Holle and every child in and around Eisenach has heard about her. She it was who lured Tannhauser the noble knight and minstrel from the circle of the singers of the Wartburg into her mountain.Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain and once Molly saidYou may knock and say Lady Holle open the doorTannhauser is hereBut Anthony did not dare. Molly however did it though she only said the words Lady Holle Lady Holle aloud and distinctly the rest she muttered so indistinctly that Anthony felt convinced she had not really said anything and yet she looked as bold and saucy as possibleas saucy as when she sometimes came round him with other little girls in the garden and all wanted to kiss him because he did not like to be kissed and tried to keep them off and she was the only one who dared to kiss him in spite of his resistance.I may kiss him she would say proudly.That was her vanity and Anthony submitted and thought no more about it.How charming and how teasing Molly was It was said that Lady Holle in the mountain was beautiful also but that her beauty was like that of a tempting fiend. The greatest beauty and grace was possessed by Saint Elizabeth the patron of the country the pious Princess of Thuringia whose good actions have been immortalized in many places in legends and stories. In the chapel her picture was hanging surrounded by silver lamps but it was not in the least like Molly.The apple tree which the two children had planted grew year by year and became taller and tallerso tall that it had to be transplanted into the garden into the fresh air where the dew fell and the sun shone warm. And the tree developed itself strongly so that it could resist the winter. And it seemed as if after the rigour of the cold season was past it put forth blossoms in spring for very joy. In the autumn it brought two applesone for Molly and one for Anthony. It could not well have produced less.The tree had grown apace and Molly grew like the tree. She was as fresh as an appleblossom but Anthony was not long to behold this flower. All things change Mollys father left his old home and Molly went with him far away. Yes in our time steam has made the journey they took a matter of a few hours but then more than a day and a night were necessary to go so far eastward from Eisenach to the furthest border of Thuringia to the city which is still called Weimar.And Molly wept and Anthony wept but all their tears melted into one and this tear had the rosy charming hue of joy. For Molly told him she loved himloved him more than all the splendours of Weimar.One two three years went by and during this period two letters were received. One came by a carrier and a traveller brought the other. The way was long and difficult and passed through many windings by towns and villages.Often had Molly and Anthony heard of Tristram and Iseult and often had the boy applied the story to himself and Molly though the name Tristram was said to mean born in tribulation and that did not apply to Anthony nor would he ever be able to think like Tristram She has forgotten me. But indeed Iseult did not forget her faithful knight and when both were laid to rest in the earth one on each side of the church the linden trees grew from their graves over the church roof and there encountered each other in bloom. Anthony thought that was beautiful but mournful but it could not become mournful between him and Molly and he whistled a song of the old minnesinger Walter of the VogelverdeUnder the lindensUpon the heath.And especially that passage appeared charming to himFrom the forest down in the valeSang her sweet song the nightingale.This song was often in his mouth and he sang and whistled it in the moonlight nights when he rode along the deep hollow way on horseback to get to Weimar and visit Molly. He wished to come unexpectedly and he came unexpectedly.He was made welcome with full goblets of wine with jovial company fine company and a pretty room and a good bed were provided for him and yet his reception was not what he had dreamt and fancied it would be. He could not understand himselfhe could not understand the others but we can understand it. One may be admitted into a house and associate with a family without becoming one of them. One may converse together as one would converse in a postcarriage and know one another as people know each other on a journey each incommoding the other and wishing that either oneself or the good neighbour were away. Yes this was the kind of thing Anthony felt.I am an honest girl said Molly and I myself will tell you what it is. Much has changed since we were children togetherchanged inwardly and outwardly. Habit and will have no power over our hearts. Anthony I should not like to have an enemy in you now that I shall soon be far away from here. Believe me I entertain the best wishes for you but to feel for you what I know now one may feel for a man has never been the case with me. You must reconcile yourself to this. Farewell AnthonyAnd Anthony bade her farewell. No tear came into his eye but he felt that he was no longer Mollys friend. Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips and we have the same feeling when we kiss it and he kissed himself into hatred as into love.Within twentyfour hours Anthony was back in Eisenach though certainly the horse on which he rode was ruined.What matter he said I am ruined too and I will destroy everything that can remind me of her or of Lady Holle or Venus the heathen woman I will break down the apple tree and tear it up by the roots so that it shall never bear flower or fruit moreBut the apple tree was not broken down though he himself was broken down and bound on a couch by fever. What was it that raised him up again A medicine was presented to him which had strength to do thisthe bitterest of medicines that shakes up body and spirit together. Anthonys father ceased to be the richest of merchants. Heavy daysdays of trialwere at the door misfortune came rolling into the house like great waves of the sea. The father became a poor man. Sorrow and suffering took away his strength. Then Anthony had to think of something else besides nursing his lovesorrows and his anger against Molly. He had to take his fathers placeto give orders to help to act energetically and at last to go out into the world and earn his bread.Anthony went to Bremen. There he learned what poverty and hard living meant and these sometimes make the heart hard and sometimes soften it even too much.How different the world was and how different the people were from what he had supposed them to be in his childhood What were the minnesingers songs to him nowan echo a vanishing sound Yes that is what he thought sometimes but again the songs would sound in his soul and his heart became gentle.Gods will is best he would say then. It was well that I was not permitted to keep Mollys heartthat she did not remain true to me. What would it have led to now when fortune has turned away from me She quitted me before she knew of this loss of prosperity or had any notion of what awaited me. That was a mercy of Providence towards me. Everything has happened for the best. It was not her faultand I have been so bitter and have shown so much rancour towards herAnd years went by. Anthonys father was dead and strangers lived in the old house. But Anthony was destined to see it again. His rich employer sent him on commercial journeys and his duty led him into his native town of Eisenach. The old Wartburg stood unchanged on the mountain with the monk and the nun hewn out in stone. The great oaks gave to the scene the outlines it had possessed in childish days. The Venus Mount glimmered grey and naked over the valley. He would have been glad to cry Lady Holle Lady Holle unlock the door and I shall enter and remain in my native earthThat was a sinful thought and he blessed himself to drive it away. Then a little bird out of the thicket sang clearly and the old minnesong came into his mindFrom the forest down in the valeSang her sweet song the nightingale.And here in the town of his childhood which he thus saw again through tears much came back into his remembrance. The paternal house stood as in the old times but the garden was altered and a fieldpath led over a portion of the old ground and the apple tree that he had not broken down stood there but outside the garden on the farther side of the path. But the sun threw its rays on the apple tree as in the old days the dew descended gently upon it as then and it bore such a burden of fruit that the branches were bent down towards the earth.That flourishes he said. The tree can growNevertheless one of the branches of the tree was broken. Mischievous hands had torn it down towards the ground for now the tree stood by the public way.They break its blossoms off without a feeling of thankfulnessthey steal its fruit and break the branches. One might say of the tree as has been said of some menIt was not sung at his cradle that it should come thus. How brightly its history began and what has it come to Forsaken and forgottena garden tree by the hedge in the field and on the public way There it stands unprotected plundered and broken It has certainly not died but in the course of years the number of blossoms will diminish at last the fruit will cease altogether and at lastat last all will be overSuch were Anthonys thoughts under the tree such were his thoughts during many a night in the lonely chamber of the wooden house in the distant landin the Huschen Street in Copenhagen whither his rich employer the Bremen merchant had sent him first making it a condition that he should not marry.Marry Ha ha he laughed bitterly to himself.Winter had set in early it was freezing hard. Without a snowstorm was raging so that every one who could do so remained at home thus too it happened that those who lived opposite to Anthony did not notice that for two days his house had not been unlocked and that he did not show himself for who would go out unnecessarily in such weatherThey were grey gloomy days and in the house whose windows were not of glass twilight only alternated with dark night. Old Anthony had not left his bed during the two days for he had not the strength to rise he had for a long time felt in his limbs the hardness of the weather. Forsaken by all lay the old bachelor unable to help himself. He could scarcely reach the waterjug that he had placed by his bedside and the last drop it contained had been consumed. It was not fever nor sickness but old age that had struck him down. Up yonder where his couch was placed he was overshadowed as it were by continual night. A little spider which however he could not see busily and cheerfully span its web around him as if it were weaving a little crape banner that should wave when the old man closed his eyes.The time was very slow and long and dreary. Tears he had none to shed nor did he feel pain. The thought of Molly never came into his mind. He felt as if the world and its noise concerned him no longeras if he were lying outside the world and no one were thinking of him. For a moment he felt a sensation of hungerof thirst. Yes he felt them both. But nobody came to tend himnobody. He thought of those who had once suffered want of Saint Elizabeth as she had once wandered on earth of her the saint of his home and of his childhood the noble Duchess of Thuringia the benevolent lady who had been accustomed to visit the lowliest cottages bringing to the inmates refreshment and comfort. Her pious deeds shone bright upon his soul. He thought of her as she had come to distribute words of comfort binding up the wounds of the afflicted giving meat to the hungry though her stern husband had chidden her for it. He thought of the legend told of her how she had been carrying the full basket containing food and wine when her husband who watched her footsteps came forth and asked angrily what she was carrying whereupon she answered in fear and trembling that the basket contained roses which she had plucked in the garden how he had torn away the white cloth from the basket and a miracle had been performed for the pious lady for bread and wine and everything in the basket had been transformed into rosesThus the saints memory dwelt in Anthonys quiet mind thus she stood bodily before his downcast face before his warehouse in the simple booth in the Danish land. He uncovered his head and looked into her gentle eyes and everything around him was beautiful and roseate. Yes the roses seemed to unfold themselves in fragrance. There came to him a sweet peculiar odour of apples and he saw a blooming apple tree which spread its branches above himit was the tree which Molly and he had planted together.And the tree strewed down its fragrant leaves upon him cooling his burning brow. The leaves fell upon his parched lips and were like strengthening bread and wine and they fell upon his breast and he felt reassured and calm and inclined to sleep peacefully.Now I shall sleep he whispered to himself. Sleep is refreshing. Tomorrow I shall be upon my feet again and strong and wellglorious wonderful That apple tree planted in true affection now stands before me in heavenly radianceAnd he slept.The day afterwardsit was the third day that his shop had remained closedthe snowstorm had ceased and a neighbour from the opposite house came over towards the booth where dwelt old Anthony who had not yet shown himself. Anthony lay stretched upon his beddeadwith his old cap clutched tightly in his two hands They did not put that cap on his head in his coffin for he had a new white one.Where were now the tears that he had wept What had become of the pearls They remained in the nightcapand the true ones do not come out in the washthey were preserved in the nightcap and in time forgotten but the old thoughts and the old dreams still remained in the bachelors nightcap. Dont wish for such a cap for yourself. It would make your forehead very hot would make your pulse beat feverishly and conjure up dreams which appear like reality. The first who wore that identical cap afterwards felt all that at once though it was half a century afterwards and that man was the burgomaster himself who with his wife and eleven children was well and firmly established and had amassed a very tolerable amount of wealth. He was immediately seized with dreams of unfortunate love of bankruptcy and of heavy times.Hallo how the nightcap burns he cried out and tore it from his head.And a pearl rolled out and another and another and they sounded and glittered.This must be gout said the burgomaster. Something dazzles my eyesThey were tears shed half a century before by old Anthony from Eisenach.Every one who afterwards put that nightcap upon his head had visions and dreams which excited him not a little. His own history was changed into that of Anthony and became a story in fact many stories. But some one else may tell them. We have told the first. And our last word isdont wish for The Old Bachelors Nightcap.
At the time that the Tang dynasty was reigning there lived a man named Liu I who had failed to pass his examinations for the doctorate. So he traveled home again. He had gone six or seven miles when a bird flew up in a field and his horse shied and ran ten miles before he could stop him. There he saw a woman who was herding sheep on a hillside. He looked at her and she was lovely to look upon yet her face bore traces of hidden grief. Astonished he asked her what was the matter.The woman began to sob and said Fortune has forsaken me and I am in need and ashamed. Since you are kind enough to ask I will tell you all. I am the youngest daughter of the DragonKing of the Sea of Dungting and was married to the second son of the DragonKing of Ging Dschou. Yet my husband illtreated and disowned me. I complained to my stepparents but they loved their son blindly and did nothing. And when I grew insistent they both became angry and I was sent out here to herd sheep. When she had done the woman burst into tears and lost all control of herself. Then she continued The Sea of Dungting is far from here yet I know that you will have to pass it on your homeward journey. I should like to give you a letter to my father but I do not know whether you would take it.Liu I answered Your words have moved my heart. Would that I had wings and could fly away with you. I will be glad to deliver the letter to your father. Yet the Sea of Dungting is long and broad and how am I to find himOn the southern shore of the Sea stands an orangetree answered the woman which people call the tree of sacrifice. When you get there you must loosen your girdle and strike the tree with it three times in succession. Then some one will appear whom you must follow. When you see my father tell him in what need you found me and that I long greatly for his help.Then she fetched out a letter from her breast and gave it to Liu I. She bowed to him looked toward the east and sighed and unexpectedly the sudden tears rolled from the eyes of Liu I as well. He took the letter and thrust it in his bag.Then he asked her I cannot understand why you have to herd sheep. Do the gods slaughter cattle like menThese are not ordinary sheep answered the woman these are rainsheep.But what are rainsheepThey are the thunderrams replied the woman.And when he looked more closely he noticed that these sheep walked around in proud savage fashion quite different from ordinary sheep.Liu I added But if I deliver the letter for you and you succeed in getting back to the Sea of Dungting in safety then you must not use me like a stranger.The woman answered How could I use you as a stranger You shall be my dearest friend.And with these words they parted.In course of a month Liu I reached the Sea of Dungting asked for the orangetree and sure enough found it. He loosened his girdle and struck the tree with it three times. At once a warrior emerged from the waves of the sea and asked Whence come you honored guestLiu I said I have come on an important mission and want to see the King.The warrior made a gesture in the direction of the water and the waves turned into a solid street along which he led Liu I. The dragoncastle rose before them with its thousand gates and magic flowers and rare grasses bloomed in luxurious profusion. The warrior bade him wait at the side of a great hall.Liu I asked What is this place calledIt is the Hall of the Spirits was the reply.Liu I looked about him all the jewels known to earth were there in abundance. The columns were of white quartz inlaid with green jade the seats were made of coral the curtains of mountain crystal as clear as water the windows of burnished glass adorned with rich latticework. The beams of the ceiling ornamented with amber rose in wide arches. An exotic fragrance filled the hall whose outlines were lost in darkness.Liu I had waited for the king a long time. To all his questions the warrior replied Our master is pleased at this moment to talk with the priest of the sun up on the coraltower about the sacred book of the fire. He will no doubt soon be through.Liu I went on to ask Why is he interested in the sacred book of the fireThe reply was Our master is a dragon. The dragons are powerful through the power of water. They can cover hill and dale with a single wave. The priest is a human being. Human beings are powerful through fire. They can burn the greatest palaces by means of a torch. Fire and water fight each other being different in their nature. For that reason our master is now talking with the priest in order to find a way in which fire and water may complete each other.Before they had quite finished there appeared a man in a purple robe bearing a scepter of jade in his hand.The warrior said This is my masterLiu I bowed before him.The king asked Are you not a living human being What has brought you hereLiu I gave his name and explained I have been to the capital and there failed to pass my examination. When I was passing by the Ging Dschou River I saw your daughter whom you love herding sheep in the wilderness. The winds tousled her hair and the rain drenched her. I could not bear to see her trouble and spoke to her. She complained that her husband had cast her out and wept bitterly. Then she gave me a letter for you. And that is why I have come to visit you O KingWith these words he fetched out his letter and handed it to the king. When the latter had read it he hid his face in his sleeve and said with a sigh It is my own fault. I picked out a worthless husband for her. Instead of securing her happiness I have brought her to shame in a distant land. You are a stranger and yet you have been willing to help her in her distress for which I am very grateful to you. Then he once more began to sob and all those about him shed tears. Thereupon the monarch gave the letter to a servant who took it into the interior of the palace and soon the sound of loud lamentations rose from the inner rooms.The king was alarmed and turned to an official Go and tell them within not to weep so loudly I am afraid that Tsian Tang may hear them.Who is Tsian Tang asked Liu I.He is my beloved brother answered the king. Formerly he was the ruler of the TsianTang River but now he has been deposed.Liu I asked Why should the matter be kept from himHe is so wild and uncontrollable was the reply that I fear he would cause great damage. The deluge which covered the earth for nine long years in the time of the Emperor Yau was the work of his anger. Because he fell out with one of the kings of heaven he caused a great deluge that rose and covered the tops of five high mountains. Then the king of heaven grew angry with him and gave him to me to guard. I had to chain him to a column in my palace.Before he had finished speaking a tremendous turmoil arose which split the skies and made the earth tremble so that the whole palace began to rock and smoke and clouds rose hissing and puffing. A red dragon a thousand feet long with flashing eyes bloodred tongue scarlet scales and a fiery beard came surging up. He was dragging along through the air the column to which he had been bound together with its chain. Thunders and lightnings roared and darted around his body sleet and snow rain and hailstones whirled about him in confusion. There was a crash of thunder and he flew up to the skies and disappeared.Liu I fell to earth in terror. The king helped him up with his own hand and said Do not be afraid That is my brother who is hastening to Ging Dschou in his rage. We will soon have good newsThen he had food and drink brought in for his guest. When the goblet had thrice made the rounds a gentle breeze began to murmur and a fine rain fell. A youth clad in a purple gown and wearing a lofty hat entered. A sword hung at his side. His appearance was manly and heroic. Behind him walked a girl radiantly beautiful wearing a robe of misty fragrance. And when Liu I looked at her lo it was the dragonprincess whom he had met on his way A throng of maidens in rosy garments received her laughing and giggling and led her into the interior of the palace. The king however presented Liu I to the youth and said This is Tsian Tang my brotherTsian Tang thanked him for having brought the message. Then he turned to his brother and said I have fought against the accursed dragons and have utterly defeated themHow many did you slaySix hundred thousand.Were any fields damagedThe fields were damaged for eight hundred miles around.And where is the heartless husbandI ate him aliveThen the king was alarmed and said What the fickle boy did was not to be endured it is true. But still you were a little too rough with him in future you must not do anything of the sort again. And Tsian Tang promised not to.That evening Liu I was feasted at the castle. Music and dancing lent charm to the banquet. A thousand warriors with banners and spears in their hands stood at attention. Trombones and trumpets resounded and drums and kettledrums thundered and rattled as the warriors danced a wardance. The music expressed how Tsian Tang had broken through the ranks of the enemy and the hair of the guest who listened to it rose on his head in terror. Then again there was heard the music of strings flutes and little golden bells. A thousand maidens in crimson and green silk danced around. The return of the princess was also told in tones. The music sounded like a song of sadness and plaining and all who heard it were moved to tears. The King of the Sea of Dungting was filled with joy. He raised his goblet and drank to the health of his guest and all sorrow departed from them. Both rulers thanked Liu I in verses and Liu I answered them in a rimed toast. The crowd of courtiers in the palacehall applauded. Then the King of the Sea of Dungting drew forth a blue cloudcasket in which was the horn of a rhinoceros which divides the water. Tsian Tang brought out a platter of red amber on which lay a carbuncle. These they presented to their guest and the other inmates of the palace also heaped up embroideries brocades and pearls by his side. Surrounded by shimmer and light Liu I sat there smiling and bowed his thanks to all sides. When the banquet was ended he slept in the Palace of Frozen Radiance.On the following day another banquet was held. Tsian Tang who was not quite himself sat carelessly on his seat and said The Princess of the Dungting Sea is handsome and delicately fashioned. She has had the misfortune to be disowned by her husband and today her marriage is annulled. I should like to find another husband for her. If you were agreeable it would be to your advantage. But if you were not willing to marry her you may go your way and should we ever meet again we will not know each other.Liu I was angered by the careless way in which Tsian Tang spoke to him. The blood rose to his head and he replied I served as a messenger because I felt sorry for the princess but not in order to gain an advantage for myself. To kill a husband and carry off a wife is something an honest man does not do. And since I am only an ordinary man I prefer to die rather than do as you say.Tsian Tang rose apologized and said My words were overhasty. I hope you will not take them ill And the King of the Dungting Sea also spoke kindly to him and censured Tsian Tang because of his rude speech. So there was no more said about marriage.On the following day Liu I took his leave and the Queen of the Dungting Sea gave a farewell banquet in his honor.With tears the queen said to Liu I My daughter owes you a great debt of gratitude and we have not had an opportunity to make it up to you. Now you are going away and we see you go with heavy heartsThen she ordered the princess to thank Liu I.The princess stood there blushing bowed to him and said We will probably never see each other again Then tears choked her voice.It is true that Liu I had resisted the stormy urging of her uncle but when he saw the princess standing before him in all the charm of her loveliness he felt sad at heart yet he controlled himself and went his way. The treasures which he took with him were incalculable. The king and his brother themselves escorted him as far as the river.When on his return home he sold no more than a hundredth part of what he had received his fortune already ran into the millions and he was wealthier than all his neighbors. He decided to take a wife and heard of a widow who lived in the North with her daughter. Her father had become a Taoist in his later years and had vanished in the clouds without ever returning. The mother lived in poverty with the daughter yet since the girl was beautiful beyond measure she was seeking a distinguished husband for her.Liu I was content to take her and the day of the wedding was set. And when he saw his bride unveiled on the evening of her wedding day she looked just like the dragonprincess. He asked her about it but she merely smiled and said nothing.After a time heaven sent them a son. Then she told her husband Today I will confess to you that I am truly the Princess of Dungting Sea. When you had rejected my uncles proposal and gone away I fell ill of longing and was near death. My parents wanted to send for you but they feared you might take exception to my family. And so it was that I married you disguised as a human maiden. I had not ventured to tell you until now but since heaven has sent us a son I hope that you will love his mother as well.Then Liu I awoke as though from a deep sleep and from that time on both were very fond of each other.One day his wife said If you wish to stay with me eternally then we cannot continue to dwell in the world of men. We dragons live ten thousand years and you shall share our longevity. Come back with me to the Sea of DungtingTen years passed and no one knew where Liu I who had disappeared might be. Then by accident a relative went sailing across the Sea of Dungting. Suddenly a blue mountain rose up out of the water.The seamen cried in alarm There is no mountain on this spot It must be a waterdemonWhile they were still pointing to it and talking the mountain drew near the ship and a gailycolored boat slid from its summit into the water. A man sat in the middle and fairies stood at either side of him. The man was Liu I. He beckoned to his cousin and the latter drew up his garments and stepped into the boat with him. But when he had entered the boat it turned into a mountain. On the mountain stood a splendid castle and in the castle stood Liu I surrounded with radiance and with the music of stringed instruments floating about him.They greeted each other and Liu I said to his cousin We have been parted no more than a moment and your hair is already grayHis cousin answered You are a god and blessed I have only a mortal body. Thus fate has decreed.Then Liu I gave him fifty pills and said Each pill will extend your life for the space of a year. When you have lived the tale of these years come to me and dwell no longer in the earthly world of dust where there is nothing but toil and trouble.Then he took him back across the sea and disappeared.His cousin however retired from the world and fifty years later and when he had taken all the pills he disappeared and was never seen again.Note The outcast princess is represented as herding sheep. In Chinese the word sheep is often used as an image for clouds. Sheep and goats are designated by the same word in Chinese. Tsian Tang is the name of a place used for the name of the god of that place. The deluge is the flood which the great Yu regulated as minister of the Emperor Yau. It is here represented in an exaggerated sense as a deluge.
Once upon a time there reigned a king who had an only daughter. The girl had been spoiled by everybody from her birth and besides being beautiful was clever and wilful and when she grew old enough to be married she refused to have anything to say to the prince whom her father favoured but declared she would choose a husband for herself. By long experience the king knew that when once she had made up her mind there was no use expecting her to change it so he inquired meekly what she wished him to do.Summon all the young men in the kingdom to appear before me a month from today answered the princess and the one to whom I shall give this golden apple shall be my husband.But my dear   began the king in tones of dismay.The one to whom I shall give this golden apple shall be my husband repeated the princess in a louder voice than before. And the king understood the signal and with a sigh proceeded to do her bidding.The young men arrived  tall and short dark and fair rich and poor. They stood in rows in the great courtyard in front of the palace and the princess clad in robes of green with a golden veil flowing behind her passed before them all holding the apple. Once or twice she stopped and hesitated but in the end she always passed on till she came to a youth near the end of the last row. There was nothing specially remarkable about him the bystanders thought nothing that was likely to take a girls fancy. A hundred others were handsomer and all wore finer clothes but he met the princesss eyes frankly and with a smile and she smiled too and held out the apple.The princess chooses. Illustration by H.J. Ford published in The Olive Fairy Book by Andrew Lang 1907 Longmans Green and Company.There is some mistake cried the king who had anxiously watched her progress and hoped that none of the candidates would please her. It is impossible that she can wish to marry the son of a poor widow who has not a farthing in the world  Tell her that I will not hear of it and that she must go through the rows again and fix upon someone else and the princess went through the rows a second and a third time and on each occasion she gave the apple to the widows son. Well marry him if you will exclaimed the angry king but at least you shall not stay here. And the princess answered nothing but threw up her head and taking the widows son by the hand they left the castle.That evening they were married and after the ceremony went back to the house of the bridegrooms mother which in the eyes of the princess did not look much bigger than a hencoop.The old woman was not at all pleased when her son entered bringing his bride with him.As if we were not poor enough before grumbled she. I dare say this is some fine lady who can do nothing to earn her living. But the princess stroked her arm and said softlyDo not be vexed dear mother I am a famous spinner and can sit at my wheel all day without breaking a thread.And she kept her word but in spite of the efforts of all three they became poorer and poorer and at the end of six months it was agreed that the husband should go to the neighbouring town to get work. Here he met a merchant who was about to start on a long journey with a train of camels laden with goods of all sorts and needed a man to help him. The widows son begged that he would take him as a servant and to this the merchant assented giving him his whole years salary beforehand. The young man returned home with the news and next day bade farewell to his mother and his wife who were very sad at parting from him.Do not forget me while you are absent whispered the princess as she flung her arms round his neck and as you pass by the well which lies near the city gate stop and greet the old man you will find sitting there. Kiss his hand and then ask him what counsel he can give you for your journey.Then the youth set out and when he reached the well where the old man was sitting he asked the questions as his wife had bidden him.My son replied the old man you have done well to come to me and in return remember three thingsShe whom the heart loves is ever the most beautiful. Patience is the first step on the road to happiness. He wins who waits. The young man thanked him and went on his way. Next morning early the caravan set out and before sunset it had arrived at the first halting place round some wells where another company of merchants had already encamped. But no rain had fallen for a long while in that rocky country and both men and beasts were parched with thirst. To be sure there was another well about half a mile away where there was always water but to get it you had to be lowered deep down and besides no one who had ever descended that well had been known to come back.However till they could store some water in their bags of goatskin the caravans dared not go further into the desert and on the night of the arrival of the widows son and his master the merchants had decided to offer a large reward to anyone who was brave enough to go down into the enchanted well and bring some up.Thus it happened that at sunrise the young man was aroused from his sleep by a herald making his round of the camp proclaiming that every merchant present would give a thousand piastres to the man who would risk his life to bring water for themselves and their camels.The youth hesitated for a little while when he heard the proclamation. The story of the well had spread far and wide and long ago had reached his ears. The danger was great he knew but then if he came back alive he would be the possessor of eighty thousand piastres. He turned to the herald who was passing the tentI will go said he.What madness  cried his master who happened to be standing near. You are too young to throw away your life like that. Run after the herald and tell him you take back your offer. But the young man shook his head and the merchant saw that it was useless to try and persuade him.Well it is your own affair he observed at last. If you must go you must. Only if you ever return I will give you a camels load of goods and my best mule besides. And touching his turban in token of farewell he entered the tent.Hardly had he done so than a crowd of men were seen pouring out of the camp.How can we thank you  they exclaimed pressing round the youth. Our camels as well as ourselves are almost dead of thirst. See here is the rope we have brought to let you down.Come then answered the youth. And they all set out.On reaching the well the rope was knotted securely under his arms a big goatskin bottle was given him and he was gently lowered to the bottom of the pit. Here a clear stream was bubbling over the rocks and stooping down he was about to drink when a huge Arab appeared before him saying in a loud voiceCome with me The young man rose never doubting that his last hour had come but as he could do nothing he followed the Arab into a brilliantly lighted hail on the further side of the little river. There his guide sat down and drawing towards him two boys he said to the strangerI have a question to ask you. If you answer it right your life shall be spared. If not your head will be forfeit as the head of many another has been before you. Tell me  which of my two children do I think the handsomer The question did not seem hard for while one boy was as beautiful a child as ever was seen his brother was ugly. But just as the youth was going to speak the old mans counsel flashed into the youths mind and he replied hastily The one whom we love best is always the handsomest.You have saved me  cried the Arab rising quickly from his seat and pressing the young man in his arms. Ah  if you could only guess what I have suffered from the stupidity of all the people to whom I have put that question and I was condemned by a wicked genius to remain here until it was answered  But what brought you to this place and how can I reward you for what you have done for me By helping me to draw enough water for my caravan of eighty merchants and their camels who are dying for want of it replied the youth.That is easily done said the Arab. Take these three apples and when you have filled your skin and are ready to be drawn up lay one of them on the ground. Halfway to the earth let fall another and at the top drop the third. If you follow my directions no harm will happen to you. And take besides these three pomegranates green red and white. One day you will find a use for them The young man did as he was told and stepped out on the rocky waste where the merchants were anxiously awaiting him. Oh how thirsty they all were But even after the camels had drunk the skin seemed as full as ever.Full of gratitude for their deliverance the merchants pressed the money into his hands while his own master bade him choose what goods he liked and a mule to carry them. So the widows son was rich at last and when the merchant had sold his merchandise and returned home to his native city his servant hired a man by whom he sent the money and the mule back to his wife.I will send the pomegranates also thought he for if I leave them in my turban they may some day fall out and he drew them out of his turban. But the fruit had vanished and in their places were three precious stones green white and red.For a long time he remained with the merchant who gradually trusted him with all his business and gave him a large share of the money he made. When his master died the young man wished to return home but the widow begged him to stay and help her and one day he awoke with a start to remember that twenty years had passed since he had gone away.I want to see my wife he said next morning to his mistress. If at any time I can be of use to you send a messenger to me meanwhile I have told Hassan what to do. And mounting a camel he set out.Now soon after he had taken service with the merchant a little boy had been born to him and both the princess and the old woman toiled hard all day to get the baby food and clothing. When the money and the pomegranates arrived there was no need for them to work any more and the princess saw at once that they were not fruit at all but precious stones of great value. The old woman however not being accustomed like her daughterinlaw to the sight of jewels took them only for common fruit and wished to give them to the child to eat. She was very angry when the princess hastily took them from her and hid them in her dress while she went to the market and bought the three finest pomegranates she could find which she handed the old woman for the little boy.Then she bought beautiful new clothes for all of them and when they were dressed they looked as fine as could be. Next she took out one of the precious stones which her husband had sent her and placed it in a small silver box. This she wrapped up in a handkerchief embroidered in gold and filled the old womans pockets with gold and silver pieces.Go dear mother she said to the palace and present the jewel to the king and if he asks you what he can give you in return tell him that you want a paper with his seal attached proclaiming that no one is to meddle with anything you may choose to do. Before you leave the palace distribute the money amongst the servants.The old woman took the box and started for the palace. No one there had ever seen a ruby of such beauty and the most famous jeweller in the town was summoned to declare its value. But all he could say wasIf a boy threw a stone into the air with all his might and you could pile up gold as high as the flight of the stone it would not be sufficient to pay for this ruby.At these words the kings face fell. Having once seen the ruby he could not bear to part with it yet all the money in his treasury would not be enough to buy it. So for a little while he remained silent wondering what offer he could make the old woman and at last he saidIf I cannot give you its worth in money is there anything you will take in exchange A paper signed by your hand and sealed with your seal proclaiming that I may do what I will without let or hindrance answered she promptly. And the king delighted to have obtained what he coveted at so small a cost gave her the paper without delay. Then the old woman took her leave and returned home.The fame of this wonderful ruby soon spread far and wide and envoys arrived at the little house to know if there were more stones to sell. Each king was so anxious to gain possession of the treasure that he bade his messenger outbid all the rest and so the princess sold the two remaining stones for a sum of money so large that if the gold pieces had been spread out they would have reached from here to the moon. The first thing she did was to build a palace by the side of the cottage and it was raised on pillars of gold in which were set great diamonds which blazed night and day. Of course the news of this palace was the first thing that reached the king her father on his return from the wars and he hurried to see it. In the doorway stood a young man of twenty who was his grandson though neither of them knew it and so pleased was the king with the appearance of the youth that he carried him back to his own palace and made him commander of the whole army.Not long after this the widows son returned to his native land. There sure enough was the tiny cottage where he had lived with his mother but the gorgeous building beside it was quite new to him. What had become of his wife and his mother and who could be dwelling in that other wonderful place  These were the first thoughts that flashed through his mind but not wishing to betray himself by asking questions of passing strangers he climbed up into a tree that stood opposite the palace and watched.By  and  by a lady came out and began to gather some of the roses and jessamine that hung about the porch. The twenty years that had passed since he had last beheld her vanished in an instant and he knew her to be his own wife looking almost as young and beautiful as on the day of their parting. He was about to jump down from the tree and hasten to her side when she was joined by a young man who placed his arm affectionately round her neck. At this sight the angry husband drew his bow but before he could let fly the arrow the counsel of the wise man came back to himPatience is the first step on the road to happiness. And he laid it down again.At this moment the princess turned and drawing her companions head down to hers kissed him on each cheek. A second time blind rage filled the heart of the watcher and he snatched up his bow from the branch where it hung when words heard long since seemed to sound in his earsHe wins who waits. And the bow dropped to his side. Then through the silent air came the sound of the youths voiceMother can you tell me nothing about my father  Does he still live and will he never return to us Alas  my son how can I answer you  replied the lady. Twenty years have passed since he left us to make his fortune and in that time only once have I heard aught of him. But what has brought him to your mind just now Because last night I dreamed that he was here said the youth and then I remembered what I have so long forgotten that I had a father though even his very history was strange to me. And now tell me I pray you all you can concerning him.And standing under the jessamine the son learnt his fathers history and the man in the tree listened also.Oh exclaimed the youth when it was ended while he twisted his hands in pain I am generalinchief you are the kings daughter and we have the most splendid palace in the whole world yet my father lives we know not where and for all we can guess may be poor and miserable. Tomorrow I will ask the king to give me soldiers and I will seek him over the whole earth till I find him.Then the man came down from the tree and clasped his wife and son in his arms. All that night they talked and when the sun rose it still found them talking. But as soon as it was proper he went up to the palace to pay his homage to the king and to inform him of all that had happened and who they all really were. The king was overjoyed to think that his daughter whom he had long since forgiven and sorely missed was living at his gates and was besides the mother of the youth who was so dear to him. It was written beforehand cried the monarch. You are my soninlaw before the world and shall be king after me.And the man bowed his head.He had waited and he had won.
There was here once in our village a certain Avstriyat who was such a wizard that he could cause rain or hail to pass away when he chose. It happened that we were cutting corn in the country a cloud came up. We began to hurry off the sheaves but he took no notice cut and cut away by himself smoked his pipe and said Dont be frightenedtherell be no rain. Lo and behold there was no rain. Onceall this I saw with my own eyeswe were cutting rye when the sky became black the wind rose it began to whistle at first afar off then over our very heads. There was thunder lightning whirlwindsuch a tempest thatO God Thy will be done We went after our sheaves but heDont be frightened therell be no rain. Where wont it be We didnt hearken to him. But he smoked his pipe out and cut away quietly by himself. Up came a man on a black horse and all black himself he darted straight up to Avstriyat Hey give permission said he. Avstriyat replied No I wont Give permission be merciful I wont. It would be impossible to get such a quantity in. The black horseman bowed to the man and hastened off over the country.Then the black cloud became gray and whitened. Our elders feared that there would be hail. But Avstriyat took no notice. He cut the corn by himself and smoked his pipe. But again a horseman came up he hastened over the country still quicker than the first. But this one was all in white and on a white horse. Give permission he shouted to Avstriyat. I wont Give permission for Gods sake I wont. It wouldnt be possible to get such a quantity in. Hey give permission I cant hold out Then and not till then did Avstriyat relent. Well then go now but only into the glen which is beyond the plain. Scarcely had he spoken when the horseman disappeared and hail poured down as out of a basket. In the course of a short hour it filled the glen brimful level with the banks.
There were once a man and a woman who had an only child and lived quite alone in a solitary valley. It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir and took with her little Hans who was just two years old. As it was springtime and the child took pleasure in the manycoloured flowers she went still further onwards with him into the forest. Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket seized the mother and child and carried them far away into the black forest where no one ever came from one years end to another. The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free but their hearts were made of stone they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties and drove her on farther by force. After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles they came to a rock where there was a door at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once. They had to go through a long dark passage and at last came into a great cavern which was lighted by a fire which burnt on the hearth. On the wall hung swords sabres and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling and the captain sat at the head of it. As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her and told her to be at ease and have no fear they would do nothing to hurt her but she must look after the housekeeping and if she kept everything in order she should not fare ill with them. Thereupon they gave her something to eat and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child.The woman stayed many years with the robbers and Hans grew tall and strong. His mother told him stories and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave. When Hans was nine years old he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir hid it behind the bed and then went to his mother and said Dear mother pray tell me who is my father I must and will know. His mother was silent and would not tell him that he might not become homesick moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father. In the night when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition Hans brought out his club stood before the captain and said I now wish to know who is my father and if thou dost not at once tell me I will strike thee down. Then the captain laughed and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table. Hans got up again held his tongue and thought I will wait another year and then try again perhaps I shall do better then. When the year was over he brought out his club again rubbed the dust off it looked at it well and said It is a stout strong club. At night the robbers came home drank one jug of wine after another and their heads began to be heavy. Then Hans brought out his club placed himself before the captain and asked him who was his father But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table but it was not long before he was up again and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs. His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength. When Hans had done his work he went to his mother and said Now I have shown myself to be in earnest but now I must also know who is my father. Dear Hans answered the mother come we will go and seek him until we find him. She took from the captain the key to the entrancedoor and Hans fetched a great mealsack and packed into it gold and silver and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful until it was full and then he took it on his back. They left the cave but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight and saw the green forest and the flowers and the birds and the morning sun in the sky. He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise. His mother looked for the way home and when they had walked for a couple of hours they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house. The father was sitting in the doorway. He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son for he had long regarded them both as dead. But Hans although he was not twelve years old was a head taller than his father. They went into the little room together but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar. God save us cried the father whats that Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces Dont grow any grey hairs about that dear father answered Hans there in that sack is more than is wanting for a new house. The father and Hans at once began to build a new house to buy cattle and land and to keep a farm. Hans ploughed the fields and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw. The next spring Hans said Keep all the money and get a walkingstick that weighs a hundredweight made for me that I may go atravelling. When the wishedfor stick was ready he left his fathers house went forth and came to a deep dark forest. There he heard something crunching and cracking looked round and saw a firtree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to the top and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who had laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willowwand. Hollo cried Hans what art thou doing up there The fellow replied I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them. That is what I like thought Hans he has some strength and he called to him Leave that alone and come with me. The fellow came down and he was taller by a whole head than Hans and Hans was not little. Thy name is now Firtwister said Hans to him. Thereupon they went further and heard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook at every stroke. Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist. When Hans asked what he was about he answered At night when I want to sleep bears wolves and other vermin of that kind come which sniff and snuffle about me and wont let me rest so I want to build myself a house and lay myself inside it so that I may have some peace. Oh indeed thought Hans I can make use of this one also and said to him Leave thy housebuilding alone and go with me thou shalt be called Rocksplitter. The man consented and they all three roamed through the forest and wherever they went the wild beasts were terrified and ran away from them. In the evening they came to an old deserted castle went up into it and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep. The next morning Hans went into the garden. It had run quite wild and was full of thorns and bushes. And as he was thus walking round about a wild boar rushed at him he however gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly. He took it on his shoulders and carried it in and they put it on a spit roasted it and enjoyed themselves. Then they arranged that each day in turn two should go out hunting and one should stay at home and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them. Firtwister stayed at home the first and Hans and Rocksplitter went out hunting. When Firtwister was busy cooking a little shrivelledup old mannikin came to him in the castle and asked for some meat. Be off sly hypocrite he answered thou needest no meat. But how astonished Firtwister was when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him and belaboured him so with his fists that he could not defend himself but fell on the ground and gasped for breath The dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him. When the two others came home from hunting Firtwister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he himself had received and thought When they stay at home they may just try their chance with the little scrubbingbrush and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.The next day Rocksplitter stayed at home and he fared just as Firtwister had done he was very illtreated by the dwarf because he was not willing to give him any meat. When the others came home in the evening Firtwister easily saw what he had suffered but both kept silence and thought Hans also must taste some of that soup.Hans who had to stay at home the next day did his work in the kitchen as it had to be done and as he was standing skimming the pan the dwarf came and without more ado demanded a bit of meat. Then Hans thought He is a poor wretch I will give him some of my share that the others may not run short and handed him a bit. When the dwarf had devoured it he again asked for some meat and goodnatured Hans gave it to him and told him it was a handsome piece and that he was to be content with it. But the dwarf begged again for the third time. Thou art shameless said Hans and gave him none. Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated Firtwister and Rocksplitter but he had got to the wrong man. Hans without exerting himself much gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps. Hans was about to run after him but fell right over him for he was so tall. When he rose up again the dwarf had got the start of him. Hans hurried after him as far as the forest and saw him slip into a hole in the rock. Hans now went home but he had marked the spot. When the two others came back they were surprised that Hans was so well. He told them what had happened and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them. Hans laughed and said It served you quite right why were you so greedy with your meat It is a disgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten by the dwarf. Thereupon they took a basket and a rope and all three went to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped and let Hans and his club down in the basket. When Hans had reached the bottom he found a door and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who was lovely as any picture nay so beautiful that no words can express it and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at Hans like a seacat She however was bound with chains and looked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her and thought to himself Thou must deliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead. Immediately the chains fell from the maiden and Hans was enraptured with her beauty. She told him she was a Kings daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her home and imprisoned there among the rocks because she would have nothing to say to him. The count had however set the dwarf as a watchman and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough. And now Hans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up the basket came down again but Hans did not trust his two companions and thought They have already shown themselves to be false and told me nothing about the dwarf who knows what design they may have against me So he put his club in the basket and it was lucky he did for when the basket was halfway up they let it fall again and if Hans had really been sitting in it he would have been killed. But now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel. It is indeed sad said he to himself that I have to waste away down here and as he was thus walking backwards and forwards he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden had been sitting and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled. Then he drew it off and put it on and when he turned it round on his finger he suddenly heard something rustle over his head. He looked up and saw spirits of the air hovering above who told him he was their master and asked what his desire might be Hans was at first struck dumb but afterwards he said that they were to carry him above again. They obeyed instantly and it was just as if he had flown up himself. When however he was above again he found no one in sight. Firtwister and Rocksplitter had hurried away and had taken the beautiful maiden with them. But Hans turned the ring and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea. Hans ran and ran without stopping until he came to the seashore and there far far out on the water he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were sitting and in fierce anger he leapt without thinking what he was doing club in hand into the water and began to swim but the club which weighed a hundredweight dragged him deep down until he was all but drowned. Then in the very nick of time he turned his ring and immediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into the boat. He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the reward they merited and threw them into the water and then he sailed with the beautiful maiden who had been in the greatest alarm and whom he delivered for the second time home to her father and mother and married her and all rejoiced exceedingly.
There was once a young shepherd an honest industrious fellow who passed most of his time in the hills looking after his masters flocks. One afternoon he happened upon a bush which some gipsies had set afire. As he stopped to watch it he heard a strange hissing whistling sound. He went as close as he could and in the center of the bush which the flames had not yet reached he saw a snake. It was writhing and trembling in fear.Help me brother the snake said. Help me and I will reward you richly I swear I willThe shepherd put the end of his crook over the flames and the snake crawled up the crook up the shepherds arm and wound itself about his neck.It was now the shepherds turn to be frightened.What Will you kill me as a reward for my kindnessNay the snake said. Do not be afraid. I will not injure you. Do as I tell you and you will have nothing to regret. My father is the Tsar of the Snakes. Take me to him and he will reward you for rescuing me.But I cant leave my flocks the shepherd said.Have no fear about your flocks. Nothing will happen to them in your absence.But I dont know where your father the Tsar of the Snakes lives the shepherd protested.Ill show you the snake said. Ill point out the direction with my tail.So in spite of his misgivings the shepherd at last agreed to the snakes suggestion and leaving his sheep in Gods care started up the mountainside in the direction which the snake pointed out with his tail.They reached finally a sort of pocket in the hills which was sandy and rocky and exposed to the full force of the sun. The snake directed the shepherd to the entrance of a cave which had a huge door composed entirely of living snakes closely wound together. The shepherds snake said something in his breathy whistling voice and the door pulled itself apart and allowed the shepherd to enter the cave.Now whispered the snake when my father asks you what you want tell him you want the gift of understanding the language of the animals. He will try to give you something else but dont you accept anything else.The Tsar of the Snakes was a huge creature clothed in a gorgeous skin of red and yellow and black. They found him reclining on a golden table with a crown of precious jewels on his head.My son he cried when he saw the snake that was still wound about the shepherds neck where have you been We have been grieving for you thinking you had met some misfortune.But for this shepherd my father the snake said I should have been burned to death. He rescued me.Then he told the Tsar of the Snakes the whole story. The Tsar of the Snakes listened carefully and when the Snake Prince was finished he turned to the shepherd and saidSir I am deeply indebted to you for saving my sons life. Ask of me anything I can grant and it is yours.Give me then the shepherd said the gift of understanding the language of the animals.Not that the Tsar of the Snakes cried. It is too dangerous a gift If ever you confessed to some other human being that you had this gift and repeated what some animal said you would die that instant. Ask something elseanything elseNo the shepherd insisted. Give me that or nothingWhen the Tsar of the Snakes saw that the shepherd was not to be dissuaded he saidVery well then. What must be must be. Come now very close to me and put your mouth against my mouth. Do you breathe three times into my mouth and I shall breathe three times into your mouth. Then you will understand the language of the animals.So the shepherd put his mouth close to the mouth of the Tsar of the Snakes and breathed into it three times. Then the Tsar of the Snakes breathed into the shepherds mouth three times.Now you will understand the language of all animals the Tsar of the Snakes said. It is a dangerous gift but if you remember my warning it may bring you great prosperity. Farewell.So the shepherd went back to his flocks and lay down under a fir tree to rest. Presently he wondered whether he hadnt been asleep and dreamed about the burning bush and the snake and the Tsar of the Snakes.It cant be real he said to himself. How can I or any man understand the language of the animalsJust then two ravens alighted on the tree above his head.Caw Caw said one of them. Wouldnt that shepherd be surprised if he knew he was lying on some buried treasureCaw Caw laughed the other. Hell never know for hes only one of those poor stupid human beings who cant understand a word we sayThe ravens flew off and the shepherd sat up and rubbed his eyes to make sure he was awake.Am I dreaming again he asked himself or did I really understand them Well Ill soon find out. Tomorrow Ill bring a spade and then if theres any treasure buried under this tree I wont be long in digging it up.He marked the spot where he had been lying when the ravens spoke and the next day came back and dug. Three feet below the surface his spade hit something that proved to be a big iron pot chockfull of golden ducats.He carried the treasure to his master and his master was so pleased at his honesty that he gave him half of it.So now the shepherd was able to set up in life for himself. He bought a farm and married and settled down as the saying is. The years went by and he grew prosperous and rich.One Christmas Eve he said to his wifeIm thinking wife of my youth when I was a shepherd and how lonely it was at times like this when other folk were at home seated about the fire and making merry. Let us give our shepherds out on the hills a surprise tonight. We can take them meats and wine and other food and then Ill go out and guard the sheep while you serve them a fine Christmas supper.His wife agreed and they mounted their horses and rode out to the hills taking with them great hampers of food and wine. The wife entertained the shepherds in their hut with a big jolly supper and the master stayed outside all night with the dogs guarding the sheep.At midnight some wolves came prowling around the flocks.See here they said to the dogs if you let us in well kill the sheep and then well divide the carcasses with you.The dogs for the most part were young and thoughtless and ready enough to fall in with the wolves suggestion. But there was one old sheepdog that nothing could tempt.Ive only a few teeth left he growled but those few are still sound and let any wolf come a step nearer and Ill tear him to piecesAll night long that one old sheepdog stood on guard faithful to duty.In the morning the master ordered the shepherds to kill the young dogs and train in new ones.The shepherds were surprised.The masters a clever one they told each other. Just one night and he found out how worthless those young dogs wereAs the farmer and his wife were riding home the farmers horse ran on ahead.Not so fast begged the mare that the wife was riding. Have pity on me and go more slowly. You have only the master to carry while Im all laden down with hampers and empty jugs and I dont know what and with a mistress thats twice as big as she was a few months agoThe farmer when he heard the mares complaint burst out laughing.What are you laughing at his wife asked sharply.Nothing the farmer said.Youre laughing at me the wife declared I know you are just because Im so big that Im awkward in the saddleNo my dear Im not laughing at you truly Im not.You are I know you are and I dont think its kind of you either And the wife burst into tears.Now my dear the husband said soothingly be sensible and believe me when I tell you I was not laughing at you.Then what were you laughing atI cant tell you because if I did tell you then I should die the next moment.Die the next moment the wife said. Stuff and nonsense It must be a strange thing indeed if a man cant tell his own wife for fear hell die the next momentThe more she thought about it the more enraged she became and also the more curious.If you really loved me youd tell me she wept.All the way home she kept on worrying her husband and nagging at him until at last in utter exhaustion he saidPeace woman peace and Ill tell you But first let me have my coffin made for as Ive warned you I shall die the moment Ive spoken.So he had the village carpenter build him a coffin and when it was ready he stood it up on end against the house and got inside of it.The news of what was about to happen spread among the animals and the faithful old sheepdog hurried down from the hills to be with his master at the end. He lay down at the foot of the coffin and howled.Ive one faithful friend the farmer said. Wife give the poor dog some bread before I tell you my secret and die.The woman threw the old dog a hunk of bread but the dog refused it and kept on howling.The rooster from the barnyard came running up and began gobbling down the bread with great gusto.You shameless animal the dog said sternly. Heres the poor master about to die on account of that foolish inquisitive wife of his and yet you have so little feeling that youre delighted at the chance to gorge yourself with foodThe rooster clucked scornfully.See here old dog I cant waste any sympathy on that master of ours Any man who allows his wife to bully him deserves whatever he gets Look at me The rooster puffed out his chest and gave a loud Cockadoodledo Ive got fifty wives but do they bully me They do not Whenever I find a nice fat worm or a grain of corn I set up an awful noise and gather them all around me. Then I eat it while they stand there and admire me No no old dog I have no patience with the master He has only one wife and he doesnt know how to rule herThe roosters right thought the farmer.With that he jumped out of the coffin picked up a stick and gave his wife a sound beating.So youd kill your husband just to satisfy your curiosity would you he shouted angrily. Very well then Take this and this and this And if your curiosity is still unsatisfied Ill give you some moreStop Stop Stop cried the wife. Do you want to injure meBut the farmer did not stop until he had given her such a whipping that she never forgot it. When it was over she begged his pardon humbly and promised never again to ask him anything that he didnt want to tell her.You just mustnt let me be so foolish again she said.I wont the farmer declared.Then he puffed out his chest and strutted about until youd have laughed to see himhe looked so much like the rooster
The Flea the Grasshopper and the Frog once wanted to see which of them could jump the highest. They made a festival and invited the whole world and every one else besides who liked to come and see the grand sight. Three famous jumpers they were as all should say when they met together in the room.I will give my daughter to him who shall jump highest said the King it would be too bad for you to have the jumping and for us to offer no prize.The Flea was the first to come forward. He had most exquisite manners and bowed to the company on every side for he was of noble blood and besides was accustomed to the society of man and that of course had been an advantage to him.Listen to The Leaping Match plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devicesNext came the Grasshopper. He was not quite so elegantly formed as the Flea but he knew perfectly well how to conduct himself and he wore the green uniform which belonged to him by right of birth. He said moreover that he came of a very ancient Egyptian family and that in the house where he then lived he was much thought of.The fact was that he had been just brought out of the fields and put in a cardhouse three stories high and built on purpose for him with the colored sides inwards and doors and windows cut out of the Queen of Hearts. And I sing so well said he that sixteen parlorbred crickets who have chirped from infancy and yet got no one to build them cardhouses to live in have fretted themselves thinner even than before from sheer vexation on hearing me.It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper made the most of themselves each thinking himself quite an equal match for the princess.The Leapfrog said not a word but people said that perhaps he thought the more and the housedog who snuffed at him with his nose allowed that he was of good family. The old councilor who had had three orders given him in vain for keeping quiet asserted that the Leapfrog was a prophet for that one could see on his back whether the coming winter was to be severe or mild which is more than one can see on the back of the man who writes the almanac.I say nothing for the present exclaimed the King yet I have my own opinion for I observe everything.And now the match began. The Flea jumped so high that no one could see what had become of him and so they insisted that he had not jumped at allwhich was disgraceful after all the fuss he had made.The Grasshopper jumped only half as high but he leaped into the Kings face who was disgusted by his rudeness.The Leapfrog stood for a long time as if lost in thought people began to think he would not jump at all.Im afraid he is ill said the dog and he went to snuff at him again when lo he suddenly made a sideways jump into the lap of the princess who sat close by on a little golden stool.There is nothing higher than my daughter said the King therefore to bound into her lap is the highest jump that can be made. Only one of good understanding would ever have thought of that. Thus the Frog has shown that he has sense. He has brains in his head that he has.And so he won the princess.I jumped the highest for all that said the Flea but its all the same to me. The princess may have the stifflegged slimy creature if she likes. In this world merit seldom meets its reward. Dullness and heaviness win the day. I am too light and airy for a stupid world.And so the Flea went into foreign service.The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank and reflected on the world and its ways and he too said Yes dullness and heaviness win the day a fine exterior is what people care for nowadays. And then he began to sing in his own peculiar wayand it is from his song that we have taken this little piece of history which may very possibly be all untrue although it does stand printed here in black and white.
DAGWANOEnYENT Whirlwind an old woman the oldest of all her people lived in the forest with her two grandchildren a boy and a girl.One day when the grandmother was out digging roots a GNOnSKWA Frost and Great Cold woman came to the cabin picked up the little girl and after speaking kindly telling her she was a nice little thing swallowed her.Then she began to talk to the boy. Sitting down by him she said Get on to my back and I will carry you to where your grandmother is digging roots.The boy did as GNOnSKWA told him to but he was frightened and he clung to her so tightly that he became fastened to her back and couldnt get off though he tried hard.GNOnSKWA started off but in a different direction from where the boys grandmother was. When the boy told her she was going the wrong way she said No I am not we will soon come to where she is at work.The woman went far into the forest and the boy began to cry for his grandmother. He cried so hard and loud that GNOnSKWA told him to get off of her back. She didnt like to hear him cry and she thought it was best to eat him at once.He couldnt get off and she couldnt put her hands around to pull him off nor turn her head to bite him.When the boy saw that she couldnt harm him if he stayed where he was he clung all the tighter and stopped trying to get away.When the grandmother came home and found that the boy and girl were not in the cabin she was frightened and began to search for them. After a while she came upon the tracks of the GNOnSKWA woman and then she knew who had stolen the children and she followed the tracks thinking she would soon overtake the thief.The woman was tired of the boy and tried in every way to free herself of him. She rubbed him against hickory trees and against rocks. He said Oh I like that rub harder. She stopped then and traveled on.The grandmother followed in the form of a Whirlwind GNOnSKWA said to the boy Your grandmother is coming. She will kill us both. Get off of my back.The boy kept still didnt answer. The woman looked around for a hiding place and found one in a deep ravine. She dug a hole went into it and covered herself with the earth that slipped down from above. When she heard Whirlwind coming nearer and nearer she asked the boy Can you hear your grandmother comingHe didnt answer.When Whirlwind rushed over the place where the woman lay the boy shouted to her. She heard him and changing her course came straight to where they were. When she asked the boy if he was there the woman told him to keep still but he called out I am hereWhirlwind blew the earth from the hiding place and shouted DAGWANOEnYENT get off of GNOnSKWAs back That instant the boy slipped off and went among the rocks. The old woman hurled stones at the GNOnSKWA tore off her clothes and killed her. Then she took her grandson and started for home.On the way she said to him Never let yourself be treated in that manner again. Never let anyone abuse you. You can conquer everybody if you use your power for you are of the Whirlwind family.The old woman stayed at home for a time caring for her grandson.Meanwhile some of the GNOnSKWA womans people found her trail and followed it till they came to where her body was. They asked who had killed her and her spirit answered Whirlwind killed me. Right away the GNOnSKWA men decided to kill old woman Whirlwind.Whirlwind out on one of her journeys discovered their plans. She went home and said to her grandson We must get your sister out of GNOnSKWA s stomach she is sitting there and crying for me.They set out and when they reached the place where the body lay the old grandmother built a fire and began to burn tobacco saying This is what we like This is what we like She burned half a pouchful and pushed the smoke toward the body repeating This is what we like. Then she called My grandchild come out of GNOnSKWAs bodyWhen the girl didnt come the old woman said to her grandson We must have people come and help us. We have many relatives uncles aunts and cousins we will call them. Then she called each relative by name and one after another they came. They built a fire at GNOnSKWAs head and burned tobacco as they walked around the fire each threw in tobacco saying Ne vonoes ne vonoes This is what we like.When the last one had thrown in tobacco the girl panting for breath came out and asked How long have I been here She was very weak. They gave her tobacco smoke and she inhaled it till she gained strength then all Whirlwinds went home.When the old woman and her grandchildren had been at home some time a GNOnSKWA woman came to the cabin she talked pleasantly found out there were only three persons there and left thinking it would be a small task to kill them.After the woman had gone Whirlwind said to her grandchildren We are in trouble now. A great number of those people will come against us. They have assembled somewhere nearby. When the struggle begins I dont know that we will be able to come home again. She went out and called DAGWANOEnYENT GOWA DAGWANOEnYENT GOWAThe girl asked Grandmother what are you doingI am calling our relatives answered the old woman.The Whirlwinds came one by one when all were there the old woman said Each one of you must have a big round stone to strike with.They had just picked up the stones when the GNOnSKWAs began to come there were thousands and thousands of them.The Whirlwinds were frightened when they saw how. strong the enemy was. The old woman said We must separate and fight singly. Keep the stones in your hands Be firm and have faith that you will kill one man with each blow you strike.The Whirlwinds went in different directions the GNOnSKWAs chased them.The Whirlwinds struck whenever they had the chance and kept retreating they went up a high mountain fighting as they went. The old woman said When we all reach the top we will go down a short distance on the other side. When the GNOnSKWAs come to the top we will strike them on the east and on the west some of us will get behind them and drive them over the mountain and into the deep ravine on the other side they will die there for a river runs through the ravine and they cannot cross it.The GNOnSKWAs came to the top of the mountain and seeing nothing of the Whirlwinds thought they had escaped. They stood and listened. Soon they heard wind on each side of them. The sound grew louder and louder and right away the DAGWANOEnYENTs struck them on both sides and uniting in the rear struck them from behind. So fierce was the attack and power of the Whirlwinds that they tore out all the trees by their roots swept the earth from the top of the mountain and hurled trees and earth into the ravine and river below. The GNOnSKWAs Were piled up like rocks in the river and along the banks.The Whirlwinds were dancing and rejoicing on the top of the mountain when the old woman said We have hurled our enemies into the ravine now we will finish them. Half of you go along the ridges east of the river and the other half go along the western ridges and blow all the trees and rocks and earth into the ravine.They went and when they came together again they had stripped the mountain spurs naked and filled up the ravine. The river had no outlet it became a great lake and ever after was called The grave of the GNOnSKWAs.
Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who ruled over a country so small that you could easily walk round it in one day. They were both very good simple people not very wise perhaps but anxious to be kind to everybody and this was often a mistake for the king allowed all his subjects to talk at once and offer advice upon the government of the kingdom as well as upon private matters. And the end of it all was that it was very difficult to get any laws made and still more to get anyone to obey them.Now no traveller ever passed through the kingdom without inquiring how it came to be so small. And this was the reason. As soon as Petaldo for that was the kings name had been born his father and mother betrothed him to the niece of their friend the fairy Gangana  if she should ever have one. But as the years passed on and Gangana was still without a niece the young prince forgot all about his destined bride and when he was twentyfive he secretly married the beautiful daughter of a rich farmer with whom he had fallen violently in love.When the fairy heard the news she fell into a violent rage and hurried off to tell the king. The old man thought in his heart that his son had waited quite long enough but he did not dare to say so lest some dreadful spell might be thrown over them all and they should be changed into birds or snakes or worst of all into stones. So much against his will he was obliged to disinherit the young man and to forbid him to come to court. Indeed he would have been a beggar had it not been for the property his wife had had given her by the farmer which the youth obtained permission to erect into a kingdom.Most princes would have been very angry at this treatment especially as the old king soon died and the queen was delighted to reign in his place. But Petaldo was a contented young man and was quite satisfied with arranging his tiny court on the model of his fathers and having a lord chamberlain and a high steward and several gentlemen in attendance while the young queen appointed her own ladiesinwaiting and maids of honour. He likewise set up a mint to coin money and chose a seneschal as head of the five policemen who kept order in the capital and punished the boys who were caught in the act of throwing stones at the palace windows.The first to fill this important office was the young kings fatherinlaw an excellent man of the name of Caboche. He was much beloved by everyone and so sensible that he was not at all vain at rising at once to the dignity of seneschal when he had only been a common farmer but went about his fields every day as usual. This conduct so struck his king that very soon he never did anything without consulting him.Each morning Caboche and his soninlaw had breakfast together and when they had finished the king took out of his iron chest great bundles of state papers which he desired to talk over with his seneschal. Sometimes they would spend two hours at least in deciding these important matters but more often after a few minutes Caboche would sayExcuse me sire but your majesty does not understand this affair in the least. Leave it to me and I will settle it.But what am I to do then  asked the king. And his minister answeredOh you can rule your wife and see after your fruit garden. You will find that those two things will take up all your time.Well perhaps you are right the king replied secretly glad to be rid of the cares of government. But though Caboche did all the work Petaldo never failed to appear on grand occasions in his royal mantle of red linen holding a sceptre of gilded wood. Meanwhile he passed his mornings in studying books from which he learned the proper seasons to plant his fruit trees and when they should be pruned and his afternoons in his garden where he put his knowledge into practice. In the evening he played cards with his fatherinlaw and supped in public with the queen and by ten oclock everybody in the palace was fast asleep.The queen on her side was quite as happy as her husband. She loved to be in her dairy and nobody in the kingdom could make such delicious cheeses. But however busy she might be she never forgot to bake a little barley cake and make a tiny cream cheese and to put them under a particular rosetree in the garden. If you had asked her whom they were for and where they went to she could not have told you but would have said that on the night of her marriage a fairy had appeared to her in a dream and had bidden her to perform this ceremony.After the king and the queen had six children a little boy was born with a small red cap on his head so that he was quite different from his brothers and sisters and his parents loved Cadichon better than any of them.The years went on and the children were growing big when one day after Gillette the queen had finished baking her cake and had turned it out on a plate a lovely blue mouse crept up the leg of the table and ran to the plate. Instead of chasing it away as most women would have done the queen pretended not to notice what the mouse was doing and was much surprised to see the little creature pick up the cake and carry it off to the chimney. She sprang forwards to stop it when suddenly both the mouse and cake vanished and in their place stood an old woman only a foot high whose clothes hung in rags about her. Taking up a sharp pointed iron stick she drew on the earthen floor some strange signs uttering seven cries as she did so and murmuring something in a low voice among which the queen was sure she caught the words faith wisdom happiness. Then seizing the kitchen broom she whirled it three times round her head and vanished. Immediately there arose a great noise in the next room and on opening the door the queen beheld three large cockchafers each one with a princess between its feet while the princes were seated on the backs of three swallows. In the middle was a car formed of a single pink shell and drawn by two robin redbreasts and in this car Cadichon was sitting by the side of the blue mouse who was dressed in a splendid mantle of black velvet fastened under her chin. Before the queen had recovered from her surprise cockchafers redbreasts mouse and children had all flown singing to the window and disappeared from view.The loud shrieks of the queen brought her husband and father running into the room and when at last they made out from her broken sentences what had really happened they hastily snatched up some stout sticks that were lying about and set off to the rescue  one going in one direction and the other in another.For at least an hour the queen sat sobbing where they had left her when at last she was roused by a piece of folded paper falling at her feet. She stooped and picked it up eagerly hoping that it might contain some news of her lost children. It was very short but when she had read the few words Gillette was comforted for it bade her take heart as they were well and happy under the protection of a fairy. On your own faith and prudence depend your happiness ended the writer. It is I who have all these years eaten the food you placed under the rosetree and some day I shall reward you for it. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait is the advice given by  The Fairy of the Fields.Then the queen rose up and bathed her face and combed her shining hair and as she turned away. from her mirror she beheld a linnet sitting on her bed. No one would have known that it was anything but a common linnet and yesterday the queen would have thought so too. But this morning so many wonderful things had happened that she did not doubt for a moment that the writer of the letter was before her.Pretty linnet said she I will try to do all you wish. Only give me I pray you now and then news of my little Cadichon.And the linnet flapped her wings and sang and flew away. So the queen knew that she had guessed rightly and thanked her in her heart.Byandby the king and his seneschal returned hungry and tired with their fruitless search. They were amazed and rather angry to find the queen whom they had left weeping quite cheerful. Could she really care for her children so little and have forgotten them so soon  What could have caused this sudden change  But to all their questions Gillette would only answerEverything comes to him who knows how to wait.That is true replied her father and after all your majesty must remember that the revenues of your kingdom would hardly bear the cost of seven princes and princesses brought up according to their rank. Be grateful then to those who have relieved you of the burden.You are right  You are always right  cried the king whose face once more beamed with smiles. And life at the palace went on as before till Petaldo received a piece of news which disturbed him greatly.The queen his mother who had for some time been a widow suddenly made up her mind to marry again and her choice had fallen on the young king of the Green Isles who was younger than her own son and besides handsome and fond of pleasure which Petaldo was not. Now the grandmother foolish though she was in many respects had the sense to see that a woman as old and as plain as she was could hardly expect a young man to fall in love with her and that if this was to happen it would be needful to find some spell which would bring back her youth and beauty. Of course the fairy Gangana could have wrought the change with one wave of her wand but unluckily the two were no longer friends because the fairy had tried hard to persuade the queen to declare her niece heiress to the crown which the queen refused to do. Naturally therefore it was no use asking the help of Gangana to enable the queen to take a second husband who would be certain to succeed her and messengers were sent all over the neighbouring kingdoms seeking to find a witch or a fairy who would work the wishedfor miracle. None however could be found with sufficient skill and at length the queen saw that if ever the king of the Green Isles was to be her husband she must throw herself on the mercy of the fairy Gangana.The fairys wrath was great when she heard the queens story but she knew very well that as the king of the Green Isles had spent all his money he would probably be ready to marry even an old woman like her friend in order to get more. So in order to gain time she hid her feelings and told the queen that in three days the spell would be accomplished.Her words made the queen so happy that twenty years seemed to fall from her at once and she counted not only the hours but the minutes to the appointed time. It came at last and the fairy stood before her in a long robe of pink and silver held up by a tiny brown dwarf who carried a small box under his arm. The queen received her with all the marks of respect that she could think of and at the request of Gangana ordered the doors and windows of the great hall to be closed and her attendants to retire so that she and her guest might be quite alone. Then opening the box which was presented to her on one knee by the dwarf the fairy took from it a small vellum book with silver clasps a wand that lengthened out as you touched it and a crystal bottle filled with very clear green water. She next bade the queen sit on a seat in the middle of the room and the dwarf to stand opposite her after which she stooped down and drew three circles round them with a golden rod touched each of them thrice with her wand and sprinkled the liquid over both. Gradually the queens big features began to grow smaller and her face fresher while at the same time the dwarf became about twice as tall as he had been before. This sight added to the blue flames which sprang up from the three circles so frightened the queen that she fainted in her chair and when she recovered both the page and the fairy had vanished.At first she felt vaguely puzzled not remembering clearly what had happened then it all came back to her and jumping up she ran to the nearest mirror. Oh  how happy she was  Her long nose and her projecting teeth had become things of beauty her hair was thick and curly and bright gold. The fairy had indeed fulfilled her promise  But in her hurry and pleasure the queen never noticed that she had not been changed into a beautiful young lady but into a very tall little girl of eight or nine years old  Instead of her magnificent velvet dress edged with fur and embroidered in gold she wore a straight muslin frock with a little lace apron while her hair which was always combed and twisted and fastened with diamond pins hung in curls down her back. But if she had only known something besides this had befallen her for except as regards her love for the king of the Green Isles her mind as well as her face had become that of a child and this her courtiers were aware of if she was not. Of course they could not imagine what had occurred and did not know how to behave themselves till the chief minister set them the example by ordering his wife and daughters to copy the queens clothes and way of speaking. Then in a short time the whole court including the men talked and dressed like children and played with dolls or little tin soldiers while at the state dinners nothing was seen but iced fruits or sweet cakes made in the shape of birds and horses. But whatever she might be doing the queen hardly ceased talking about the king of the Green Isles whom she always spoke of as my little husband and as weeks passed on and he did not come she began to get very cross and impatient so that her courtiers kept away from her as much as they could. By this time too they were growing tired of pretending to be children and whispered their intention of leaving the palace and taking service under a neighbouring sovereign when one day a loud blast of trumpets announced the arrival of the longexpected guest. In an instant all was smiles again and in spite of the strictest rules of court etiquette the queen insisted on receiving the young king at the bottom of the stairs. Unfortunately in her haste she fell over her dress and rolled down several steps screaming like a child from fright. She was not really much hurt though she had scratched her nose and bruised her forehead but she was obliged to be carried to her room and have her face bathed in cold water. Still in spite of this she gave strict orders that the king should be brought to her presence the moment he entered the palace.A shrill blast outside her door sent a twinge of pain through the queens head which by this time was aching badly but in her joy at welcoming her future husband she paid no heed to it. Between two lines of courtiers bowing low the young king advanced quickly but at the sight of the queen and her bandages broke out into such violent fits of laughter that he was forced to leave the room and even the palace.When the queen had recovered from the vexation caused by the kings rude behaviour she bade her attendants to hasten after him and fetch him back but no promises or entreaties would persuade him to return. This of course made the queens temper even worse than it was before and a plot was set on foot to deprive her of the crown which would certainly have succeeded had not the fairy Gangana who had only wished to prevent her marriage restored her to her proper shape. But far from thanking her friend for this service the sight of her old face in the mirror filled her with despair and from that day she hated Gangana with a deadly hatred.And where were Petaldos children all this while  Why in the island of Bambini where they had playfellows to their hearts content and plenty of fairies to take care of them all. But out of all the seven princes and princesses whom the queen had seen carried off through the window there was only Cadichon who was good and obedient the other six were so rude and quarrelsome that they could get no one to play with them and at last as a punishment the fairy changed them all into marionettes till they should learn to behave better.Now in an unlucky moment the Fairy of the Fields determined to visit her friend the queen of the fairies who lived in a distant island in order to consult her as to what was to become of Cadichon.As she was entering the Hall of Audience Gangana was leaving it and sharp words were exchanged between them. After her enemy had flown off in a rage the Fairy of the Fields poured out the whole story of Ganganas wickedness to the queen and implored her counsel.Be comforted answered the fairy queen. For a while she must work her will and at this moment she is carrying off Cadichon to the island where she still holds her niece captive. But should she make an evil use of the power she has her punishment will be swift and great. And now I will give you this precious phial. Guard it carefully for the liquid it contains will cause you to become invisible and safe from the piercing eyes of all fairies. Against the eyes of mortals it has no charm With a heart somewhat lighter the Fairy of the Fields returned to her own island and the better to protect the six new marionettes from the wicked fairy she sprinkled them with a few drops of the liquid only avoiding just the tips of their noses so that she might be able to know them again. Then she set off for the kingdom of Petaldo which she found in a state of revolt because for the first time since he had ascended the throne he had dared to impose a tax. Indeed matters might have ended in a war or in cutting off the kings head had not the fairy discovered a means of contenting everybody and of whispering anew to the queen that all was well with her children for she dared not tell her of the loss of Cadichon.And what had become of Cadichon  Well the Fairy of the Fields had found out  by means of her books which had told her  that the poor little boy had been placed by Gangana in an enchanted island round which flowed a rapid river sweeping rocks and trees in its current. Besides the river the island was guarded by twentyfour enormous dragons breathing flames and forming a rampart of fire which it seemed as if none could pass.The Fairy of the Fields knew all this but she had a brave heart and determined that by some means or other she would overcome all obstacles and rescue Cadichon from the power of Gangana. So taking with her the water of invisibility she sprinkled it over her and mounting her favourite winged lizard set out for the island. When it appeared in sight she wrapped herself in her fireproof mantle then bidding the lizard return home she slipped past the dragons and entered the island.Scarcely had she done so than she beheld Gangana approaching her talking loudly and angrily to a genius who flew by her side. From what she said the fairy learned that Petaldos mother the old queen had died of rage on hearing of the marriage of the king of the Green Isles to a young and lovely bride and instead of leaving her kingdom to Gangana had bequeathed it to one of the children of her son Petaldo.But all the trouble I have had with that foolish old woman shall not go for nothing cried Gangana. Go at once to my stables and fetch out the strongest and swiftest griffins you can find in the stalls and harness them to the yellow coach. Drive this with all the speed you may to the Isle of Bambini and carry off the six children of Petaldo that are still there. I will see to Petaldo and Gillette myself. When I have got them all safe here I will change the parents into rabbits and the children into dogs. As for Cadichon I have not quite made up my mind what I shall do with him.The Fairy of the Fields did not wait to hear more. No time was to be lost in seeking the help of the fairy queen if Petaldo and his family were to be saved from this dreadful doom. So without waiting to summon her lizard she flew across the island and past the dragons till her feet once more touched the ground again. But at that instant a black cloud rolled over her loud thunder rent the air and the earth rocked beneath her. Then wild lightnings lit up the sky and by their flashes she saw the fourandtwenty dragons fighting together uttering shrieks and yells till the whole earth must have heard the uproar. Trembling with terror the fairy stood rooted to the spot and when day broke island torrent and dragons had vanished and in their stead was a barren rock. On the summit of the rock stood a black ostrich and on its back were seated Cadichon and the little niece of the fairy Gangana for whose sake she had committed so many evil deeds. While the Fairy of the Fields was gazing in surprise at this strange sight the ostrich spread its wings and flew off in the direction of the Fortunate Isle and followed unseen by the good fairy entered the great hall where the queen was sitting on her throne.Proud and exultant was Gangana in her new shape for by all the laws of fairydom if she succeeded in laying Cadichon at the feet of the queen and received him back from her he was in her power for life and she might do with him as she would. This the good fairy knew well and pressed on with all her strength for the dreadful events of the night had almost exhausted her. But with a mighty effort she snatched the children away from the back of the ostrich and placed them on the lap of the queen.With a scream of baffled rage the ostrich turned away and Gangana stood in her place waiting for the doom which she had brought upon herself.You have neglected all my warnings said the queen speaking more sternly than any fairy had ever heard her and my sentence is that during two hundred years you lose all your privileges as a fairy and under the form of an ostrich shall become the slave of the lowest and wickedest of the genii whom you have made your friends. As for these children I shall keep them with me and they shall be brought up at my court.And so they were until they grew up and were old enough to be married. Then the Fairy of the Fields took them back to the kingdom of the old queen where Petaldo was now reigning. But the cares of state proved too heavy both for him and Gillette after the quiet life they had led for so many years and they were rejoiced to be able to lay aside their crowns and place them on the heads of Cadichon and his bride who was as good as she was beautiful though she was the niece of the wicked. Gangana  And so well had Cadichon learned the lessons taught him at the court of the fairy queen that never since the kingdom was a kingdom had the people been so well governed or so happy. And they went about the streets and the fields smiling with joy at the difference between the old times and the new and whispering softly to each otherEverything comes to him who knows how to wait.
Long ago in a certain city in Spain there lived a youth who had no fondness whatever for work but a very great fondness for getting into debt. The foolish lad had used up his entire inheritance. There was nothing left with which to pay the pile of debts which he swiftly accumulated.One day a stranger appeared at his door who offered to settle all his debts on condition that the young man should do a days work for him. The youth gratefully accepted the offer for he thought that he could at least manage one days work no matter how hard it was.Be ready at five oclock tomorrow morning said the stranger as he paid the debts.The next morning the youth found the stranger at his door promptly at five oclock in the morning. He was mounted on a fine black horse and he had with him an extra bay horse upon which the boy was to ride. They rode on rapidly up hill and down through fertile valley lands and over narrow woodland trails until at last they reached the sea.Then the stranger who was riding ahead turned to the boy and said  Far out in the sea there is acastle lined with gold and silver. You are to accompany me there to aid me in filling some sacks to carry home. Come onThe youth looked fearfully at the angry waves. Very well Senor he replied you ride ahead please.Soon a great castle upon high rocks rose before them. Illustration by Maud and Miska Petersham. Published Tales of Enchantment from Spain 1920. Harcourt Brace and Company.The stranger spurred the fine black horse into the raging sea and there was nothing for the frightened youth to do except to follow upon the bay horse. The horses swam rapidly through the waves and soon a great castle upon high rocks rose before them.When they had climbed out of the water upon the rocks the stranger said It is your task to enter the castle and fill these two sacks one with gold and the other with silver. As soon as you fill them throw them down to me.The youth looked up at the high castle which frowned down at them from the summit of the steep rocks. I dont see any way to get into the castle he said.Then the stranger took a little book out of one of his pockets and opened it. The youth felt himself suddenly rising from the ground. He screamed with fright as he slowly rose to the top of the rock and then to a little window high up in the castle wall. He crawled into the window and filled the two bagsone with gold and the other with silver. He was amazed at the enormous piles of silver and gold which the castle contained.He threw the bags out of the window and prepared to descend but to his surprise the stranger loaded the two bags upon the bay horse seated himself upon the black horse and rode rapidly out to sea upon its back leading the bay horse after him. The youth shouted in vain. The man never turned his head to give him even a glance.The poor boy was in despair.  What shall I ever do he cried.  Here I am stranded upon this rock in the midst of the sea There is nothing to eat or drink in this castle nothing but silver and gold What shall I do O foolish boy that I was ever to allow myself to get into a situation like thisHe wandered through the castle but saw nothing anywhere except the great piles of silver and of gold.O mother of my soul he cried. It is my fate to die here in this deserted spot surrounded on all sides by the angry waves I cannot eat gold and drink silver.His hunger grew as time passed and his thirst was even harder to endure than the hunger. At last he noticed a damp spot on one of the castle walls. Perhaps I may be so fortunate as to find a spring of water said he as he eagerly began digging with his hands.He dug and dug for a long time until he was weak and faint. He found no water. All he discovered was a rat in the wall. He rested and then went on digging and at last he came to a heavy door.He opened the door anxiously for he did not know what might lie behind it. What he saw was a narrow stone stairway leading down into the depths of the earth.The boy committed his soul both to the angels and to the devils and descended the stairway. At the footof the stairs he found another door. It opened into a great hall. To his joy there was a fountain of water in the middle of the room. At the side of the fountain there was a table laden with rich foods.The first thing he did was to drink some of the water of the fountain. Then he began to taste the food.I may die but I will at least die with a full stomach he remarked.  What will happen next the good God alone knows.At the end of the meal the youth wandered about the great hall. Then he opened the door into the kitchen. There in the kitchen stood an old negress. She was very old and very fat and very black. She dropped the plate in her hands when she saw the boy she was so amazed at his presence.Poor lad What cruel person wished such evil upon you as to lead you to this place she cried.The boy told her the whole story. She nodded thoughtfully.Your punishment is greater than you deserve said she.  But if you are a quiet and obedient lad you may live on here in the castle. You will see no one except me.The youth spent many days in the castle. There was at least plenty to eat and drink but it was very lonely. Sometimes he would climb up the stairway to the upper tower of the castle and look out of the little window high up in the tower. He would gaze and gaze at the raging sea as it dashed angrily upon the rocks and long for his old life back in the land which lay far beyond the waves.He often questioned the old woman in the kitchen and at last he found out that there was a secret door in the castle wall which led to the dungeon where a beautiful princess was confined.You can never locate the door said the old negress. And even if you found it you could never reach the princess. You would have to pass two fierce lions and constantly revolving millstones and a deadly serpent. The lions would tear you into pieces. If you escaped them the millstones would grind you into powder. If you escaped the millstones the serpent would coil itself about you and fill your veins with poison. It is quite impossible to reach the princess.The youth thought of nothing except the imprisoned princess. I found the door which led me to food and drink said he. Why may I not find the door which leads to the beautiful captive princess I should at least like to peep through the doorOne day a rat ran across the floor and quickly disappeared in a crack in the wall. The youth began to dig farther into the crack and at length he discovered the door. He rested that night though he was so excited he could not sleep a wink. The moment it was light he started to dig again and soon he had freed the door so that it would swing open. He quickly unfastened the bolt and pushed it wide.The two lions which crouched ready to spring upon him were larger and fiercer even than he had expected. He quickly pulled off his jacket and tossed it to them. Both the lions sprang upon the jacket and fought to obtain possession of it. The youth ran past them and through the door they guarded.The heavy millstones were revolving violently and did not stop their revolutions a single instant. Theboy threw his shirt at them. The mill wheels became clogged and he ran quickly past.Before him there appeared a huge serpent. It hissed at him angrily. Quickly he tossed his shoe to it and the serpents deadly fangs were embedded in the shoe. The boy escaped past it and through the door it guarded. He had no jacket or shirt and there was a shoe on only one foot but he was safe.He found himself in a room lined with gleaming gold. It was adorned with pearls and diamonds and precious stones from every part of the earth. Upon a richly carved couch lay the most beautiful maiden in the world. There was a sweet smile upon her lips but she was fast asleep. Slowly she opened her beautiful dark eyes. They smiled into the boys.Thank you for coming to awaken me she said. I should have slept for a thousand years if you hadnot come. I am sorry I cannot stay with you. Ill give you this so that I shall be able to recognize you again. With these words she gave the youth a dainty handkerchief of sheerest linen. In the corner of the handkerchief there was a coronet embroidered with skilful stitchery.Suddenly the beautiful princess the richly carved couch the room lined with gold with ornaments of pearls and diamonds and precious stones from every part of the earth the mysterious castle the high rocks in the midst of the waves all disappeared. There was not a trace of them left. The boy found himself standing by the seashore in a certain town in Spain which he well knew. He was holding in his hand a dainty handkerchief with a coronet embroidered in the corner.The youth could think of nothing except the beautiful dark eyes of the enchanted princess and her sweet smile. He sought for her in every city in every land. He despaired of ever seeing her again but hetreasured the handkerchief carefully. At last he returned to his own city. He had been everywhere else in his search for the princess but he had not yet visited again the familiar scenes of his boyhood. He decided to remain there for a time and then once more renew his search. He knew that he could never rest in peace until he had once more looked into the beautiful dark eyes of the enchanted princess.As he approached his own city he saw that it was decked in gala attire. There were banners and flowers everywhere.What feast is this he asked the first man he met.Why dont you know  asked the man to whom he had spoken. Where have you been that you do not know that this is the wedding day of our beautiful princess There was no time to talk more for at that very moment the wedding procession appeared. The lad looked at the bride and his heart stood still. He gazed once more upon the face of the beautiful enchanted princess whom he had awakened in the castle in the sea.He ran like the wind through the crowd. He pushed aside all who got in his way. He was like a madman. Nevertheless he reached the steps of the church long before the bridal party arrived there.As the bride came up the steps he waved before her eyes the dainty handkerchief of sheerest linen with the royal coronet embroidered in the corner. The face of the beautiful princess turned white and then it turned to deepest rose. Her dark eyes shone with the great joy which filled her heart.Within the church the clear voice of the princess rang out proudly I will wed only the youth who has my handkerchief with my coronet embroidered in the corner.The wedding guests looked at each other in amazement. The bridegroom searched anxiously in all his pockets. In none of them could he find a handkerchief with the coronet of the princess in the corner.The princess turned to her father. Send men to search for him she cried. He was dressed as a beggar and he sat upon the steps of the church He it is who came to my side in the enchanted palace in the sea. It is he who awoke me out of my enchantment. I gave him my handkerchief with my coronet embroidered in the corner. I will wed him and him aloneSearch was quickly made. There on the steps of the church still sat a youth with smiling eyes a youth dressed in shabby dusty garments like a beggar. In his hand he held a dainty handkerchief of sheerest linen with a royal coronet embroidered in the corner.The former bridegroom retired in sorrow and disappointment and the wedding was celebrated with great joy.
Once upon a time there was a king who had a queen whom he loved with a great love. But after a time the queen died and all he had left was an only daughter. And now that the king was a widower his whole heart went out to the little princess whom he cherished as the apple of his eye. And the kings young daughter grew up into the most lovely maiden ever known.When the princess had seen the snows of fifteen winters it happened that a great war broke out and that her father had to march against the foe.But there was no one to whom the king could entrust his daughter while he was away at war so he had a great tower built out in the forest provided it with a plenteous store of supplies and in it shut up his daughter and a maid. And he had it proclaimed that every man no matter who he might be was forbidden to approach the tower in which he had placed his daughter and the maid under pain of death.Now the king thought he had taken every precaution to protect his daughter and went off to war. In the meantime the princess and her maid sat in the tower. But in the city there were a number of brave young sons of kings as well as other young men who would have liked to have talked to the beautiful maiden. And when they found that this was forbidden them they conceived a great hatred for the king. At length they took counsel with an old woman who was wiser than most folk and told her to arrange matters in such wise that the kings daughter and her maid might come into disrepute without their having anything to do with it. The old hag promised to help them enchanted some apples laid them in a basket and went to the lonely tower in which the maidens lived.When the kings daughter and her maid saw the old woman who was sitting beneath the window they felt a great longing to try the beautiful apples.So they called out and asked how much she wanted for her precious apples but the old woman said they were not for sale. Yet as the girls kept on pleading with her the old woman said she would make each of them a present of an apple they only need let down a little basket from the tower. The princess and her maid in all innocence did as the trollwoman told them and each received an apple. But the enchanted fruit had a strange effect for in due course of time heaven sent them each a child. The kings daughter called her son Silverwhite and the son of her maid received the name of Lillwacker.The two boys grew up larger and stronger than other children and were very handsome as well. They looked as much alike as one cherrypit does to another and one could easily see that they were related.Seven years had passed and the king was expected home from the war. Then both girls were terrified and they took counsel together as to how they might hide their children. When at length they could find no other way out of the difficulty they very sorrowfully bade their children farewell and let them down from the tower at night to seek their fortune in the wide wide world. At parting the kings daughter gave Silverwhite a costly knife but the maid had nothing to give her son.The two fosterbrethren now wandered out into the world. After they had gone a while they came to a dark forest. And in this forest they met a man strangelooking and very tall. He wore two swords at his side and was accompanied by six great dogs. He gave them a friendly greetingGoodday little fellows whence do you come and whither do you go The boys told him they came from a high tower and were going out into the world to seek their fortune. The man repliedIf such be the case I know more about your origin than any one else. And that you may have something by which to remember your father I will give each of you a sword and three dogs. But you must promise me one thing that you will never part from your dogs but take them with you wherever you go. The boys thanked the man for his kind gifts and promised to do as he had told them. Then they bade him farewell and went their way.When they had traveled for some time they reached a crossroad. Then Silverwhite saidIt seems to me that it would be the best for us to try our luck singly so let us part. Lillwacker answered Your advice is good but how am I to know whether or not you are doing well out in the worldI will give you a token by which you may tell said Silverwhite so long as the water runs clear in this spring you will know that I am alive but if it turns red and roiled it will mean that I am dead. Silverwhite then drew runes in the water of the spring said farewell to his brother and each of them went on alone. Lillwacker soon came to a kings court and took service there but every morning he would go to the spring to see how his brother fared.Silverwhite continued to wander over hill and dale until he reached a great city. But the whole city was in mourning the houses were hung in black and all the inhabitants went about full of grief and care as though some great misfortune had occurred.Silverwhite went though the city and inquired as to the cause of all the unhappiness he saw. They answered You must have come from far away since you do not know that the king and queen were in danger of being drowned at sea and he had to promise to give up their three daughters in order to escape. Tomorrow morning the seatroll is coming to carry off the oldest princess. This news pleased Silverwhite for he saw a fine opportunity to wealth and fame should fortune favor him.The next morning Silverwhite hung his sword at his side called his dogs to him and wandered down to the seashore alone. And as he sat on the strand he saw the kings daughter led out of the city and with her went a courtier who had promised to rescue her. But the princess was very sad and cried bitterly. Then Silverwhite stepped up to her with a polite greeting. When the kings daughter and her escort saw the fearless youth they were much frightened because they thought he was the seatroll. The courtier was so alarmed that he ran away and took refuge in a tree. When Silverwhite saw how frightened the princess was he said Lovely maiden do not fear me for I will do you no harm. The kings daughter answeredAre you the troll who is coming to carry me away No said Silverwhite I have come to rescue you. Then the princess was glad to think that such a brave hero was going to defend her and they had a long friendly talk. At the same time Silverwhite begged the kings daughter to comb his hair. She complied with his request and Silverwhite laid his head in her lap but when he did so the princess drew a golden ring from her finger and unbeknown to him wound it into his locks.Suddenly the seatroll rose from the deeps setting the waves whirling and foaming far and near. When the troll saw Silverwhite he grew angry and said Why do you sit there beside my princess The youth replied It seems to me that she is my princess not yours. The seatroll answered Time enough to see which of us is right but first our dogs shall fight. Silverwhite was nothing loath and set his dogs at the dogs of the troll and there was a fierce struggle. But at last the youths dogs got the upper hand and bit the dogs of the seatroll to death. Then Silverwhite drew his sword with a great sweep rushed upon the seatroll and gave him such a tremendous blow that the monsters head rolled on the sand. The troll gave a fearsome cry and flung himself back into the sea so that the water spurted to the very skies. Thereupon the youth drew out his silvermounted knife cut out the trolls eyes and put them in his pocket. Then he saluted the lovely princess and went away.Now when the battle was over and the youth had disappeared the courtier crawled down from his tree and threatened to kill the princess if she did not say before all the people that he and none other had rescued her. The kings daughter did not dare refuse since she feared for her life. So she returned to her fathers castle with the courtier where they were received with great distinction.And joy reigned throughout the land when the news spread that the oldest princess had been rescued from the troll.On the following day everything repeated itself. Silverwhite went down to the strand and met the second princess just as she was to be delivered to the troll.And when the kings daughter and her escort saw him they were very much frightened thinking he was the seatroll. And the courtier climbed a tree just as he had before but the princess granted the youths petition combed his hair as her sister had done and also wound her gold ring into his long curls.After a time there was a great tumult out at sea and a seatroll rose from the waves. He had three heads and three dogs. But Silverwhites dogs overcame those of the troll and the youth killed the troll himself with his sword. Thereupon he took out his silvermounted knife cut out the trolls eyes and went his way. But the courtier lost no time. He climbed down from his tree and forced the princess to promise to say that he and none other had rescued her. Then they returned to the castle where the courtier was acclaimed as the greatest of heroes.On the third day Silverwhite hung his sword at his side called his three dogs to him and again wandered down to the seashore. As he was sitting by the strand he saw the youngest princess led out of the city and with her the daring courtier who claimed to have rescued her sisters. But the princess was very sad and cried bitterly. Then Silverwhite stepped up and greeted the lovely maiden politely. Now when the kings daughter and her escort saw the handsome youth they were very much frightened for they believed him to be the seatroll and the courtier ran away and hid in a high tree that grew near the strand. When Silverwhite noticed the maidens terror he saidLovely maiden do not fear me for I will do you no harm. The kings daughter answered Are you the troll who is coming to carry me away No said Silverwhite I have come to rescue you. Then the princess was very glad to have such a brave hero fight for her and they had a long friendly talk with each other. At the same time Silverwhite begged the lovely maiden to do him a favor and comb his hair. This the kings daughter was most willing to do and Silverwhite laid his head in her lap. But when the princess saw the gold rings her sisters had wound in his locks she was much surprised and added her own to the others.Suddenly the seatroll came shooting up out of the deep with a terrific noise so that waves and foam spurted to the very skies. This time the monster had six heads and nine dogs. When the troll saw Silverwhite sitting with the kings daughter he fell into a rage and cried What are you doing with my princess The youth answered It seems to me that she is my princess rather than yours. Thereupon the troll said Time enough to see which of us is right but first our dogs shall fight each other. Silverwhite did not delay but set his dogs at the seadogs and they had a battle royal. But in the end the youths dogs got the upper hand and bit all nine of the seadogs to death. Finally Silverwhite drew out his bare sword flung himself upon the seatroll and stretched all six of his heads on the sand with a single blow. The monster uttered a terrible cry and rushed back into the sea so that the water spurted to the heavens. Then the youth drew his silvermounted knife cut out all twelve of the trolls eyes saluted the kings young daughter and hastily went away.Now that the battle was over and the youth had disappeared the courtier climbed down from his tree drew his sword and threatened to kill the princess unless she promised to say that he had rescued her from the troll as he had her sisters.The kings daughter did not dare refuse since she feared for her life. So they went back to the castle together and when the king saw that they had returned in safety without so much as a scratch he and the whole court were full of joy and they were accorded great honors. And at court the courtier was quite another fellow from the one who had hid away in the tree. The king had a splendid banquet prepared with amusements and games and the sound of string music and dancing and bestowed the hand of his youngest daughter on the courtier in reward for his bravey.In the midst of the wedding festivities when the king and his whole court were seated at table the door opened and in came Silverwhite with his dogs.The youth stepped boldly into the hall of state and greeted the king. And when the three princesses saw who it was they were full of joy leaped up from their places and ran over to him much to the kings surprise who asked what it all meant. Then the youngest princess told him all that had happened from beginning to end and that Silverwhite had rescued them while the courtier sat in a tree. To prove it beyond any chance of doubt each of the kings daughters showed her father the ring she had wound in Silverwhites locks. But the king still did not know quite what to think of it all until Silverwhite said My lord king In order that you need not doubt what your daughters have told you I will show you the eyes of the seatrolls whom I slew. Then the king and all the rest saw that the princesses had told the truth. The traitorous courtier received his just punishment but Silverwhite was paid every honor and was given the youngest daughter and half of the kingdom with her.After the wedding Silverwhite established himself with his young bride in a large castle belonging to the king and there they lived quietly and happily.One night when all were sleeping it chanced that he heard a knocking at the window and a voice which said Come Silverwhite I have to talk to you The king who did not want to wake his young wife rose hastily girded on his sword called his dogs and went out. When he reached the open air there stood a huge and savagelooking troll. The troll said Silverwhite you have slain my three brothers and I have come to bid you go down to the seashore with me that we may fight with one another. This proposal suited the youth and he followed the troll without protest. When they reached the seashore there lay three great dogs belonging to the troll. Silverwhite at once set his dogs at the trolldogs and after a hard struggle the latter had to give in. The young king drew his sword bravely attacked the troll and dealt him many a mighty blow. It was a tremendous battle. But when the troll noticed he was getting the worst of it he grew frightened quickly ran to a high tree and clambered into it. Silverwhite and the dogs ran after him the dogs barking as loudly as they could. Then the troll begged for his life and said Dear Silverwhite I will take wergild for my brothers only bid your dogs be still so that we may talk. The king bade his dogs be still but in vain they only barked the more loudly. Then the troll tore three hairs from his head handed them to Silverwhite and said Lay a hair on each of the dogs and then they will be as quiet as can be. The king did so and at once the dogs fell silent and lay motionless as though they had grown fast to the ground. Now Silverwhite realized that he had been deceived but it was too late. The troll was already descending from the tree and he drew his sword and again began to fight. But they had exchanged no more than a few blows before Silverwhite received a mortal wound and lay on the earth in a pool of blood.But now we must tell about Lillwacker. The next morning he went to the spring by the crossroad and found it red with blood. Then he knew that Silverwhite was dead. He called his dogs hung his sword at his side and went on until he came to a great city. And the city was in festal array the streets were crowded with people and the houses were hung with scarlet cloths and splendid rugs. Lillwacker asked why everybody was so happy and they said You must hail from distant parts since you do not know that a famous hero has come here by the name of Silverwhite who has rescued our three princesses and is now the kings soninlaw. Lillwacker then inquired how it had all come about and then went his way reaching the royal castle in which Silverwhite dwelt with his beautiful queen in the evening.When Lillwacker entered the castle gate all greeted him as though he had been the king. For he resembled his fosterbrother so closely that none could tell one from the other. When the youth came to the queens room she also took him for Silverwhite. She went up to him and said My lord king where have you been so long I have been awaiting you with great anxiety. Lillwacker said little and was very taciturn. Then he lay down on a couch in a corner of the queens room.The young woman did not know what to think of his actions for her husband did not act queerly at other times. But she thought One should not try to discover the secrets of others and said nothing.In the night when all were sleeping there was a knocking at the window and a voice cried Come Lillwacker I have to talk to you The youth rose hastily took his good sword called his dogs and went. When he reached the open air there stood the same troll who had slain Silverwhite. He said Come with me Lillwacker and then you shall see your fosterbrother To this Lillwacker at once agreed and the troll led the way. When they came to the seashore there lay the three great dogs whom the troll had brought with him. Somewhat further away where they had fought lay Silverwhite in a pool of blood and beside him his dogs were stretched out on the ground as though they had taken root in it. Then Lillwacker saw how everything had happened and thought that he would gladly venture his life if he might in some way call his brother back from the dead. He at once set his dogs at the trolldogs and they had a hard struggle in which Lillwackers dogs won the victory. Then the youth drew his sword and attacked the troll with mighty blows. But when the troll saw that he was getting the worst of it he took refuge in a lofty tree. Lillwacker and his dogs ran after him and the dogs barked loudly.Then the troll humbly begged for his life and said Dear Lillwacker I will give you wergild for your brother only bid your dogs be still so that we may talk. At the same time the troll handed him three hairs from his head and added Lay one of these hairs on each of your dogs and then they will soon be quiet. But Lillwacker saw through his cunning scheme took the three hairs and laid them on the trolldogs which at once fell on the ground and lay like dead.When the troll saw that his attempt had failed he was much alarmed and said Dearest Lillwacker I will give you wergild for your brother if you will only leave me alone. But the youth answeredWhat is there you can give me that will compensate for my brothers life The troll replied Here are two flasks. In one is a liquid which if you anoint a dead man with it it will restore him to life but as to the liquid in the other flask if you moisten anything with it and some one touches the place you have moistened he will be unable to move from the spot. I think it would be hard to find anything more precious than the liquid in these flasks. Lillwacker said Your proposal suits me and I will accept it. But there is something else you must promise to do that you will release my brothers dogs. The troll agreed climbed down from the tree breathed on the dogs and thus freed them. Then Lillwacker took the two flasks and went away from the seashore with the troll. After they had gone a while they came to a great flat stone lying near the highway. Lillwacker hastened on in advance and moistened it with liquid from the second flask. Then as he was going by Lillwacker suddenly set all six of his dogs at the troll who stepped back and touched the stone. There he stuck and could move neither forward nor backward. After a time the sun rose and shone on the stone. And when the troll saw the sun he burstand was as dead as a doornailLillwacker now ran back to his brother and sprinkled him with the liquid in the other flask so that he came to life again and they were both very happy as may well be imagined. The two fosterbrothers then returned to the castle recounting the story of their experiences and adventures on the way. Lillwacker told how he had been taken for his brother. He even mentioned that he had lain down on a couch in a corner of the queens room and that she had never suspected that he was not her rightful husband. But when Silverwhite heard that he thought that Lillwacker had offended against the queens dignity and he grew angry and fell into such a rage that he drew his sword and thrust it into his brothers breast. Lillwacker fell to earth dead and Silverwhite went home to the castle alone. But Lillwackers dogs would not leave their master and lay around him whining and licking his wound.In the evening when the young king and his wife retired the queen asked him why he had been so taciturn and serious the evening before. Then the queen said I am very curious to know what has befallen you during the last few days but what I would like to know most of all is why you lay down on a couch in a corner of my room the other night Now it was clear to Silverwhite that the brother he had slain was innocent of all offense and he felt bitter regret at having repaid his faithfulness so badly. So King Silverwhite at once rose and went to the place where his brother was lying. He poured the water of life from his flask and anointed his brothers wound and in a moment Lillwacker was alive again and the two brothers went joyfully back to the castle.When they got there Silverwhite told his queen how Lillwacker had rescued him from death and all the rest of their adventures and all were happy at the royal court and they paid the youth the greatest honors and compliments. After he had stayed there a time he sued for the hand of the second princess and obtained it. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated with great pomp and Silverwhite divided his half of the kingdom with his fosterbrother. The two brothers continued to live together in peace and unity and if they have not died they are living still.
Once upon a time there was a man and his wife who were very poor. The man earned his living making wooden bowls and platters to sell and worked early and late but wooden bowls and platters were so very cheap that he could barely support his family no matter how hard he worked. The man and his wife were the parents of three lovely daughters. They were all exceedingly beautiful and the man and his wife often lamented the fact that they did not have money enough to educate them and clothe them fittingly.One day there came to the door of the poor mans house a handsome young man mounted on a beautiful horse. He asked to buy one of the poor mans daughters. The father was very much shocked at this request. I may be poor said he but I am not so poor that I have to sell my children.The young man however threatened to kill him if he refused to do his bidding so finally after a short struggle the father consented to part with his eldest daughter. He received a great sum of money in return.The father was now a rich man and did not wish to make bowls and platters any longer. His wife however urged him to keep on with his former occupation. Accordingly he went on with his work. The very next day there came to his door another young man even handsomer than the other mounted upon even a finer horse. This young man made the same request that the other had done. He wanted to buy one of the daughters.The father burst into tears and told all the dreadful happenings of the day before. The young man however showed no pity and continued to demand one of the daughters. He made fearful threats if the man would not yield to his request and the father became so frightened that he at length parted with his second daughter. The first young man had paid a great sum of money but this one paid even more.Though he was now very rich the father still went on making bowls and platters to please his wife. The next day when he was at work the handsomest young man he had ever seen appeared riding upon a most beautiful steed. This young man demanded the third daughter. The poor father had to yield just as before though it nearly broke his heart to part with his only remaining child. The price which the young man paid was so very great that the family was now as rich as it had once been poor.Their home was not childless very long for soon a baby son came to them. They brought up the boy in great luxury. One day when the child was at school he quarrelled with one of his playmates. This taunt was thrown in his face Ah ha You think your father was always rich do you He is a rich man now it is true but it is because he sold your three sisters. The words made the boy sad but he said nothing about the matter at home. He hid it away in his mind until he had become a man. Then he went to his father and mother and demanded that they should tell him all about it.His parents told the young man the whole story of the strange experiences through which they had obtained their wealth. I am now a man said the son. I feel that it is right that I should go out into the world in search of my sisters. Perhaps I might be able to find them and aid them in some way. Give me your blessing and allow me to go.His father and mother gave him their blessing and the young man started out to make a search through all the world. Soon he came to a house where there were three brothers quarrelling over a boot a cap and a key. What is the matter asked the young man. Why are these things so valuable that you should quarrel over themThe brothers replied that if one said to the boot O Boot put me somewhere the boot would immediately put him anywhere he wished to go. If one said to the cap O Cap hide me immediately the cap would hide him so he could not be seen. The key could unlock any door in the whole world. The young man at once wanted to own these things himself and he offered so much money for them that at last the three brothers decided to end their quarrel by selling the boot the cap and the key and dividing the money.The young man put the three treasures in his saddle bag and went on his way. As soon as he was out of sight of the house he said to the boot O Boot put me in the house of my eldest sister.Immediately the young man found himself in the most magnificent palace he had ever seen in his life. He asked to speak with his sister but the queen of the palace replied that she had no brother and did not wish to be bothered with the stranger. It took much urging for the young man to gain permission from her to relate his story but when she had once heard it everything sounded so logical that she decided to receive him as her brother. She asked how he had ever found her home and how he had come through the thicket which surrounded her palace. The young man told her about his magic boot.In the afternoon the queen suddenly burst into tears. Her brother asked what the trouble was. O dear O dear What shall we do What shall we do sobbed the queen. My husband is King of the Fishes. When he comes home to dinner tonight he will be very angry to find a human in his palace. The young man told her about his magic cap and comforted her fears.Soon the King of Fishes arrived accompanied by all his advisors He came into the palace in a very bad temper giving kicks and blows to everything which came in his way and saying in a fierce savage voice Lee low lee leer I smell the blood of a human here. I smell the blood of a human here.It took much persuasion on the part of the queen to get him to take a bath. After his bath he appeared in the form of a handsome man. He then ate his dinner and when he had nearly finished the meal his wife said to him If you should see my brother here what would you do to himI would be kind to him of course just as I am to you responded the King of the Fishes. If he is here let him appear.The young man then took off the magic cap by which he had hidden himself. The king treated him most kindly and courteously. He invited him to live for the rest of his life in the palace. The young man declined the invitation saying that he had two other sisters to visit. He took his departure soon and when he went away his brotherinlaw gave him a scale with these words If you are ever in any danger in which I can help you take this scale and say Help me O King of the Fishes.The young man put the scale in his saddle bag. Then he took out his magic boot and said O Boot put me in the home of my second sister. He found his second sister queen of even a more wonderful palace than his eldest sister. Her husband was King of Rams and treated the newly found brother of his queen with great consideration. When the young man had finished his visit there the King of Rams gave him a piece of wool saying If you are ever in any peril in which I can help you pull this wool and ask help of the King of Rams.With the aid of his magic boot the young man went to visit the home of his youngest sister. He found her in the most magnificent palace of them all. Her husband was King of Pigeons. When the young man departed he gave him a feather telling him if he was ever in any danger that all he had to do was to pull the feather and say Help me O King of the Pigeons.All three of the young mans brothersinlaw had admired the power of his magic boot and they had all advised him to visit the land of the King of Giants by means of it. After having left each of his three sisters full of happiness in her costly palace he felt free to act upon this advice so by means of his magic boot he again found himself in a new country.He soon heard on the street that the King of the land of Giants had a beautiful giantess daughter whom he wished to give in marriage if she could be persuaded to choose a husband. She was such a famous beauty that no one could pass before her palace without eagerly gazing up in hopes of seeing her lovely face at the window. The giant princess had grown weary of being the object of so much attention and she had made a vow that she would marry no one except a man who could pass before her without lifting his eyes.The young man became interested when he heard this and at once rode past the palace with his eyes fixed steadily on the ground. He did not give a single glance upward in the direction of the window where the beautiful giant princess was watching him. The princess was overcome with joy at the sight of the handsome stranger who appeared as if in response to her vow. The king summoned him to the palace at once and ordered that the wedding should be celebrated immediately.After the wedding the giant princess soon found out that her husband carried his choicest treasures in his saddle bags. She inquired their significance and her husband told her all about them. She was especially interested in the key. She said that there was a room in the palace which was never opened. In this room there was a fierce beast which always came to life again whenever it was killed. The giant princess had always been anxious to see the beast with her own eyes and she suggested that they should use the key to unlock the door of the forbidden room and take a peep at the beast.Her husband however gave her no encouragement to do this. He decided that it was too risky a bit of amusement but one day when he had gone hunting with the king and court the princess was overjoyed to find that the magic key had been left behind. She at once picked it up and opened the forbidden door. The beast gave a great leap roaring out at her You are the very one I have sought as he seized her with his sharp claws.When her husband and father returned from their hunting trip they were very much worried to find that the princess had disappeared. No one knew where she was. After searching through the palace and garden all in vain they went to the place where the beast was always kept. The prince recognized his magic key in the door but the room was empty. The beast had fled with the giant princess.Once more the young man made use of his magic boot and soon was by the side of the princess. The beast had hidden her in a cave by the sea and had gone away in search of food. The giant princess was delighted to find her husband whom she had never expected to see again and wanted to hasten away from the cave with him at once.You have got yourself into this affair said her husband. I can get you out again I think but I believe that it is your duty to at least make an effort to take the beasts life. Perhaps when he comes back to the cave you can extract from him the secret of his charmed life.The princess awaited the return of the beast. Then she asked him to tell her the secret of his charmed life. The beast was very much flattered to have the giant princess so interested in him and he told it to her at once. He never thought of a plot. This is what he said My life is in the sea. In the sea there is a chest. In the chest there is a stone. In the stone there is a pigeon. In the pigeon there is an egg. In the egg there is a candle. At the moment when that candle is extinguished I die.All this time the prince had remained there hiding under his magic cap. He heard every word the beast said. As soon as the beast had gone to sleep the prince stood on the seashore and said Help me O King of the Fishes as he took out the scale which his brotherinlaw had given him. Immediately there appeared a great multitude of fishes asking what he wished them to do. He asked them to get the chest from the depths of the sea. They replied that they had never seen such a chest but that probably the swordfish would know about it.They hastened to call the swordfish and he came at once. He said that he had seen the chest only a moment before. All the fishes went with him to get it and they soon brought the chest out of the sea. The prince opened the chest easily with the aid of his magic key and inside he found a stone.Then the prince pulled the piece of wool which his second brotherinlaw had given him and said Help me O King of the Rams. Immediately there appeared a great drove of rams running to the seashore from all directions. They attacked the stone giving it mighty blows with their hard heads and horns. Soon they broke open the stone and from out of it there flew a pigeon.The beast now awoke from his sleep and knew that he was very ill. He remembered all that he had told the princess and accused her of having made a plot against his life. He seized his great ax to kill the princess.In the meantime the prince had pulled the feather which his third brotherinlaw had given him and cried Help me O King of the Pigeons. Immediately a great flock of pigeons appeared attacking the pigeon and tearing it to pieces.Just as the beast had caught the princess and was about to slay her the prince took the egg from within the slain pigeon. He at once broke the egg and blew out the candle. At that moment the beast fell dead and the princess escaped unharmed.The prince carried the giant princess home to her fathers kingdom and the king made a great festa which lasted many days. There was rejoicing throughout the whole kingdom because of the death of the beast and because of the safety of the lovely princess. The prince was praised throughout the kingdom and there is talk of him even unto this very day.The prince had cut off the head of the great beast and the tip of its tail. The head he had given to the king but the tip of the tail he kept for himself. The beast was so enormous that just the tip of its tail made a great ring large enough to encircle the princes body. One day just in fun he twined the tip of the beasts tail around his waist. He immediately grew and grew until he became a giant himself almost as tall as the king of the land of giants and several leagues taller than the princess. It is not strange that a man who became a giant among giants should be famous even until now.
One day a little boy named Elonen sat out in the yard making a bird snare and as he worked a little bird called to him Tiktikloden come and catch me.I am making a snare for you said the boy but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished.Then Elonen ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it and he put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim.While he was away his grandmother grew hungry so she ate the bird and when Elonen returned and found that his bird was gone he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked a long distance until finally he came to a big stone and said Stone open your mouth and eat me. And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy.When his grandmother missed the boy she went out and looked everywhere hoping to find him. Finally she passed near the stone and it cried out Here he is. Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it but it would not break. Then she called the carabao and they hooked it but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it and the thunder which shook it but nothing could open it and she had to go home without the boy.
A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when rescued from his danger he forgot his promise. Shortly afterwards again caught in a snare he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon appeared and said to him O thou most base fellow how can I believe thee who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron
Authors note This story is from SwedenOnce upon a time there lived a peasant who had three sons. The two elder ones used to go with him to the field and to the forest and helped him in his work but the youngest remained at home with his mother to help her in the house. His brothers despised him for doing this and whenever they had a chance they used him badly.At length the father and mother died and the sons divided the property among them. As might have been looked for the elder brothers took all that was of any value for themselves leaving nothing to the youngest but an old cracked kneadingtrough which neither of them thought worth the having.The old trough said one of the brothers will do very well for our young brother for he is always baking and scrubbing.The boy thought this as was only natural a poor thing to inherit but he could do nothing and he now recognised that it would be no use his remaining at home so he wished his brothers goodbye and went off to seek his fortune. On coming to the side of a lake he made his trough watertight with oakum and converted it into a little boat. Then he found two sticks and using these as oars rowed away.When he had crossed the water he saw a large palace and entering it he asked to speak with the king. The king questioned him respecting his family and the purpose of his visit.I said the boy am the son of a poor peasant and all I have in the world is an old kneadingtrough. I have come here to seek work.The king laughed when he heard this.Indeed said he you have not inherited much but fortune works many a change.He took the lad to be one of his servants and he became a favourite for his courage and honesty.Now the king who owned this palace had an only daughter who was so beautiful and so clever that she was talked of all through the kingdom and many came from the east and from the west to ask her hand in marriage. The princess however rejected them all saying that none should have her for his wife unless he brought her for a weddingpresent four valuable things belonging to a giant who lived on the other side of the lake. These four treasures were a gold sword three gold hens a gold lantern and a gold harp.Many kings sons and many good warriors tried to win these treasures but none of them came back for the giant caught them all and eat them. The king was very sorrowful for he feared that at this rate his daughter would never get a husband and so he would not have a soninlaw to whom to leave his kingdom.The boy when he heard of this thought that it might be well worth his while to try to win the kings beautiful daughter. So he went to the king one day and told him what he meant to do. When the king heard him he got angry and saidDo you think that you who are only a servant can do what great warriors have failed inThe boy however was not to be dissuaded and begged him so to let him go that at last the king grew calmer and gave him his permission. But said he you will lose your life and I shall be sorry to miss you.With that they parted.The boy went down to the shore of the lake and having found his trough he looked it over very closely. Then he got into it and rowed across the lake and coming to the giants dwelling he hid himself and stayed the night there.Very early in the morning before it was light the giant went to his barn and began to thrash making such a noise that the mountains all around echoed again. When the boy heard this he collected some stones and put them in his pouch. Then he climbed up on to the roof of the barn and made a little hole so that he could look in. Now the giant had by his side his golden sword which had the strange property that it clanked whenever the giant was angry. While the giant was busy thrashing at full speed the boy threw a little stone which hit the sword and caused it to clank.Why do you clank said the giant. I am not angry.He went on thrashing but the next moment the sword clanked again. Once more the giant pursued his work and the sword clanked a third time. Then the giant got so angry that he undid the belt and threw the sword out of the barn door.Lie there said he till I have done my thrashing.The lad waited no longer but slipping down from the roof seized on the sword ran to his boat and rowed across the water. On reaching the other side he hid his treasure and was full of glee at the success of his adventure.The next day he filled his pouch with corn put a bundle of basttwine in his boat and once more set off to the giants dwelling. He lay hiding for a time and then he saw the giants three golden hens walking about on the shore and spreading their feathers which sparkled beautifully in the bright sunshine. He was soon near them and began to softly lead them on scattering corn for them out of his pouch. While they were picking the boy gradually led them to the water till at last he got them into his little boat. Then he jumped in himself secured the fowl with his twine pushed out from the shore and rowed as quickly as he could to the other side of the water.The third day he put some lumps of salt into his pouch and again rowed across the lake. As night came on he noticed how the smoke rose from the giants dwelling and concluded that the giants wife was busy getting ready his food. He crept up on to the roof and looking down through the hole by which the smoke escaped saw a large caldron boiling on the fire. Then he took the lumps of salt out of his pouch and threw them one by one into the pot. Having done this he crept down from the roof and waited to see what would follow.Soon after the giants wife took the caldron off the fire poured out the porridge into a bowl and put it on the table. The giant was hungry and he fell to at once but scarcely had he tasted the porridge when he found it too salt. He got very angry and started from his seat. The old woman made what excuse she could and said that the porridge must be good but the giant declared he would eat no more of the stuff and told her to taste it for herself. She did so and pulled a terrible face for she had never in her life tasted such abominable stuff.There was nothing for it but she must make some new porridge. So she seized a can took the gold lantern down from the wall and went as fast as she could to the well to draw some water. She put the lantern down by the side of the well and was stooping down to get the water when the boy ran to her and laying hold of her by the feet threw her head over heels into the well. He seized hold of the golden lantern ran away as fast as he could to his boat and rowed across the water in safety.The giant sat for a long time wondering why his wife was away so long. At last he went to look for her but nothing could he see of her. Then he heard a splashing in the well and finding she was in the water he with a lot of work got her out.Where is my gold lantern was the first thing he asked as the old woman came round a little.I dont know answered she. Somebody came caught me by the feet and threw me into the well.The giant was very angry at this.Three of my treasures said he have gone and I have now only my golden harp left. But whoever the thief may be he shall not have that I will keep that safe under twelve locks.While these things occurred at the giants dwelling the boy sat on the other side of the water rejoicing that he had got on so well.The most difficult task however had yet to be done and for a long time he thought over how he could get the golden harp. At length he determined to row over to the giants place and see if fortune would favour him.No sooner said than done. He rowed over and went to a hidingplace. The giant had however been on the watch and had seen him. So he rushed forward in a terrible rage and seized the boy sayingSo I have caught you at last you young rascal. You it was who stole my sword my three gold hens and my gold lantern.The boy was terribly afraid for he thought his last hour was come.Spare my life father said he humbly and I will never come here again.No replied the giant I will do the same with you as with the others. No one slips alive out of my hands.He then shut the boy up in a sty and fed him with nuts and sweet milk so as to get him nice and fat preparatory to killing and eating him.The lad was a prisoner but he ate and drank and made himself as easy as he could. After some time the giant wanted to find out if he were fat enough to be killed. So he went to the sty made a little hole in the wall and told the boy to put his finger through it. The lad knew what he wanted so instead of putting out his finger he poked out a little peeled alder twig. The giant cut the twig and the red sap ran out. Then he thought the boy must be yet very lean since his flesh was so hard so he caused a greater supply of milk and nuts to be given to him.Some time after the giant again visited the sty and ordered the boy to put his finger through the hole in the wall. The lad now poked out a cabbagestalk and the giant having cut it with his knife concluded that the lad must be fat enough his flesh seemed so soft.The next morning the giant said to his wifeThe boy seems to be fat enough now mother take him then today and bake him in the oven while I go and ask our kinsfolk to the feast.The old woman promised to do what her husband told her. So having heated the oven she dragged out the boy to bake him.Sit on the shovel said she.The boy did so but when the old woman raised the shovel the boy always fell off. So they went on many times. At last the giantess got angry and scolded the boy for being so awkward the lad excused himself saying that he did not know the way to sit on the shovel.Look at me said the woman I will show you.So she sat herself down on the shovel bending her back and drawing up her knees. No sooner was she seated than the boy seizing hold of the handle pushed her into the oven and slammed the door to. Then he took the womans fur cloak stuffed it out with straw and laid it on the bed. Seizing the giants bunch of keys he opened the twelve locks snatched up the golden harp and ran down to his boat which he had hidden among the flags on the shore.The giant soon afterwards came home.Where can my wife be said he. No doubt she has lain down to sleep a bit. Ah I thought so.The old woman however slept a long while and the giant could not wake her though he was now expecting his friends to arrive.Wake up mother cried he but no one replied. He called again but there was no response. He got angry and going to the bed he gave the fur cloak a good shake. Then he found that it was not his wife but only a bundle of straw put in her clothes. At this the giant grew alarmed and he ran off to look after his golden harp. He found his keys gone the twelve locks undone and the harp missing. He went to the oven and opened the door to see how the meat for the feast was going on. Behold there sat his wife baked and grinning at him.Then the giant was almost mad with grief and rage and he rushed out to seek the lad who had done him all this mischief. He came down to the edge of the water and found him sitting in his boat playing on the harp. The music came over the water and the gold strings shone wonderfully in the sunshine. The giant jumped into the water after the boy but finding that it was too deep he laid himself down and began to drink the water in order to make the lake shallower. He drank with all his might and by this means set up a current which drew the boat nearer and nearer to the shore. Just when he was going to lay hold of it he burst for he had drunk too much and there was an end of him.The giant lay dead on the shore and the boy moved away across the lake full of joy and happiness. When he came to land he combed his golden hair put on fine clothes fastened the giants gold sword by his side and taking the gold harp in one hand and the gold lantern in the other he led the gold fowl after him and went to the king who was sitting in the great hall of the palace surrounded by his courtiers. When the king saw the boy he was heartily glad. The lad went to the kings beautiful daughter saluted her courteously and laid the giants treasures before her. Then there was great joy in the palace that the princess had after all got the giants treasures and so bold and handsome a bridegroom. The wedding was celebrated soon after with very much splendour and rejoicing and when the king died the lad succeeded him ruling over all the land both long and happily.I know no more respecting them.
He who asks little shall obtain much.There lived once three brothers whose only property in this bright world consisted of a peartree which they watched one after another whilst one of them was left watching it the two others would go to their daily labour.One day an angel from heaven was commanded to go and see how the brothers were living and to provide them with better means of subsistence if they needed it. As soon as the angel had descended to the earth he assumed the shape of a beggar and having come to the brother who was watching the tree he begged him for a pear. The man plucked one of the pears which belonged to him gave it to the angel and saidHere you have one of my own pears of those which belong to my brothers I cannot give you any.The angel thanked him and went away. On the following day the second brother stopped at home to watch the tree the angel came also to him and asked for a pear. The second brother likewise plucked one of the pears which belonged to him and gave it to the angel and saidHere you have one of my own pears of those which belong to my brothers I cannot give you any.The angel thanked him and went away. When the turn came for the third brother to watch the tree the angel came to him also and asked for a pear. The youngest brother in like manner plucked one of those which belonged to him gave it to the angel and saidHere you have one of my own pears of those which belong to my brothers I cannot give you any.On the fourth day the angel took the form of a monk and having come early in the morning he found the brothers still at home to whom he saidCome with me and I will give you something better to do.The brothers followed the angel without any hesitation. When they had come to a broad rapid stream they all rested there and the angel said to the eldest brotherWhat would you like to haveAnd he answered I should like this water to be turned into wine and belong to me.The angel made the sign of the cross with his staff and loinstead of water there flowed wine in the stream. Casks were being made wine was being poured into them people were seen working and a village arose. The angel left the eldest brother there and said Now you have what you wished for stop and live here.Then the angel took the two younger brothers and went with them farther on. They soon came to a field in which an enormous number of pigeons were feeding. There the angel asked the second brotherWhat would you like to haveAnd he answered I should like all these pigeons to be changed into sheep and belong to me.The angel made the sign of the cross with his staff over the field and in an instant all the pigeons became sheep. A dairy appeared in which some women were milking the ewes others were measuring the milk collecting cream making cheeses and melting fat there was also a slaughterhouse in which meat was dressed weighed and money received people were busy everywhere and a village sprang up on the spot. Hereupon the angel said to the second brother Here you have what you wished for.Then the angel went away with the youngest brother and whilst walking through a field he asked himAnd what would you like to haveSo the youngest brother answered May Heaven grant me a truly pious wife I do not ask for anything else.Ah said the angel it is very difficult to find a truly pious woman. In the whole world there are only three such two of them are already married but the third is still a maiden there are however already two suitors for her.Then they started again and having walked for a long time they reached a town where a king lived who had a truly pious daughter. Having entered into the town they went immediately to the king to ask for his daughter.There they found that two kings had arrived before them had asked for the princess and had already put their apples on the table. Hereupon they also put their apples on the table by the side of the other apples.When the king saw them he said to those who stood aroundWhat shall we do The first two suitors are kings and these men are mere beggars in comparison with them.Then the angel said I will tell you what to do. Let the princess take three branches of vine plant them in the garden and name each one after her lovers in the morning on whose branch grapes will be found him she must take for her husband.They all agreed to this proposition. The princess planted three branches of vine in the garden and named each one after a suitor. In the morning there were grapes on the vine of the poor man. The king not knowing how to get out of this difficulty was obliged to give his daughter to the youngest brother for wife he took them at once to church and married them. After the ceremony the angel took the newlymarried couple to a forest and left them there and they lived in that forest one year.When the year was up the angel was again commanded to go and see how the brothers were living and to assist them if they needed it. Having descended to the earth the angel again assumed the shape of a beggar went to the eldest brother where the wine was flowing in the stream and begged him for a glass of wine but the man drove him away sayingIf I were to give a glass of wine to everybody that asks for it there would be nothing left for me.When the angel heard this he made the sign of the cross with his staff and the water flowed again in the stream as before then he said to the eldest brotherRiches were not good for you go home and attend to your peartree again.Then the angel went to the second brother whose sheep covered the field and begged him for a piece of cheese he also drove the angel away sayingIf I were to give a piece of cheese to everybody that asks for it there would be nothing left for me.When the angel heard this he made the sign of the cross with his staff and the sheep changed into pigeons again then the angel said to himRiches were not good for you go home and attend to your peartree again.At last the angel went to the youngest brother in order to see how he was getting on and he found him living with his wife in a poor hut in the forest. The angel asked him for a nights lodging and they received him with all their hearts and begged him to excuse them that they could not entertain him as they wished for they added we are very poor. And the angel answered them Never mind I shall be satisfied with whatever it is.What were they to do They had no corn to make bread with but they used to pound the bark of trees and make bread of it. Such bread the woman prepared also for the visitor and put it under an earthen cover to bake.Whilst the bread was baking they entertained the visitor with conversation. When some time afterwards they looked to see whether the bread was baked yet they found under the cover fine bread nicely bakedone could not wish for better and it had even risen up under the cover when the man and his wife saw it they lifted up their hands to heaven and saidLord receive our thanks Now we can entertain our visitor.Then they put the bread before the angel and a gourdbottle with water but as soon as they began to drink out of it the water was changed into wine. Hereupon the angel made the sign of the cross with his staff over the hut and in its place there arose a princely palace with plenty of all good things in it. Then the angel blessed the man and his wife and departed from them and they lived happily until their lives end.
Two mules were bearing on their backsOne oats the other silver of the tax.The latter glorying in his loadMarchd proudly forward on the roadAnd from the jingle of his bellTwas plain he liked his burden well.But in a wildwood glenA band of robber menRushd forth upon the twain.Well with the silver pleasedThey by the bridle seizedThe treasure mule so vain.Poor mule in struggling to repelHis ruthless foes he fellStabbd through and with a bitter sighingHe cried Is this the lot they promised meMy humble friend from danger freeWhile weltering in my gore Im dyingMy friend his fellowmule repliedIt is not well to have ones work too high.If thou hadst been a millers drudge as IThou wouldst not thus have died.
Once there lived on earth a poet who sang songs so beautiful that all created things were charmed by them. Two hill trolls who hated the poet because he was noble and good invited him to their home under ground and there killed him. They caught his blood in two cups and mixed it with honey and made mead. If any man drank the mead it would make him a poet too. But the trolls hid it in a dark place and would give it to no one. One day the trolls enticed a giant into a boat with them and drowned him. When his wife came to inquire about him they sent her down to the seashore. Then they threw a rock from the cliff and killed her. Suttung the son of the giant came to see what had become of his father and mother. He threatened to kill the trolls. To save their lives they gave him the precious song mead. Suttung took it home and put it  into his cellar. His daughter Gunlad guarded it night and day. Odin wished to drink the mead. So ho made a journey to Jotunheim. There he saw nine thralls mowing in a field. He offered to whet their scythes. When they found what a keen edge the scythes had they wanted to buy the whetstone. Odin threw it up and said that whoever caught it might keep it. In trying to catch the whetstone the nine thralls killed one another with their scythes. Then Odin went to the master of the thralls and asked for work. The giant hired Odin because he was so much in need of workmen. This giant whose name was Bauge was Suttungs brother. Odin said he would work all summer for one draught of the song mead. Bauge told Odin to begin the work and he would see about the mead. When he found that Bolverk as Odin called himself could do the work of the nine thralls he wished to keep him. But Suttung would not give one drop of the mead. One day when he was away Bauge and Odin went to his house. They took with them an auger that Odin had brought from Asgard. Odin bade Bauge bore a hole through the wall of the cellar. Bauge pretended to have bored through. But when Odin blew into the hole the chips flew into his face. Bauge bored again. This time the chips flew the other way. Then Odin changed himself into a worm and crept through. Before Gunlad knew he was there he had drunk every drop of the mead. After drinking the mead Odin with all his power could not remain a worm. He changed at once to a beautiful bird and flew away. When he reached Asgard he sang such songs as the gods had never heard.
Down near the Indian village of Laguna there is a big sandstone rock overhanging the roadside. Once upon a time a little lizard lived on the sunny side of this big rock. She was a happy little lizard and sang songs all day long.One day a fox was going along the road and he heard the lizard singingNow everything nice or pretty that anybody else has the fox immediately wants so he wanted the lizards song. I must get the lizard to teach me that song so up on the rock he jumped to find the little lizard.Good morning my friend said the fox this is a beautiful day and your song sounded so fine that I wish you would teach it to me.With pleasure replied the obliging lizard and she sang the song over and over until the fox said he knew it.Thank you my friend said he and now goodday for I must be off to hunt my dinner and away he trotted down the road singing as he went Moki moki moki  .He came to a small pond where a flock of wild ducks were feeding on the grass seeds. He did not see the ducks but they saw him and they flew up suddenly out of the water flapping their wings and quacking. The noise frightened the fox so much that he forgot his song. Try as hard as he might he could remember only the first part.He went running back to the lizards house on the big rock. My friend I have forgotten the song you taught me wont you please sing it again for meThe little lizard sang it again and once more the fox trotted down the road singingMoki moki mookiMoki moki mookiHanging rock is here. Hanging rock is here. A happy home for me.Unhum unhum.But he had not gone very far before a rabbit suddenly jumped across his path from behind a bush. The rabbit startled him so that again he forgot the song he was singing.So a third time the fox went to find the lizard. This time he found her asleep in the warm sunshine. I am sorry to disturb you Miss Lizard but I have forgotten my song again and I want you to teach it to me once more.But the sleepy little lizard did not answer.I will ask you four times to sing growled the fox and if you do not sing I will eat you up.The little lizard kept her eyes closed and paid no attention to him. The fox asked her four times to sing and then he opened his big mouth and swallowed her down.The warm sun on the rock made the fox sleepy too so he lay down and went to sleep. While he was sleeping the little lizard took a knife out of a pocket in her skin with which she removes her old skin for a new skin dress each year and she cut and cut the foxs side until she cut a hole big enough to slip out through. Then she took a sharp rock and put it inside the fox where she had been. After that she took a piece of sinew thread from her pocket and sewed the foxs side together again. Then she ran quietly home.All this time the fox was fast asleep. When he awoke he felt thirsty so he trotted back to the little pond for a drink. The stone in his side cut and felt very uncomfortable and when he leaned down to drink it overbalanced him and he fell splash down into the deep water and drowned.
Contemporary with a sparrow tameThere lived a cat from tenderest ageOf both the basket and the cageHad household gods the same.The birds sharp beak full oft provoked the catWho playd in turn but with a gentle patHis wee friend sparing with a merry laughNot punishing his faults by half.In short he scrupled much the harmShould he with points his ferule arm.The Sparrow less discreet than heWith dagger beak made very free.Sir Cat a person wise and staidExcused the warmth with which he playdFor tis full half of friendships artTo take no joke in serious part.Familiar since they saw the lightMere habit kept their friendship goodFair play had never turnd to fightTill of their neighborhoodAnother sparrow came to greetOld Ratto grave and Saucy Pete.Between the birds a quarrel roseAnd Ratto took his side.A pretty stranger with such blowsTo beat our friend he cried.A neighbors sparrow eating oursNot so by all the feline powers.And quick the stranger he devours.Now truly saith Sir CatI know how sparrows taste by that.Exquisite tender delicateThis thought soon seald the others fate.But hence what moral can I bringFor lacking that important thingA fable lacks its finishingI seem to see of one some traceBut still its shadow mocks my chase.
A Kid was perched up on the top of a house and looking down saw a Wolf passing under him. Immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy. Murderer and thief he cried what do you here near honest folks houses How dare you make an appearance where your vile deeds are known Curse away my young friend said the Wolf. It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.
The eagle and the owl resolved to ceaseTheir war embraced in pledge of peace.On faith of king on faith of owl they sworeThat they would eat each others chicks no more.But know you mine said Wisdoms bird.Not I indeed the eagle cried.The worse for that the owl repliedI fear your oaths a useless wordI fear that you as king will notConsider duly who or whatAdieu my young if you should meet themDescribe them then and Ill not eat themThe eagle said. The owl repliedMy little ones I say with prideFor grace of form cannot be matchdThe prettiest birds that eer were hatchdBy this you cannot fail to know themTis needless therefore that I show them.At length God gives the owl a set of heirsAnd while at early eve abroad he faresIn quest of birds and mice for foodOur eagle haply spies the broodAs on some craggy rock they sprawlOr nestle in some ruined wallBut which it matters not at allAnd thinks them ugly little frightsGrim sad with voice like shrieking sprites.These chicks says he with looks almost infernalCant be the darlings of our friend nocturnal.Ill sup of them. And so he did not slightlyHe never sups if he can help it lightly.The owl returnd and sad he foundNought left but claws upon the ground.He prayd the gods above and gods belowTo smite the brigand who had caused his woe.Quoth one On you alone the blame must fallThinking your like the loveliest of allYou told the eagle of your young ones gracesYou gave the picture of their facesHad it of likeness any traces
The monk Anchin was young in years but old in scholarship. Every day for many hours he read the Great Books of the Good Law and never wearied and hard characters were not hard to him.The monk Anchin was young in years but old in holiness he kept his body under by fastings and watchings and long prayers. He was acquainted with the blessedness of sublime meditations. His countenance was white as ivory and as smooth his eyes were deep as a brown pool in autumn his smile was that of a Buddha his voice was like an angels. He dwelt with a score of holy men in a monastery of the mountains where he learned the mystic Way of the Gods. He was bound to his order by the strictest vows but was content rejoicing in the shade of the great pine trees and the sound of the running water of the streams.Now it happened that on a day in springtime the old man his Abbot sent the young monk Anchin upon an errand of mercy. And he said My son bind your sandals fast and tie spare sandals to your girdle take your hat and your staff and your rosary and begging bowl for you have far to go over mountain and stream and across the great plain.So the monk Anchin made him ready.My son the Abbot said if any wayfarer do you a kindness forget not to commend him to the gods for the space of nine existences.I will remember said the monk and so he set forth upon his way.Over mountain and stream he passed and as he went his spirit was wrapped in contemplation and he recited the Holy Sutras aloud in a singing voice. And the Wise Birds called and twittered from branch to branch of the tall trees the birds that are beloved of Buddha. One bird chanted the grand Scripture of the Nicheten the Praise of the Sutra of the Lotus of the Good Law and the other bird called upon his Masters name for he criedO thou Compassionate Mind O thou Compassionate MindThe monk smiled. Sweet and happy bird he said.And the bird answered O thou Compassionate Mind O thou Compassionate MindWhen the monk Anchin came to the great plain the sun was high in the heavens and all the blue and golden flowers of the plain languished in the noontide heat. The monk likewise became very weary and when he beheld the Marshy Mere where were bulrush and sedge that cooled their feet in the water he laid him down to rest under a sycamore tree that grew by the Marshy Mere.Over the mere and upon the farther side of it there hung a glittering haze.Long did the monk Anchin lie and as he lay he looked through the glittering haze and as he looked the haze quivered and moved and grew and gathered upon the farther side of the mere. At the last it drew into a slender column of vapour and out of the vapour there came forth a very dazzling lady. She wore a robe of green and gold interwoven and golden sandals on her slender feet. In her hands were jewelsin each hand one bright jewel like a star. Her hair was tied with a braid of scarlet and she had a crown of scarlet flowers. She came skirting the Marshy Mere. She came gliding in and out of the bulrush and the sedge. In the silence there could be heard the rustle of her green skirt upon the green grass.The monk Anchin stumbled to his feet and trembling he leaned against the sycamore tree.Nearer and nearer came the lady till she stood before Anchin and looked into his eyes. With the jewel that was in her right hand she touched his forehead and his lips. With the jewel that was in her left hand she touched his ricestraw hat and his staff and his rosary and his begging bowl. After this she had him safe in thrall. Then the wind blew a tress of her hair across his face and when he felt it he gave one sob.For the rest of his journey the monk went as a man in a dream. Once a rich traveller riding on horseback threw a silver coin into Anchins begging bowl once a woman gave him a piece of cake made of millet and once a little boy knelt down and tied the fastening of his sandal that had become loose. But each time the monk passed on without a word for he forgot to commend the souls of these compassionate ones for the space of nine existences. In the treetops the Wise Birds of Buddha sang for him no more only from the thicket was heard the cry of the Hototogisu the bird lovelorn and forsaken.Nevertheless well or ill he performed his errand of mercy and returned to the monastery by another way.Howbeit sweet peace left him from the hour in which he had seen the lady of the Marshy Mere. The Great Books of the Good Law sufficed him no longer no more was he acquainted with the blessedness of divine meditations. His heart was hot within him his eyes burned and his soul longed after the lady of the green and golden robe.She had told him her name and he murmured it in his sleep. KiohimKiohim Waking he repeated it instead of his prayersto the great scandal of the brethren who whispered together and said Is our brother madAt length Anchin went to the good Abbot and in his ear poured forth all his tale in a passion of mingled love and grief humbly asking what he must do.The Abbot said Alack my son now you suffer for sin committed in a former life for Karma must needs be worked out.Anchin asked him Then is it past helpNot that said the Abbot but you are in a very great strait.Are you angry with me said Anchin.Nay Heaven forbid my poor son.Then what must I doFast and pray and for a penance stand in the icecold water of our mountain torrent an hour at sunrise and an hour at sunset. Thus shall you be purged from carnal affection and escape the perils of illusion.So Anchin fasted and prayed he scourged his body and hour after hour he did penance in the icecold water of the torrent. Wan as a ghost he grew and his eyes were like flames. His trouble would not leave him. A battle raged in his breast. He could not be faithful to his vows and faithful to his love.The brethren wondered What can ail the monk Anchin who was so learned and so holyis he bewitched by a fox or a badger or can he have a devilBut the Abbot said Let be.Now on a hot night of summer the monk being sleepless in his cell he was visited by Kiohim the magic lady of the mere. The moonlight was on her hands and her long sleeves. Her robe was green and gold interwoven golden were her sandals. Her hair was braided with scarlet and adorned with scarlet flowers.Long long have I waited for thee on the plains she said. The night wind sighs in the sedgethe frogs sing by the Marshy Mere. Come lord.But he cried My vows that I have vowedalas the love that I love. I keep faith and loyalty the bird in my bosom  I may not come.She smiled May not she said and with that she lifted the monk Anchin in her arms.But he gathering all his strength together tore himself from her and fled from the place. Barefooted and bareheaded he went his white robe flying through the dark halls of the monastery where the air was heavy with incense and sweet with prayers where the golden Amida rested upon her lotus ineffably smiling. He leaped the grey stone steps that led down from her shrine and gained the pine trees and the mountain path. Down down he fled on the rough way the nymph Kiohim pursuing. As for her her feet never touched the ground and she spread her green sleeves like wings. Down down they fled together and so close was she behind him that the monk felt her breath upon his neck.As a young goddess she is fleet of foot  he moaned.At last they came to the famed temple of Djji which was upon the plains. By this Anchin sobbed and staggered as he ran his knees failed him and his head swam.I am lost he cried for a hundred existences. But with that he saw the great temple bell of Djji that hung but a little way from the ground. He cast himself down and crept beneath it and so deemed himself sheltered and secure.Then came Kiohim the Merciless Lady and the moonlight shone upon her long sleeves. She did not sigh nor cry nor call upon her love. She stood still for a little space and smiled. Then lightly she sprang to the top of the great bronze bell of Djji and with her sharp teeth she bit through the ropes that held it so that the bell came to the ground and the monk was a prisoner. And Kiohim embraced the bell with her arms. She crept about it she crawled about it and her green robe flowed over it. Her green robe glittered with a thousand golden scales long flames burst from her lips and from her eyes a huge and fearsome Dragon she wound and coiled herself about the bell of Djji. With her Dragons tail she lashed the bell and lashed it till its bronze was red hot.Still she lashed the bell while the monk called piteously for mercy. And when he was very quiet she did not stop. All the night long the frogs sang by the Marshy Mere and the wind sighed in the sedges. But the Dragon Lady was upon the bell of Djji and she lashed it furiously with her tail till dawn.
There was once upon a time a woman who had an only daughter. When the child was about seven years old she used to pass every day on her way to school an orchard where there was a wild plum tree with delicious ripe plums hanging from the branches. Each morning the child would pick one and put it into her pocket to eat at school. For this reason she was called Prunella. Now the orchard belonged to a witch. One day the witch noticed the child gathering a plum as she passed along the road. Prunella did it quite innocently not knowing that she was doing wrong in taking the fruit that hung close to the roadside. But the witch was furious and next day hid herself behind the hedge and when Prunella came past and put out her hand to pluck the fruit she jumped out and seized her by the arm.Ah you little thief she exclaimed. I have caught you at last. Now you will have to pay for your misdeeds.The poor child half dead with fright implored the old woman to forgive her assuring her that she did not know she had done wrong and promising never to do it again. But the witch had no pity and she dragged Prunella into her house where she kept her till the time should come when she could have her revenge.As the years passed Prunella grew up into a very beautiful girl. Now her beauty and goodness instead of softening the witchs heart aroused her hatred and jealousy.One day she called Prunella to her and said Take this basket go to the well and bring it back to me filled with water. If you dont I will kill you.The girl took the basket went and let it down into the well again and again. But her work was lost labour. Each time as she drew up the basket the water streamed out of it. At last in despair she gave it up and leaning against the well she began to cry bitterly when suddenly she heard a voice at her side saying Prunella why are you cryingTurning round she beheld a handsome youth who looked kindly at her as if he were sorry for her trouble.Who are you she asked and how do you know my nameI am the son of the witch he replied and my name is Bensiabel. I know that she is determined that you shall die but I promise you that she shall not carry out her wicked plan. Will you give me a kiss if I fill your basketNo said Prunella I will not give you a kiss because you are the son of a witch.Very well replied the youth sadly. Give me your basket and I will fill it for you. And he dipped it into the well and the water stayed in it. Then the girl returned to the house carrying the basket filled with water. When the witch saw it she became white with rage and exclaimed Bensiabel must have helped you. And Prunella looked down and said nothing.Well we shall see who will win in the end said the witch in a great rage.The following day she called the girl to her and said Take this sack of wheat. I am going out for a little by the time I return I shall expect you to have made it into bread. If you have not done it I will kill you. Having said this she left the room closing and locking the door behind her.Poor Prunella did not know what to do. It was impossible for her to grind the wheat prepare the dough and bake the bread all in the short time that the witch would be away. At first she set to work bravely but when she saw how hopeless her task was she threw herself on a chair and began to weep bitterly. She was roused from her despair by hearing Bensiabels voice at her side saying Prunella Prunella do not weep like that. If you will give me a kiss I will make the bread and you will be saved.I will not kiss the son of a witch replied Prunella.But Bensiabel took the wheat from her and ground it and made the dough and when the witch returned the bread was ready baked in the oven.Turning to the girl with fury in her voice she said Bensiabel must have been here and helped you and Prunella looked down and said nothing.We shall see who will win in the end said the witch and her eyes blazed with anger.Next day she called the girl to her and said Go to my sister who lives across the mountains. She will give you a casket which you must bring back to me. This she said knowing that her sister who was a still more cruel and wicked witch than herself would never allow the girl to return but would imprison her and starve her to death. But Prunella did not suspect anything and set out quite cheerfully. On the way she met Bensiabel.Where are you going Prunella he asked.I am going to the sister of my mistress from whom I am to fetch a casket.Oh poor poor girl said Bensiabel. You are being sent straight to your death. Give me a kiss and I will save you.But again Prunella answered as before I will not kiss the son of a witch.Nevertheless I will save your life said Bensiabel for I love you better than myself. Take this flagon of oil this loaf of bread this piece of rope and this broom. When you reach the witchs house oil the hinges of the door with the contents of the flagon and throw the loaf of bread to the great fierce mastiff who will come to meet you. When you have passed the dog you will see in the courtyard a miserable woman trying in vain to let down a bucket into the well with her plaited hair. You must give her the rope. In the kitchen you will find a still more miserable woman trying to clean the hearth with her tongue to her you must give the broom. You will see the casket on the top of a cupboard take it as quickly as you can and leave the house without a moments delay. If you do all this exactly as I have told you you will not be killed.So Prunella having listened carefully to his instructions did just what he had told her. She reached the house oiled the hinges of the door threw the loaf to the dog gave the poor woman at the well the rope and the woman in the kitchen the broom caught up the casket from the top of the cupboard and fled with it out of the house. But the witch heard her as she ran away and rushing to the window called out to the woman in the kitchen Kill that thief I tell youBut the woman replied I will not kill her for she has given me a broom whereas you forced me to clean the hearth with my tongue.Then the witch called out in fury to the woman at the well Take the girl I tell you and fling her into the water and drown herBut the woman answered No I will not drown her for she gave me this rope whereas you forced me to use my hair to let down the bucket to draw water.Then the witch shouted to the dog to seize the girl and hold her fast but the dog answered No I will not seize her for she gave me a loaf of bread whereas you let me starve with hunger.The witch was so angry that she nearly choked as she called out Door bang upon her and keep her a prisoner.But the door answered I wont for she has oiled my hinges so that they move quite easily whereas you left them all rough and rusty.And so Prunella escaped and with the casket under her arm reached the house of her mistress who as you may believe was as angry as she was surprised to see the girl standing before her looking more beautiful than ever. Her eyes flashed as in furious tones she asked her Did you meet BensiabelBut Prunella looked down and said nothing.We shall see said the witch who will win in the end. Listen there are three cocks in the henhouse one is yellow one black and the third is white. If one of them crows during the night you must tell me which one it is. Woe to you if you make a mistake. I will gobble you up in one mouthful.Now Bensiabel was in the room next to the one where Prunella slept. At midnight she awoke hearing a cock crow.Which one was that shouted the witch.Then trembling Prunella knocked on the wall and whispered Bensiabel Bensiabel tell me which cock crowedWill you give me a kiss if I tell you he whispered back through the wall.But she answered No.Then he whispered back to her Nevertheless I will tell you. It was the yellow cock that crowed.The witch who had noticed the delay in Prunellas answer approached her door calling angrily Answer at once or I will kill you.So Prunella answered It was the yellow cock that crowed.And the witch stamped her foot and gnashed her teeth.Soon after another cock crowed. Tell me now which one it is called the witch. And prompted by Bensiabel Prunella answered That is the black cock.A few minutes after the crowing was heard again and the voice of the witch demanding Which one was thatAnd again Prunella implored Bensiabel to help her. But this time he hesitated for he hoped that Prunella might forget that he was a witchs son and promise to give him a kiss. And as he hesitated he heard an agonised cry from the girl Bensiabel Bensiabel save me The witch is coming she is close to me I hear the gnashing of her teethWith a bound Bensiabel opened his door and flung himself against the witch. He pulled her back with such force that she stumbled and falling headlong dropped down dead at the foot of the stairs.Then at last Prunella was touched by Bensiabels goodness and kindness to her and she became his wife and they lived happily ever after.
Many many years ago a poor fisherman and his wife lived with their three sons in a village by the sea. One day the old man set his snare in the water not far from his house and at night when he went to look at it he found that he had caught a great white fish. This startled the old man very much for he had never seen a fish like this before and it occurred to him that it was the priest of the town.He ran to his wife as fast as he could and criedMy wife I have caught the priest.What said the old woman terrified at the sight of her frightened husband.I have caught the priest said the old man again.They hurried together to the river where the snare was set and when the old woman saw the fish she criedOh it is not the priest but the governor.No it is the priest insisted the old man and they went home trembling with fear.That night neither of them was able to sleep for thought of the terrible thing that had happened and wondering what they should do. Now the next day was a great holiday in the town. At four oclock in the morning cannons were fired and bells rang loudly. The old man and woman hearing all the noise and not knowing the reason for it thought that their crime had been discovered and the people were searching for them to punish them so they set out as fast as they could to hide in the woods. On and on they went stopping only to rest so as to enable them to resume their flight.The next morning they reached the woods near Pilar where there also was a great holiday and the sexton was ringing the bells to call the people to mass. As soon as the old man and woman heard the bells they thought the people there had been notified of their escape and that they too were trying to catch them. So they turned and started home again.As they reached their house the three sons came home with their one horse and tied it to the trunk of the caramay tree. Presently the bells began to ring again for it was twelve oclock at noon. Not thinking what time of day it was the old man and woman ran out of doors in terror and seeing the horse jumped on its back with the intention of riding to the next town before anyone could catch them. When they had mounted they began to whip the horse. In their haste they had forgotten to untie the rope which was around the trunk of the caramay tree. As the horse pulled at the rope fruit fell from the tree upon the old man and woman. Believing they were shot they were so frightened that they died.
Once upon a time a number of girls were assembled spinning round a deep rift or chasm in the ground. As they spun they chattered together and told stories to each other. Up came a whitebearded old man who said to them Girls as you spin and chatter be circumspect round this rift or if any of you drops her spindle into it her mother will be turned into a cow.Thus saying he departed. The girls were astonished at his words and crowded round the rift to look into it. Unfortunately one of them the most beautiful of all dropped her spindle into it. Towards evening when she went home she spied a cowher motherin front of the gate and drove her out with the other cattle to pasture. After some time the father of the girl married a widow who brought a daughter with her into the house. The second wife had a spite at the mans first daughter especially because she was more beautiful and more industrious than her own and she allowed her neither to wash herself nor to comb her hair nor to change her clothes. One day she sent her out with the cattle gave her a bag full of tow and told her If you dont spin this tow into yarn today or if you dont wind it into a ball you had better not come home at eventideI shall kill you.It was sad for the poor girl as she went after the cattle endeavouring as well as she could to keep them together. In the afternoon when the cattle lay down to chew the cud she began to look at the bag to see how to perform her task upon it but when she saw that she could not make out what to do with it she began to cry. When the cow which was her mother saw her crying she asked her why she was crying. She told her how it was and what it was. Then said the cow to her Dont be afraid I will help you. I will take all the tow into my mouth and will chew it and yarn will come up into my ear. You must take it and reel it into a ball and you will finish it in good time.As she said so it was. She began to chew the tow piece after piece yarn came up into her ear and the girl wound and reeled it and finished the task. In the evening she departed and went to her stepmother who was amazed at seeing so much work completed. The next time she gave her as much tow again. The girl spun till noon and then in the afternoon when the cattle lay down to chew the cud the cow came up to her and began to chew the tow yarn came up into her ear and the girl wound and reeled it and finished in good time. In the evening she went home and delivered to her stepmother all the tow spun and wound. She was astonished at seeing so much work completed. The third time she gave her still more tow and sent her own daughter to see who helped her. The daughter went and concealed herself apart and saw how it was and what it was that the girl completed so much work in the day she saw how the cow took the tow into her mouth how yarn came up into her ear and how the girl wound and reeled it.She went home to tell her mother. When she heard this from her daughter she urged her husband to kill the cow. He endeavoured in every way to persuade her not to kill the cow but could not overpersuade her. At last when he saw that there was no escape he promised to kill it on a certain day. When the girl heard that they were going to kill the cow she began to cry and told the cow secretly that they were going to kill her. She said to the girl Be quietdont cry If they kill me you must not eat any of my flesh but must collect the bones and bury them behind the cottage. Then if need come to you you must go to the grave and help will come to you thence. On hearing this she went away.One day they killed the cow and boiled her flesh brought it into the parlour and began to eat. The girl alone did not eat of it according to the instructions she had received but collected the bones and then without anybody seeing her took them and buried them behind the cottage where the cow her mother had ordered her so to do. The girl was named Mary but at length when they had put all the work in the cottage upon herthat is to say to sweep to fetch water to cook to wash up the platesshe had become dirty and begrimed with ashes and cinders from excessive work at the fireplace and therefore her stepmother nicknamed her Cinderella Pepelezka and this remained her name afterwards.One Sunday her stepmother got ready to go to church with her daughter but before starting took a wooden dish of millet scattered it on the ground in the cottage and said to Cinderella Here you Cinderella if you dont pick up this millet and if you dont get dinner ready by the time that I return from church dont come before my eyes or I shall put you to death. Then they went away. Poor Cinderella when she looked at all the millet cried out weeping and wailing I will cook I will sweep I will attend to everything but what poor girl can pick up all this milletWhen she had wept and spoken immediately there came into her mind what the cow had told her to go to the grave and there help would be given her in trouble. Cinderella went off to the grave. When there what did she see On the grave stood an open box filled with all manner of rich clothes and on the lid were two pigeons white as snow. They said to her Mary take the clothes out put them on and go to church and we will pick up the millet and get the dinner ready. She put out her hands and took the upper ones which were of pure silk and satin put them on and went to church. In the church people great and small marvelled at her beauty and her dress especially because no one recognised her or knew who or what she was. Most of all did the emperors son marvel at her and never took his eyes off her. When service was ended she stole away and ran quickly home undressed immediately and put the clothes in the box and the box immediately vanished from sight. She went to the fireplace and what did she see there The millet picked up dinner readyin one word everything attended to Soon afterwards lo her stepmother came with her daughter from church saw everything in proper order and was astounded.Next Sunday when she was about to go to church taking a larger dish of millet and scattering it on the ground she threatened Cinderella that she would kill her if she didnt pick it up and get dinner ready. The stepmother went off with her daughter to church and Cinderella betook herself to the grave of the cow. On the grave she found the two pigeons and the box with the dresses in it open. They told her to dress herself and go to church and they would pick up the millet and get dinner ready. Taking a dress of pure silver she dressed herself and went off to church. Now everybody small and great marveled at her more than before and the emperors son did not take his eyes off her for a moment. Service ended she stole off amidst the multitude and got away home. There she undressed and put the clothes in the box and the box disappeared from sight. Soon afterwards lo her stepmother came and looked about the millet was picked up dinner was ready and Cinderella was at the fireplace. She was astonished at seeing so much work completed.The third time her stepmother got ready to go to church and before she started taking a dish of millet thrice as large and scattering it on the ground she said to Cinderella Cinderella if you dont pick up all this millet before we return from church and if you dont get dinner ready go and hide yourself dont come before my eyesI shall kill you.Then she went off to church. After this Cinderella went to the grave of the cow and found there the box open and the two pigeons upon it. They told her to dress herself and go to church they would pick up the millet and get the dinner ready. Taking a dress of pure gold she dressed herself and went to church. There when the people saw her they marvelled but no one knew who or what she was. The emperors son never took his eyes off her and planned when service was over to follow her closely to see whither she betook herself. Service ended she stole off amidst the crowd hastening to get away before her stepmother but as she was pushing through the crowd she lost one of her shoes and the emperors son took it up. She escaped from among them with one shoe undressed very quickly put the clothes in the box and the box vanished. She went home and looked in the cottage the millet was picked up dinner was ready and everything attended to. She sat down at the fireplace and lo her stepmother came and looked about the cottage everything was in order the millet picked up dinner ready she had nothing to find fault with her or scold her about.The emperors son left the people disguised himself took the shoe and went from cottage to cottage to try it on to find out whose it was and wherever he went he made inquiries and tried it on the foot of every girl but it did not fit one. For some it was too large and for others too small for some too narrow for others too broad. At last he came to Cinderellas cottage. As soon as her stepmother saw him she concealed Cinderella under a trough. He asked whether there was any girl in the house. She replied that there was and brought her daughter to him. He tried the shoe on her but it wouldnt even allow her toes to go in. He then asked whether there wasnt another girl there and she told him that there wasnt. The cock had flown on to the trough and when she told the emperors son that there was no other girl there he crowed Cockadoodledoo pretty girl under trough The stepmother shrieked out Shoo eagles have brought youBut the emperors son on hearing the cock say this went up and took the trough off and there was indeed the girl that he had seen in the church with those beautiful dresses only on one foot she had no shoe. He tried the shoe on her it went on and was exactly the same as that on the other foot. Then the emperors son took her by the hand conducted her to his court married her and punished her stepmother for her evil heart.Note You can read illustrated versions of other Cinderella stories from around the world in our collection Cinderella Tales International Cinderella Stories and Fairy Tales now available on Amazon in Kindle and paperback

And soon as he left home something happened. Standing on his right shoulder was a blue rat and standing on his left shoulder was a blue rat. The only way he knew they were there was by looking at them.There they were close to his ears. He could feel the far edge of their whiskers against his ears.This never happened to me before all the time I been picking rags he said. Two blue rats stand by my ears and never say anything 92even if they know I am listening to anything they tell me.So Rags Habakuk walked on two blocks three blocks four blocks squinting with his right eye slanting at the blue rat on his right shoulder and squinting with his left eye slanting at the blue rat on his left shoulder.If I stood on somebodys shoulder with my whiskers right up in somebodys ear I would say something for somebody to listen to he muttered.Of course he did not understand it was the gold buckskin whincher and the power working. Down in the pocket of the vest he had on the gold buckskin whincher power was saying Because you have two Ks in your name you must have two blue rats on your shoulders one blue rat for your right ear one blue rat for your left ear.It was good business. Never before did Rags Habakuk get so much old rags.Come againyou and your lucky blue rats people said to him. They dug into their cellars and garrets and brought him bottles and bones and copper and brass and old shoes and old clothes coats pants vests.Every morning when he went up the street with the two blue rats on his shoulders blinking their eyes straight ahead and chewing their whiskers so they sometimes tickled the ears of old Rags Habakuk sometimes women came running out on the front porch to look at him and say Well if he isnt a queer old mysterious ragman and if those aint queer old mysterious blue ratsAll the time the gold buckskin whincher and the power was working. It was saying So long as old Rags Habakuk keeps the two blue rats he shall have good luckbut if he ever sells one of the blue rats then one of his daughters shall marry a taxicab driverand if he ever sells the other blue rat then his other daughter shall marry a movingpicture hero actor.Then terrible things happened. A circus man came. I give you one thousand dollars spot cash money for one of the blue rats he expostulated with his mouth. And I give you two thousand dollars spot cash money for the two of the blue rats both of them together.Show me how much spot cash money two thousand dollars is all counted out in one pile for one man to carry away home in his gunnysack rag bag was the answer of Rags Habakuk.The circus man went to the bank and came back with spot cash greenbacks money.This spot cash greenbacks money is made from the finest silk rags printed by the national government for the national republic to make business rich and prosperous said the circus man expostulating with his mouth.The finest silk rags he expostulated again holding two fingers under the nose of Rags Habakuk.I take it said Rags Habakuk I take it. It is a whole gunnysack bag full of spot cash greenbacks money. I tell my wife it is printed by the national government for the national republic to make business rich and prosperous.Then he kissed the blue rats one on the right ear the other on the left ear and handed them over to the circus man.And that was why the next month his eighteen year old daughter married a taxicab driver who was so polite all the time to his customers that he never had time to be polite to his wife.And that was why his nineteen year old daughter married a movingpicture hero actor who worked so hard being nice and kind in the moving pictures that he never had enough left over for his wife when he got home after the days work.And the lucky vest with the gold buckskin whincher was stolen from Rags Habakuk by the taxicab driver.
Once upon a time there was a woman and she baked five pies. And when they came out of the oven they were that overbaked the crusts were too hard to eat. So she says to her daughterDarter says she put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em there a little and theyll come again.She meant you know the crust would get soft.But the girl she says to herself Well if theyll come again Ill eat em now. And she set to work and ate em all first and last.Well come suppertime the woman said Go you and get one o them there pies. I dare say theyve come again now.The girl went and she looked and there was nothing but the dishes. So back she came and says she Noo they aint come again.Not one of em says the mother.Not one of em says she.Well come again or not come again said the woman Ill have one for supper.But you cant if they aint come said the girl.But I can says she. Go you and bring the best of em.Best or worst says the girl Ive ate em all and you cant have one till thats come again.Well the woman she was done and she took her spinning to the door to spin and as she span she sangMy darter ha ate five five pies today.My darter ha ate five five pies today.The king was coming down the street and he heard her sing but what she sang he couldnt hear so he stopped and saidWhat was that you were singing my good womanThe woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing so she sang instead of thatMy darter ha spun five five skeins today.My darter ha spun five five skeins today.Stars o mine said the king I never heard tell of any one that could do that.Then he said Look you here I want a wife and Ill marry your daughter. But look you here says he eleven months out of the year she shall have all she likes to eat and all the gowns she likes to get and all the company she likes to keep but the last month of the year shell have to spin five skeins every day and if she dont I shall kill her.All right says the woman for she thought what a grand marriage that was. And as for the five skeins when the time came thered be plenty of ways of getting out of it and likeliest hed have forgotten all about it.Well so they were married. And for eleven months the girl had all she liked to eat and all the gowns she liked to get and all the company she liked to keep.But when the time was getting over she began to think about the skeins and to wonder if he had em in mind. But not one word did he say about em and she thought hed wholly forgotten em.However the last day of the last month he takes her to a room shed never set eyes on before. There was nothing in it but a spinningwheel and a stool. And says he Now my dear here youll be shut in to morrow with some victuals and some flax and if you havent spun five skeins by the night your headll go off.And away he went about his business.Well she was that frightened shed always been such a gatless girl that she didnt so much as know how to spin and what was she to do tomorrow with no one to come nigh her to help her She sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cryHowever all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the door. She upped and oped it and what should she see but a small little black thing with a long tail. That looked up at her right curious and that saidWhat are you acrying forWhats that to you says she.Never you mind that said but tell me what youre acrying for.That wont do me no good if I do says she.You dont know that that said and twirled thats tail round.Well says she that wont do no harm if that dont do no good and she upped and told about the pies and the skeins and everything.This is what Ill do says the little black thing Ill come to your window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at night.Whats your pay says she.That looked out of the corner of thats eyes and that said Ill give you three guesses every night to guess my name and if you havent guessed it before the months up you shall be mine.Well she thought shed be sure to guess thats name before the month was up. All right says she I agree.All right that says and law how that twirled thats tail.Well the next day her husband took her into the room and there was the flax and the days food.Now theres the flax says he and if that aint spun up this night off goes your head. And then he went out and locked the door.Hed hardly gone when there was a knocking against the window.She upped and she oped it and there sure enough was the little old thing sitting on the ledge.Wheres the flax says he.Here it be says she. And she gave it to him.Well come the evening a knocking came again to the window. She upped and she oped it and there was the little old thing with five skeins of flax on his arm.Here it be says he and he gave it to her.Now whats my name says he.What is that Bill says she.Noo that aint says he and he twirled his tail.Is that Ned says she.Noo that aint says he and he twirled his tail.Well is that Mark says she.Noo that aint says he and he twirled his tail harder and away he flew.Well when her husband came in there were the five skeins ready for him. I see I shant have to kill you tonight my dear says he youll have your food and your flax in the morning says he and away he goes.Well every day the flax and the food were brought and every day that there little black impet used to come mornings and evenings. And all the day the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it came at night. But she never hit on the right one. And as it got towards the end of the month the impet began to look so maliceful and that twirled thats tail faster and faster each time she gave a guess.At last it came to the last day but one. The impet came at night along with the five skeins and that saidWhat aint you got my name yetIs that Nicodemus says she.Noo taint that says.Is that Sammle says she.Noo taint that says.Awell is that Methusalem says she.Noo taint that neither that says.Then that looks at her with thats eyes like a coal o fire and that says Woman theres only tomorrow night and then youll be mine And away it flew.Well she felt that horrid. However she heard the king coming along the passage. In he came and when he sees the five skeins he says says heWell my dear says he I dont see but what youll have your skeins ready tomorrow night as well and as I reckon I shant have to kill you Ill have supper in here tonight. So they brought supper and another stool for him and down the two sat.Well he hadnt eaten but a mouthful or so when he stops and begins to laugh.What is it says she.Awhy says he I was out ahunting today and I got away to a place in the wood Id never seen before And there was an old chalk pit. And I heard a kind of a sort of a humming. So I got off my hobby and I went right quiet to the pit and I looked down. Well what should there be but the funniest little black thing you ever set eyes on. And what was that doing but that had a little spinningwheel and that was spinning wonderful fast and twirling thats tail. And as that span that sangNimmy nimmy notMy names Tom Tit Tot.Well when the girl heard this she felt as if she could have jumped out of her skin for joy but she didnt say a word.Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for the flax. And when night came she heard that knocking against the window panes. She oped the window and that come right in on the ledge. That was grinning from ear to ear and Oo thats tail was twirling round so fast.Whats my name that says as that gave her the skeins.Is that Solomon she says pretending to be afeard.Noo taint that says and that came further into the room.Well is that Zebedee says she again.Noo taint says the impet. And then that laughed and twirled thats tail till you couldnt hardly see it.Take time woman that says next guess and youre mine. And that stretched out thats black hands at her.Well she backed a step or two and she looked at it and then she laughed out and says she pointing her finger at itNIMMY NIMMY NOT YOUR NAMES TOM TIT TOTWell when that heard her that gave an awful shriek and away that flew into the dark and she never saw it any more.
The next morning John OBrien was sitting alone when there was a knock at the door. Then Peter Sullivan opened it said God save all here and came in.God save you kindly John answered.Its distressed we are said Peter to hear of the death of poor Kitty. Ellen would be here with me to tell you so only bein in bed herself and not able to stir and whatll come to all of us I dunno. Im that disturbed about her I dunno what Ill do at all. I left her with one of the neighbors and came to see your mother about her. But sure its you has the great grief on you already whatever comes to us. Its not only you Im thinkin of but its the child left with no mother. Oh its a terrible thing.My own mother can bring up any child John answered. Have no fear of that. Its us that knew Kitty thatll feel the loss of her.And how is the child doing anyway Peter asked.She looks fine and healthy glory be to God said John.Its a girl they tell me.Do you know yet what youll call herWell name her Kathleen after her mother said John.Then youll be calling her Kitty like her mother I suppose.Nono John answered slowly I dont think Ill call her that. The child will be always Kathleen. I dunno if I can tell you how I feel about that. It was a name for a child more than a womanKittyand yet now that shes gone from me Ive a feeling like it was something more than the name of a womanlike it was something holy like the name of the blessed Mother of God. When I think of that name now I want to think only of her and I wouldnt like to be calling even her own child by it. Its Kathleen Ill call hernothing else.Youre right about all that no doubt said Peter but I cant be staying here and Ellen and the child at home the way they are. You have your child left and you say its healthythank God for that samebut it looks like I might have neither wife nor child.Dont say that man alive said John whats the matter at all thenI cant stop discoursin here Peter answered. I came to ask would your mother being a knowledgable woman step over for a bit and see can she tell at all whats the matter with Ellen and the child. There was a doctor there but he seemed to do no good and Ellen said your mother would know more than all the doctors so I came to ask would she come. And if you care to come yourself Ill be telling you how they are as we go along but I cant stay here its too long to be away from them.Mother is with the child said John Ill speak to her.He went into another room where the baby was sleeping and his mother was sitting beside her. He told her why Peter had come. Step downstairs said Mrs. OBrien and ask Mrs. Mulvey will she sit by the baby till Im back. Then Ill go with him. And youd better come too John the air will do you good.John went down to another of the tenements in the house and came back with their neighbor Mrs. Mulvey. If youll be so kind Mrs. OBrien said sit here by the baby till Im back and Ill not be long. And mind you keep everything as it is unless she wakes and then youll know what to do as well as I for youve children of your own. But dont disturb the pair of scissors thats there beside her and dont take off the horseshoe nail thats hung round her neck.And whats them things for Mrs. Mulvey asked with wonder in her eyes.Why to keep the Good People from stealing the child Mrs. OBrien answered. Did you never hear of those things Dont you know the Good People cant stand the touch of iron or even to be near it And especially a horseshoe nail they cant stand. And the scissors too they couldnt come near and then leaving them open they make a cross and that keeps the child all the more from the Good People.John and his mother left Mrs. Mulvey with little Kathleen and went with Peter. And whats wrong with Ellen then Mrs. OBrien asked.I dunno that theres so much wrong with herself as you might say Peter answered. I think its more than anything else that shes worried about the child.And whats wrong with the child thenTheres everything wrong with the child said Peter. Its not like the same child at all. Last night he was as healthy a boy as yould wish to seequiet and peaceable and goodtempered and stronglooking for his age. And now this morning hes thin and sicklooking and theres black hair all over his arms and his face is wrinkled like he was a little old man and he does nothing but cry and scream till you cant bear it and twist and squirm till you cant hold him. Its like he was fairystruck only I dont believe in them things at all.Did you watch him close last night Mrs. OBrien asked.Part of the time Peter answered but I dare say we was both asleep other times.Was Ellen careful about her prayers last night and were you so tooI cant say about that Peter said. We might be letting some of them go such a time as that you know and make it up after.Yes said Mrs. OBrien make it up after by losing your child Was there any iron anywhere about himI dont know that there was.And did you make a circle of fire about the place where he was lyingI did not.The childs not been struck said Mrs. OBrien not the way you mean. Its not your child at all but one of the Good People themselves thats in it. Theyve stolen your child and left a changeling in the place of it.Its the same way you always talked Mrs. OBrien said Peter. I dont believe them things.They had come to Peters door by this time. They found Ellen lying in bed looking frightened half to death and beside her was the baby or the fairy or whatever it was. It was not crying loudly now but it was keeping up a little whining and whimpering noise that was quite as unpleasant to listen to as a good honest cry. Its face looked thin and pinched and old it had a little thin wispy hair on its head where no baby of the age that this one was supposed to be has a right to have any. Its arms and hands were thin and bony. It looked weak and sick but it was rolling and wriggling about in the liveliest way. It would give a spring as if it were going straight off the bed upon the floor and when poor Ellen caught at it to save it it would roll back toward her stop its crying for a second and seem to be laughing at her and then it would do the same thing again.Its plain enough Mrs. OBrien said as soon as she saw it. Its one of the Good People. But its quick enough well be rid of it and have back your own child. Bring me some eggs.Ill have nothing of the sort now said Ellen. Its bad the poor child is with some sickness or other but its my own child and Ill have nothing done to it thats not to do it good. If you know anything thatll help it Mrs. OBrien tell me that but dont be sayin its not my child.Ill not hurt the child whatever it is said Mrs. OBrien but there are ways to tell whether its your own child at all or one of the Good People. If you find its one of them then its easy to do more but in the meantime its not harmed.Ill not have you trying any of them things said Ellen. Ill not have you saying its not my child and Ill not be thinking of such a thing myself. You see how poor and sick its looking. If theres anything you can do for the child do it but dont be talking that way any more.Ellen said Mrs. OBrien you dont know what youre talking about at all. Wait now till I tell you what was told to me when I lived in Dublin and I think that it was not far from there that it happened. Its about a woman that talked as you do. A sailors wife she was and there was a child born to her while her husband was away at sea. She thought held be home soon and so she wanted to put off the christening of the child till held be back. So she waited and waited for a long time and her husband did not come. The neighbors told her she was doing wrong to wait so long and she ought to have the child christened before anything would happen to it. But she wouldnt listen to them.So it went on for a year and a half and still the father didnt come home. But the boy was healthy and happy and the mother never had any trouble with him. But the trouble came. One day shed been working in the field and she came home and as soon as she was in the house she heard crying from the bed where the child used to sleep. She ran to look at him and he lay there looking sick and thin and weak the way your boy does and crying that he was hungry. He was like her child and he was not like him. Hed grown so pale and badlooking that she thought hed had a stroke from the Good People. But she went to get him some bread and milk and she asked her other boy that was about seven years old when it was and how it was that he began to be sick.I left him playing near the fire the boy said and I was in the other room. And I heard a rushing noise like a great flock of birds flying down the chimney and then I heard a cry from my brother and then again the noise like the birds were flying out at the chimney again. And then I ran in and found him there the way you see him now.Well if the poor woman had never had trouble with the child before she had nothing but trouble now. Crying and squalling it was all the time and it nearly ate her out of house and home and yet it seemed always sick and weak and thin. The neighbors came and they told her it was not her child at all but one of the Good People that had been put in the place of it and it was all her own fault for not having it christened in the right time. But not a word of it all would she listen to and she said all the time that whatever was wrong with it it was her own child and sheld hear nothing to the contrary.It was an outoftheway place where they lived and there was no priest near or she never could have kept it from being christened as long as she did. But at last the neighbors themselves said that if she didnt see to it they would. And they said to her Its not your child at all thats in it and if youll have it christened youll see. And if you wont take the child to the priest with us now well go to him ourselves and tell him all about it. Its not right to keep it from him longer.So with that she thought it was no use and sheld have to do as they said and she took the child and tried to dress him ready to take him to the priest to be christened. But the roars and the screams that he let out of him were more than anybody could bear and at the last she said Oh I cant do it its too terrible a thing for him he wont bear it and how can I make himThe next day when she came in from her work the other boy said to her Mother it was uncommon quiet he was while you was away today. And by and by I went in to see what was ailing him. And there he sat looking so like an old man that I was near afraid of him. And he looked at me and he spoke as plain as an old man and he says Pat says he bring me a pipe till I have a bit of a smoke. Its tired of life I am lying here without it.Ah says I wait till my mother gets home and Ill tell her of this.Tell her says he and shell not believe a word from you.And no more do I believe a word from you says the woman.Well soon after that there came a letter from the father saying that held be at home now in a few days. With that the woman set off to town to buy things to eat and drink to welcome her husband home and she said Now well have the christening as soon as ever he comes.Then as soon as she was off the neighbors said Now is the time that well be done with that imp. Well take him and have him christened while shes away and well not give her the chance to put it off again because he cries.So they went to the house and one of the women came up to the bed and clapped a quilt over him and had him wrapped up in it before he knew what was happening to him and away they all went down toward the brook on the way to the priest. Well he kicked and he struggled to get free but the woman held him so tight it was no use. But when they came to the running water it was then he began bellowing like a herd of bulls and kicking and pulling so that it was all she could do to hold him.She got her foot on the first of the steppingstones and it was then he began to get heavy as if it was a stone that she was carrying. But she held hard and reached the second stone and it seemed to her that he was nothing but a lump of lead only still roaring and struggling and what with that and the rushing of the water below her she began to get dizzy but still she held on and she had her foot on the stone in the middle of the stream when plump down he fell through the quilt that he was wrapped in as if it had been nothing but a muslin handkerchief.And there he went floating down the stream and shouting and laughing at them. For you know its not being in running water that can hurt one of the Good People but only crossing it and if they tried to cross it theyld be in awful pain till they got to the middle and then nothing could keep them from falling in.So they were rid of him and you know when youre rid of a changeling the Good People must send your own child back. And so the neighbors had not got back to the house when they met the mother running to meet them and bringing her own child that she had found in its bed when she got back from the town sleeping as well and as sound as ever it was.And now Ellen said Mrs. OBrien will you let me try in ways that I know that can do no harm whether this is your own child or not And if its not youll have your own back as well as it was last night.This is my own child Ellen answered and its not by any silly tales like that that you can make me believe it isnt. Ill not have you doing anything of the sort. If you know anything that can help a baby when its sick you may do that but nothing else.I do know one thing that can help a sick baby Mrs. OBrien answered and that Ill do if you like it or not. If that thing there is one of the Good People as I think its not sick and it will live for thousands of years after we are dead. We can neither help it nor much hurt it. But if that is your child it doesnt look to me as if it would live an hour. Ill not try whether its yours or not but if its yours Ill not stand by and see its soul die that ought to be the soul of a Christian. Ellen Sullivan that child will be christened before I leave this house.Christened poor Ellen cried in amazement. And whos to christen him We couldnt get a priest here in an hourmaybe not today.Theres no need of a priest Mrs. OBrien said Ill christen him myself. Bring me some water there Peter.But sure you cant do that Peter protested. Nobody but a priest could christen a child.I can christen the child as well as a priest said Mrs. OBrien you take a child to the priest to be christened when its easy and convenient but when theres no priest near and the child is sick and seems likely to die before one can come anybody can christen it and that christening stands and it never has to be christened after. Thats the law of the Church. Bring me the water. I never saw a child that seemed more likely to die than this one if its a child at all.And Peter brought the water.What do you call the child Mrs. OBrien asked.I think well call him Terence Peter answered. That was my grandfathers name on my mothers side and a decent man he was and uncommon fond of myself when I was a bit of a gossoon till he died Heaven rest his soul and I think Id like to name the boy after him.Now all that the child had been doing and all the noise that he had been making before were simply nothing to what he had been doing ever since Mrs. OBrien first said the word christen. He was screaming so that all this talk could scarcely be heard and it was almost more than Mrs. OBrien could do to hold him when she took him in her arms. But she did hold him for a moment with one arm while she dipped up some water with her hand and sprinkled it over him. Then the creature gave one great jump and was away from her and fell on the floor.Before anybody else could move Mrs. OBrien herself picked him up and laid him on the bed. There was no sign that he was hurt. No child that was hurt could have screamed as he did. Come John said Mrs. OBrien weve done all that we can.May I walk back with you a piece said Peter. There was something more that I was thinking I would say.Come back with us of course and welcome said John.They left the house and walked along the street.I think it was right what you done Mrs. OBrien said Peter. I cant think about the child the way you think but it was right what you done.Mrs. OBrien made no answer. John said Peter theres something that I was thinking of last night and this morning and it was this You have a girl and I have a boy that was both born on the one day. Its good friends weve always been and your father and your mother and my father and my mother before us. And I was just thinking when your girl and my boy grows up supposing that they like each other well enough it might be pleasant to all of us that theyld be married some time.Theres no mans son that Id rather see a daughter of mine married to than yours Peter said John if she herself was pleased. Ild not ask her to take anybody she didnt like but if she came to love him and he came to love her Ild be as pleased as yourself.It was that I wanted to say said Peter and Id better go back to Ellen now.John and his mother said no more till they were at home. They both went into the room where little Kathleen was. Mrs. Mulvey sat watching the baby. She went out and left them. The child was sleeping as peacefully as if there were no such thing in the world as sorrow or loss or doubt or a fairy to help or harm.John said Mrs. OBrien Id think I might have done harm to that child in trying to christen it only Im as sure as ever I was of anything that its not a child at all but one of the Good People so I think theres no harm done. I dont know what would happen any of the Good People if he was to be rightly christened. I think held not be able to stand it and would be driven out so that theyld have to send back the real child. Now if a priest ever sees that creature that weve just seen and asks Has this child been christened theyll have to answer Yes and he cannot be christened again. And yet with the jump that he gave out of my arms when I sprinkled the water its not sure I am that a drop of it touched him.
A girl once lived in the province of Echigo who from her earliest years tended her parents with all filial piety. Her mother when after a long illness she lay at the point of death took out a mirror that she had for many years concealed and giving it to her daughter spoke thus when I have ceased to exist take this mirror in thy hand night and morning and looking at it fancy that tis I thou seest.With these last words she expired and the girl full of grief and faithful to her mothers commands used to take out the mirror night and morning and gazing in it saw there in a face like to the face of her mother. Delighted thereat for the village was situated in a remote country district among the mountains and a mirror was a thing the girl had never heard of she daily worshipped her reflected face. She bowed before it till her forehead touched the mat as if this image had been in very truth her mothers own self.Her father one day astonished to see her thus occupied inquired the reason which she directly told him. But he burst out laughing and exclaimed Why tis only thine own face so like to thy mothers that is reflected. It is not thy mothers at allThis revelation distressed the girl. Yet she replied Even if the face be not my mothers it is the face of one who belonged to my mother and therefore my respectfully saluting it twice every day is the same as respectfully saluting her very self. And so she continued to worship the mirror more and more while tending her father with all filial pietyat least so the story goes for even today as great poverty and ignorance prevail in some parts of Echigo the peasantry know as little of mirrors as did this little girl.
In the Skalunda mountain near the church there once lived a giant in the early days who no longer felt comfortable after the church had been built there. At length he decided that he could no longer stand the ringing of the church bells so he emigrated and settled down on an island far out in the North Sea. Once upon a time a ship was wrecked on this island and among those saved were several people from Skalunda.Whence do you hail asked the giant who by now had grown old and blind and sat warming himself before a log fire.We are from Skalunda if you wish to know said one of the men saved.Give me your hand so that I may feel whether there is still warm blood to be found in the Swedish land said the giant.The man who feared to shake hands with the giant drew a redhot bar of iron from the fire and handed it to him. He seized it firmly and pressed it so hard that the molten iron ran down between his fingers.Yes there is still warm blood to be found in Sweden said he. And tell me he continued is Skalunda mountain still standingNo the hens have scratched it away the man answered.How could it last said the giant. My wife and daughter piled it up in the course of a single Sunday morning. But surely the Hallenberg and the Hunneberg are still standing for those I built myself.When the man had confirmed this the giant wanted to know whether Karin was still living in Stommen. And when they told him that she was he gave them a girdle and with it the message that Karin was to wear it in remembrance of him.The men took the girdle and gave it to Karin upon their return home but before Karin put it on she clasped it around the oaktree that grew in the court. No sooner had she done so than the oak tore itself out of the ground and flew to the North borne away by the stormwind. In the place where it had stood was a deep pit and the roots of the tree were so enormous that one of the best springs in Stommen flows from one of the rootholes to this very day.
It was rather late when we left War Eagles lodge after having learned why the Indians never kill the Micepeople and the milky way was white and plain dimming the stars with its mist. The children all stopped to say good night to little Seesinthedark a brandnew baby sister of Bluebirds then they all went to bed.The next day the boys played at war just as white boys do and the girls played with dolls dressed in buckskin clothes until it grew tiresome when they visited relatives until it came time for us all to go to their grandfathers lodge. He was smoking when we entered but soon laid aside the pipe and saidYou know that the otter skin is big medicine no doubt. You have noticed that our warriors wear it sometimes and you know that we all think it very lucky to wear the skin of the Otter. But you dont know how it came to be great so I shall tell you.One time long before my grandfather was born a youngman of our tribe was unlucky in everything. No woman wanted to marry him because he couldnt kill enough meat to keep her in food and clothes. Whenever he went hunting his bow always broke or he would lose his lance. If these things didnt happen his horse would fall and hurt him. Everybody talked about him and his bad luck and although he was finelooking he had no close friends because of his ill fortune. He tried to dream and get his medicine but no dream would come. He grew sour and people were sorry for him all the time. Finally his name was changed to The Unluckyone which sounds bad to the ear. He used to wander about alone a good deal and one morning he saw an old woman gathering wood by the side of a River. The Unluckyone was about to pass the old woman when she stopped him and askedWhy are you so sad in your handsome face Why is that sorry look in your fine eyesBecause replied the youngman I am the Unluckyone. Everything goes wrong with me always. I dont want to live any longer for my heart is growing wicked.Come with me said the old woman and he followed her until she told him to sit down. Then she said Listen to me. First you must learn a song to sing and this is it. Then she sang a queer song over and over again until the youngman had learned it well.Now do what I tell you and your heart shall be glad some day. She drew from her robe a pair of moccasins and a small sack of dried meat. Here she said put these moccasins on your feet and take this sack of meat for food for you must travel far. Go on down this river until you come to a great beaver village. Their lodges will be large and finelooking and you will know the village by the great size of the lodges. When you get to the place you must stand still for a long time and then sing the song I taught you. When you have finished the singing a great white Beaver chief of all the Beavers in the world will come to you. He is wise and can tell you what to do to change your luck. After that I cannot help you but do what the white Beaver tells you without asking why. Now go and be braveThe youngman started at once. Long his steps were for he was young and strong. Far he travelled down the riversaw many beaver villages too but he did not stop because the lodges were not big as the old woman told him they would be in the right village. His feet grew tired for he travelled day and night without resting but his heart was brave and he believed what the old woman had told him.It was late on the third day when he came to a mighty beaver village and here the lodges were greater than any he had ever seen before. In the centre of the camp was a monstrous lodge built of great sticks and towering above the rest. All about the ground was neat and clean and bare as your hand. The Unluckyone knew this was the white Beavers lodgeknew that at last he had found the chief of all the Beavers in the world so he stood still for a long time and then sang that song.Soon a great white Beaverwhite as the snows of wintercame to him and asked Why do you sing that song my brother What do you want of me I have never heard a man sing that song before. You must be in trouble.I am the Unluckyone the youngman replied. I can do nothing well. I can find no woman who will marry me. In the hunt my bow will often break or my lance is poor. My medicine is bad and I cannot dream. The people do not love me and they pity me as they do a sick child.I am sorry for you said the white Beaverchief of all the Beavers in the worldbut you must find my brother the Coyote who knows where OLDmans lodge is. The Coyote will do your bidding if you sing that song when you see him. Take this stick with you because you will have a long journey and with the stick you may cross any river and not drown if you keep it always in your hand. That is all I can do for you myself.On down the river the Unluckyone travelled and the sun was low in the west on the fourth day when he saw the Coyote on a hillside near by. After looking at Coyote for a long time the youngman commenced to sing the song the old woman had taught him. When he had finished the singing the Coyote came up close and askedWhat is the matter Why do you sing that song I never heard a man sing it before. What is it you want of meThen the Unluckyone told the Coyote what he had told the white Beaver and showed the stick the Beaverchief had given him to prove it.I am hungry too said the Unluckyone for I have eaten all the dried meat the old woman gave me.Wait here said the Coyote my brother the Wolf has just killed a fat Doe and perhaps he will give me a little of the meat when I tell him about you and your troubles.Away went the Coyote to beg for meat and while he was gone the youngman bathed his tired feet in a cool creek. Soon the Coyote came back with meat and youngman built a fire and ate some of it even before it was warm for he was starving. When he had finished the Coyote saidNow I shall take you to OLDmans lodge come.They started even though it was getting dark. Long they travelled without stoppingover plains and mountainsthrough great forests and across rivers until they came to a cave in the rough rocks on the side of a mighty mountain.In there said the Coyote you will find OLDman and he can tell you what you want to know.The Unluckyone stood before the black hole in the rocks for a long time because he was afraid but when he turned to speak to the Coyote he found himself to be alone. The Coyote had gone about his own businesshad silently slipped away in the night.Slowly and carefully the youngman began to creep into the cave feeling his way in the darkness. His heart was beating like a tomtom at a dance. Finally he saw a fire away back in the cave.The shadows danced about the stone sides of the cave as men say the ghosts do and they frightened him. But looking he saw a man sitting on the far side of the fire. The mans hair was like the snow and very long. His face was wrinkled with the seams left by many years of life and he was naked in the firelight that played about him.Slowly the youngman stood upon his feet and began to walk toward the fire with great fear in his heart. When he had reached the place where the firelight fell upon him the OLDman looked up and saidHow youngman I am OLDman. Why did you come here What is it you wantThen the Unluckyone told OLDman just what he had told the old woman and the white Beaver and the Coyote and showed the stick the Beaver had given him to prove it.Smoke said OLDman and passed the pipe to his visitor. After they had smoked OLDman saidI will tell you what to do. On the top of this great mountain there live many ghostpeople and their chief is a great Owl. This Owl is the only one who knows how you can change your luck and he will tell you if you are not afraid. Take this arrow and go among those people without fear. Show them you are unarmed as soon as they see you. Now goOut into the night went the Unluckyone and on up the mountain. The way was rough and the wind blew from the north chilling his limbs and stinging his face but on he went toward the mountaintop where the stormclouds sleep and the winter always stays. Drifts of snow were piled all about and the wind gathered it up and hurled it at the young man as though it were angry at him. The clouds waked and gathered around him making the night darker and the world lonelier than before but on the very top of the mountain he stopped and tried to look through the clouds. Then he heard strange singing all about him but for a long time there was no singer in sight. Finally the clouds parted and he saw a great circle of ghostpeople with large and ugly heads. They were seated on the icy ground and on the drifts of snow and on the rocks singing a warlike song that made the heart of the youngman stand still in dread. In the centre of the circle there sat a mighty Owltheir chief. Howhen the ghostpeople saw the Unluckyone they rushed at him with many lances and would have killed him but the Owlchief cried StopThe youngman folded his arms and said I am unarmedcome and see how a Blackfoot dies. I am not afraid of you.Ho said the Owlchief we kill no unarmed man. Sit down my son and tell me what you want. Why do you come here You must be in trouble. You must smoke with me.The Unluckyone told the Owlchief just what he had told the old woman and the Beaver and the Coyote and OLDman and showed the stick that the white Beaver had given him and the arrow that OLDman had given to him to prove it.Good said the Owlchief I can help you but first you must help yourself. Take this bow. It is a medicinebow then you will have a bow that will not break and an arrow that is good and straight. Now go down this mountain until you come to a river. It will be dark when you reach this river but you will know the way. There will be a great cottonwoodtree on the bank of the stream where you first come to the water. At this tree you must turn down the stream and keep on travelling without rest until you hear a splashing in the water near you. When you hear the splashing you must shoot this arrow at the sound. Shoot quickly for if you do not you can never have any good luck. If you do as I have told you the splasher will be killed and you must then take his hide and wear it always. The skin that the splasher wears will make you a lucky man. It will make anybody lucky and you may tell your people that it is so.Now go for it is nearly day and we must sleep.The youngman took his bow and arrow and the stick the white Beaver had given him and started on his journey. All the day he travelled and far into the night. At last he came to a river and on the bank he saw the great cottonwoodtree just as the ghost Owl had told him. At the tree the youngman turned down the stream and in the dark easily found his way along the bank. Very soon he heard a great splashing in the water near him andzipphe let the arrow go at the soundthen all was still again. He stood and looked and listened but for a long time could see nothinghear nothing.Then the moon came out from under a cloud and just where her light struck the river he saw some animal floatingdead. With the magic stick the youngman walked out on the water seized the animal by the legs and drew it ashore. It was an Otter and the youngman took his hide right there.A Wolf waited in the brush for the body of the Otter and the youngman gave it to him willingly because he remembered the meat the Wolf had given the Coyote. As soon as the youngman had skinned the Otter he threw the hide over his shoulder and started for his own country with a light heart but at the first good place he made a camp and slept. That night he dreamed and all was well with him.After days of travel he found his tribe again and told what had happened. He became a great hunter and a great chief among us. He married the most beautiful woman in the tribe and was good to her always. They had many children and we remember his name as one that was great in war. That is allHo
In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always went about together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield and were returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained by selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near their village and this they reached early one morning. In it there lived three notorious robbers of whose existence the traders had never heard and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stood before them with swords and cudgels in their hands and ordered them to lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with them and so though they were many more in number they had to submit themselves to the robbers who took away everything from them even the very clothes they wore and gave to each only a small loincloth a span in breadth and a cubit in length.The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their property now took possession of the robbers minds. They seated themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered and ordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants now mourned their fate. They had lost all they had except their loin cloth and still the robbers were not satisfied but ordered them to dance.There was among the ten merchants one who was very clever. He pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends the dance they would have to perform and the magnificent manner in which the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground in the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders who were now commencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance and as a song is always sung by the leader on such occasions to which the rest keep time with hands and feet he thus began to sing We are enty menThey are erith menIf each erith man Surround eno menEno man remains.T tai tm tadingana.The robbers were all uneducated and thought that the leader was merely singing a song as usual. So it was in one sense for the leader commenced from a distance and had sung the song over twice before he and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had understood his meaning because they had been trained in trade.When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a purchaser they use a riddling sort of language.What is the price of this cloth one trader will ask another.Enty rupees another will reply meaning ten rupees.Thus there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant unless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this secret language erith means three enty means ten and eno means one. So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellowtraders that they were ten men the robbers only three that if three pounced upon each of the robbers nine of them could hold them down while the remaining one bound the robbers hands and feet.The three thieves glorying in their victory and little understanding the meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers were proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung a third time. T tai tm had left the lips of the singer and before tadingana was out of them the traders separated into parties of three and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining onethe leader himselftore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth six cubits long and tied the hands and feet of the robbers. These were entirely humbled now and rolled on the ground like three bags of riceThe ten traders now took back all their property and armed themselves with the swords and cudgels of their enemies and when they reached their village they often amused their friends and relatives by relating their adventure.
Long ago there dwelt on the shores of the Great Water in the west a young man and his younger wife. They had no children and they lived all by themselves far from other people on an island not far from the coast. The man spent his time in catching the deepsea fish far out on the ocean or in spearing salmon in the distant rivers. Often he was gone for many days and his wife was very lonely in his absence. She was not afraid for she had a stout spirit but it was very dismal in the evenings to look only at the grey leaden sky and to hear only the sound of the surf as it beat upon the beach. So day after day she said to herself I wish we had children. They would be good company for me when I am alone and my husband is far away.One evening at twilight when she was solitary because of her husbands absence on the ocean catching the deepsea fish she sat on the sand beach looking out across the water. The sky in the west was pale grey it was always dull and grey in that country and when the sun had gone down there was no soft light. In her loneliness the woman said to herself I wish we had children to keep me company.A Kingfisher with his children was diving for minnows not far away. And the woman said Oh sea bird with the white collar I wish we had children like you.And the Kingfisher said Look in the seashells look in the seashells and flew away. The next evening the woman sat again upon the beach looking westward at the dull grey sky. Not far away a white Seagull was riding on the waves in the midst of her brood of little ones.And the woman said Oh white sea bird I wish we had children like you to keep us company. And the Seagull said Look in the sea shells look in the sea shells and flew away.The woman wondered greatly at the words of the Kingfisher and the SeaGull. As she sat there in thought she heard a strange cry coming from the sand dunes behind her. She went closer to the sound and found that the cry came from a large seashell lying on the sand. She picked up the shell and inside of it was a tiny boy crying as hard as he could. She was well pleased with her discovery and she carried the baby to her home and cared for him. When her husband came home from the sea he too was very happy to find the baby there for he knew that they would be lonely no more.The baby grew very rapidly and soon he was able to walk and move about where he pleased. One day the woman was wearing a copper bracelet on her arm and the child said to her I must have a bow made from the copper on your arm. So to please him she made him a tiny bow from the bracelet and two tiny arrows. At once he set out to hunt game and day after day he came home bearing the products of his chase. He brought home geese and ducks and brant and small sea birds and gave them to his mother for food. As he grew older the man and his wife noticed that his face took on a golden hue brighter than the color of his copper bow. Wherever he went there was a strange light. When he sat on the beach looking to the west the weather was always calm and there were strange bright gleams upon the water. And his fosterparents wondered greatly at this unusual power. But the boy would not talk about it when they spoke of it he was always silent.It happened once that the winds blew hard over the Great Water and the man could not go out to catch fish because of the turbulent sea. For many days he stayed on shore for the ocean which was usually at peace was lashed into a great fury and the waves were dashing high on the beach. Soon the people were in need of fish for food. And the boy said I will go out with you for I can overcome the Storm Spirit.The man did not want to go but at last he listened to the boys requests and together they set out for the fishing grounds far across the tossing sea. They had not gone far when they met the Spirit of the Storm coming madly from the southwest where the great winds dwelt. He tried hard to upset their boat but over them he had no power for the boy guided the frail craft across the water and all around them the sea was calm and still. Then the Storm Spirit called his nephew Black Cloud to help him and away in the southeast they saw him hurrying to his uncles aid. But the boy said to the man Be not afraid for I am more than a match for him.So the two met but when Black Cloud saw the boy he quickly disappeared. Then the Spirit of the Storm called Mist of the Sea to come and cover the water for he thought the boat would be lost if he hid the land from the man and the boy. When the man saw Mist of the Sea coming like a grey vapor across the water he was very frightened for of all his enemies on the ocean he feared this one most. But the boy said He cannot harm you when I am with you. And sure enough when Mist of the Sea saw the boy sitting smiling in the boat he disappeared as quickly as he had come. And the Storm Spirit in great anger hurried away to other parts and that day there was no more danger on the sea near the fishing grounds.The boy and the man soon reached the fishing grounds in safety. And the boy taught his foster father a magic song with which he was able to lure fish to his nets. Before evening came the boat was filled with good fat fish and they set out for their home. The man said Tell me the secret of your power.But the boy said It is not yet time.The next day the boy killed many birds. He skinned them all and dried their skins. Then he dressed himself in the skin of a plover and rose into the air and flew above the sea. And the sea under him was grey like his wings. Then he came down and dressed himself in the skin of a bluejay and soared away again. And the sea over which he was flying was at once changed to blue like the blue of his wings. When he came back to the beach he put on the skin of a robin with the breast of a golden hue like his face. Then he flew high and at once the waves under him reflected a color as of fire and bright gleams of light appeared upon the ocean and the sky in the west was golden red. The boy flew back to the beach and he said to his foster parents Now it is time for me to leave you. I am the offspring of the sun. Yesterday my power was tested and it was not found wanting so now I must go away and I shall see you no more. But at evening I shall appear to you often in the twilight sky in the west. And when the sky and the sea look at evening like the color of my face you will know that there will be no wind nor storm and that on the next day the weather will be fair. But although I go away I shall leave you a strange power. And always when you need me let me know your desires by making white offerings to me so that I may see them from my home far in the west.Then he gave to his foster mother a wonderful robe. He bade his parents goodbye and soared away to the west leaving them in sadness. But the woman still keeps a part of the power he gave her and when she sits on the island in a crevice in the dunes and loosens her wonderful robe the wind hurries down from the land and the sea is ruffled with storm and the more she loosens the garment the greater is the tempest. But in the late autumn when the cold mists come in from the sea and the evenings are chill and the sky is dull and grey she remembers the promise of the boy. And she makes to him an offering of tiny white feathers plucked from the breasts of birds. She throws them into the air and they appear as flakes of snow and rise thickly into the winds. And they hurry westward to tell the boy that the world is grey and dreary as it yearns for the sight of his golden face. Then he appears to the people of earth. He comes at evening and lingers after the sun has gone until the twilight sky is red and the ocean in the west has gleams of golden light. And the people then know that there will be no wind and that on the next day the weather will be fair as he promised them long ago.
In the province of the Deiri Yorkshire not far from my birthplace says William of Newbury a wonderful thing occurred which I have known from my boyhood. There is a town a few miles distant from the Eastern Sea near which are those celebrated waters commonly called Gipse. A peasant of this town went once to see a friend who lived in the next town and it was late at night when he was coming back not very sober when lo from the adjoining barrow which I have often seen and which is not much over a quarter of a mile from the town he heard the voices of people singing and as it were joyfully feasting. He wondered who they could be that were breaking in that place by their merriment the silence of the dead night and he wished to examine into the matter more closely. Seeing a door open in the side of the barrow he went up to it and looked in and there he beheld a large and luminous house full of people women as well as men who were reclining as at a solemn banquet. One of the attendants seeing him standing at the door offered him a cup. He took it but would not drink and pouring out the contents kept the vessel. A great tumult arose at the banquet on account of his taking away the cup and all the guests pursued him but he escaped by the fleetness of the beast he rode and got into the town with his booty.Finally this vessel of unknown material of unusual colour and of extraordinary form was presented to Henry the Elder King of the English as a valuable gift was then given to the Queens brother David King of the Scots and was kept for several years in the treasury of Scotland. A few years ago as I have heard from good authority it was given by William King of the Scots to Henry the Second who wished to see it.
One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmers hencoop and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. Good news good news he cried. Why what is that said the Cock. King Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird henceforth but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship. Why that is good news said the Cock and there I see some one coming with whom we can share the good tidings. And so saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off. What is it you see said the Fox. It is only my masters Dog that is coming towards us. What going so soon he continued as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he had heard the news. Will you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the reign of universal peace I would gladly do so said the Fox but I fear he may not have heard of King Lions decree. Cunning often outwits itself.
There was once a very old man whose eyes had become dim his ears dull of hearing his knees trembled and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon and spilt the broth upon the tablecloth or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his sons wife were disgusted at this so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.Listen to The Old Man and His Grandson plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devicesThe Old Man had to sit by himself and ate his food from a wooden bowl. Illustration by Arthur Rackham published in Hansel  Grethel  Other Tales by Brothers Grimm 1920 E.P. Dutton and Company.Once too his trembling hands could not hold the bowl and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few halfpence out of which he had to eat.They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. What are you doing there asked the father. I am making a little trough answered the child for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.The man and his wife looked at each other for a while and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table and hence forth always let him eat with them and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.
Once upon a time there was a man who dug up a big earthenware cask in his field. So he took it home with him and told his wife to clean it out. But when his wife started brushing the inside of the cask the cask suddenly began to fill itself with brushes. No matter how many were taken out others kept on taking their place. So the man sold the brushes and the family managed to live quite comfortably.Once a coin fell into the cask by mistake. At once the brushes disappeared and the cask began to fill itself with money. So now the family became rich for they could take as much money out of the cask as ever they wished.Now the man had an old grandfather at home who was weak and shaky. Since there was nothing else he could do his grandson set him to work shoveling money out of the cask and when the old grandfather grew weary and could not keep on he would fall into a rage and shout at him angrily telling him he was lazy and did not want to work. One day however the old mans strength gave out and he fell into the cask and died. At once the money disappeared and the whole cask began to fill itself with dead grandfathers. Then the man had to pull them all out and have them buried and for this purpose he had to use up again all the money he had received. And when he was through the cask broke and he was just as poor as before.
Somewhere nowhere in a certain kingdom in a certain empire time out of mind and in no land of ours dwelt a Tsar who was so proud so very proud that he feared neither God nor man. He listened to no good counsel from whithersoever it might come but did only that which was good in his own eyes and nobody durst put him right. And all his ministers and nobles grieved exceedingly and all the people grieved likewise.One day this Tsar went to church the priest was reading from Holy Scripture and so he needs must listen. Now there were certain words there which pleased him not. To say such words to me thought he words that I can never forget though I grow greyheaded. After service the Tsar went home and bade them send the priest to him. The priest came. How durst thou read such and such passages to me said the Tsar.They were written to be read replied the priest.Written indeed And wouldst thou then read everything that is written Smear those places over with grease and never dare to read them again I sayTis not I who have written those words your Majesty said the priest nor is it for such as I to smear them over.What thou dost presume to teach me I am the Tsar and it is thy duty to obey me.In all things will I obey thee O Tsar save only in sacred things. God is over them men cannot alter them.Not alter them roared the Tsar if I wish them altered altered they must be. Strike me out those words instantly I say and never dare read them in church again. Dost hearI dare not said the priest I have no will in the matter.I command thee fellowI dare not O TsarWell said the Tsar Ill give thee three days to think about it and on the evening of the fourth day appear before me and Ill strike thy head from thy shoulders if thou dost not obey me Then the priest bowed low and went home.The third day was already drawing to a close and the priest knew not what to do. It was no great terror to him to die for the faith but what would become of his wife and children He walked about and wept and wrung his hands Oh woe is me woe is me At last he lay down on his bed but sleep he could not. Only toward dawn did he doze off then he saw in a dream an angel standing at his head. Fear nothing said the angel. God hath sent me down on earth to protect thee So early in the morning the priest rose up full of joy and prayed gratefully to God.The Tsar also awoke early in the morning and bawled to his huntsmen to gather together and go ahunting with him in the forest.So away they went hunting in the forest and it was not long before a stag leaped out of the thicket beneath the very eyes of the Tsar. Off after it went the Tsar every moment the stag seemed to be faltering and yet the Tsar could never quite come up with it. Hot with excitement the Tsar spurred his horse on yet faster. Gee up gee up he cried now weve got him But here a stream crossed the road and the stag plunged into the water. The Tsar was a good swimmer. Ive got him now at any rate thought he. A little longer and I shall hold him by the horns. So the Tsar took off his clothes and into the water he plunged after the stag. But the stag swam across to the opposite bank and the Tsar was extending his hand to seize him by the hornswhen there was no longer any stag to be seen. It was the angel who had taken the form of a stag. The Tsar was amazed. He looked about him on every side and wondered where the stag had gone. Then he saw some one on the other side of the river putting on his clothes and presently the man mounted his horse and galloped away. The Tsar thought it was some evildoer but it was the selfsame angel that had now put on the Tsars clothes and gone away to collect the huntsmen and take them home. As for the Tsar he remained all naked and solitary in the forest.At last he looked about him and saw far far away smoke rising above the forest and something like a dark cloud standing in the clear sky. Maybe thought he that is my huntingpavilion. So he went in the direction of the smoke and came at last to a brickkiln. The brickburners came forth to meet him and were amazed to see a naked man. What is he doing here they thought. And they saw that his feet were lame and bruised and his body covered with scratches. Give me to drink said he and I would fain eat something also. The brickburners had pity on him they gave him an old tattered garment to wear and a piece of black bread and a gherkin to eat. Never from the day of his birth had the Tsar had such a tasty meal. And now speak O man said they who art thouIll tell you who I am said he when he had eaten his fill I am your Tsar. Lead me to my capital and there I will reward youWhat thou wretched rogue they cried thou dost presume to mock us thou old ragamuffin and magnify thyself into a Tsar Thou reward us indeed And they looked at him in amazement and scorn.Dare to laugh at me again said he and Ill have your heads chopped off For he forgot himself and thought he was at home.What thou Then they fell upon him and beat him. They beat him and hauled him about most unmercifully and then they drove him away and off he went bellowing through the forest.He went on and on till at last he saw once more a smoke rising up out of the wood. Again he thought That is surely my huntingpavilion and so he went up to it. And toward evening he came to another brickkiln. There too they had pity upon and kindly entreated him. They gave him to eat and to drink. They also gave him ragged hose and a tattered shirt for they were very poor people. They took him to be a runaway soldier or some other poor man but when he had eaten his fill and clothed himself he said to them I am your Tsar They laughed at him and again he began to talk roughly to the people. Then they fell upon him and thrashed him soundly and drove him right away. And he wandered all by himself through the forest till it was night. Then he laid him down beneath a tree and so he passed the night and rising up very early fared on his way straight before him.At last he came to a third brickkiln but he did not tell the brickburners there that he was the Tsar. All he thought of now was how he might reach his capital. The people here too treated him kindly and seeing that his feet were lame and bruised they had compassion upon him and gave him a pair of very very old boots. And he asked them Do ye know by which way I can get to the capital They told him but it was a long long journey that would take the whole day.So he went the way they had told him and he went on and on till he came to a little town and there the roadside sentries stopped him. Halt they cried. He halted. Your passportI have none.What no passport Then thou art a vagabond. Seize him they cried. So they seized him and put him in a dungeon. Shortly after they came to examine him and asked him Whence art thouFrom such and such a capital said he. Then they ordered him to be put in irons and taken thither.So they took him back to that capital and put him in another dungeon. Then the custodians came round to examine the prisoners and one said one thing and one said another till at last it came to the turn of the Tsar.Who art thou old man they asked. Then he told them the whole truth. Once I was the Tsar said he and he related all that had befallen him. Then they were much amazed for he was not at all like a Tsar. For indeed he had been growing thin and haggard for a long time and his beard was all long and tangled. And yet for all that he stood them out that he was the Tsar. So they made up their minds that he was crazy and drove him away. Why should we keep this fool for ever said they and waste the Tsars bread upon him So they let him go and never did any man feel so wretched on Gods earth as did that wretched Tsar. Willingly would he have done any sort of work if he had only known how but he had never been used to work so he had to go along begging his bread and could scarce beg enough to keep body and soul together. He lay at night at the first place that came to hand sometimes in the tall grass of the steppes sometimes beneath a fence. That it should ever have come to this he sighed.But the angel who had made himself Tsar went home with the huntsmen. And no man knew that he was not a Tsar but an angel. The same evening that priest came to him and said Do thy will O Tsar and strike off my head for I cannot blot out one word of Holy Scripture.And the Tsar said to him Glory be to God for now I know that there is at least one priest in my tsardom who stands firm for Gods Word. Ill make thee the highest bishop in this realm. The priest thanked him bowed down to the earth and departed marvelling. What is this wonder thought he that the haughty Tsar should have become so just and gentle.But all men marvelled at the change that had come over the Tsar. He was now so mild and gracious nor did he spend all his days in the forest but went about inquiring of his people if any were wronged or injured by their neighbours and if justice were done. He took count of all and rebuked the unjust judges and saw that every man had his rights. And the people now rejoiced as much as they had grieved heretofore and justice was done in all the tribunals and no bribes were taken.But the Tsar the real Tsar grew more and more wretched. Then after three years a ukase went forth that on such and such a day all the people were to come together to a great banquet given by the Tsar all were to be there both rich and poor both high and lowly. And all the people came and the unhappy Tsar came too. And so many long tables were set out in the Tsars courtyard that all the people praised God when they saw the glad sight. And they all sat down at table and ate and drank and the Tsar himself and his courtiers distributed the meat and drink to the guests as much as they would but to the unfortunate Tsar they gave a double portion of everything. And they all ate and drank their fill and then the Tsar began to inquire of the people whether any had suffered wrong or had not had justice done him. And when the people began to disperse the Tsar stood at the gate with a bag of money and gave to every one a grivna a coin but to the unhappy Tsar he gave three.And after three years the Tsar gave another banquet and again entertained all the people. And when he had given them both to eat and to drink as much as they would he inquired of them what was being done in his tsardom and again gave a grivna to each one of them but to the unlucky Tsar he gave a double portion of meat and drink and three grivni.And again after three years he made yet another banquet and proclaimed that all should come both rich and poor both earls and churls. And all the people came and ate and drank and bowed low before the Tsar and thanked him and made ready to depart. The unlucky Tsar was also on the point of going when the angel Tsar stopped him and took him aside into the palace and said to him Lo God hath tried thee and chastised thy pride these ten years. But me He sent to teach thee that a Tsar must have regard to the complaints of his people. So thou wast made poor and a vagabond on the face of the earth that thou mightst pick up wisdom if but a little. Look now that thou doest good to thy people and judgest righteous judgment as from henceforth thou shalt be Tsar again but I must fly back to God in heaven.And when he had said this he bade them wash and shave him for his beard had grown right down to his girdle and put upon him the raiment of a Tsar. And the angel said further Go now into the inner apartments. There the courtiers of the Tsar are sitting and making merry and none will recognize in thee the vagabond old man. May God help thee always to do good And when the angel had said this he was no more to be seen and only his clothes remained on the floor.Then the Tsar prayed gratefully to God and went to the merrymaking of his courtiers and henceforth he ruled his people justly as the angel had bidden him.
Once upon a time Luck met Intelligence on a gardenseat. Make room for me said Luck. Intelligence was then as yet inexperienced and didnt know who ought to make room for whom. He said Why should I make room for you youre no better than I am. Hes the better man answered Luck who performs most. See you there yon peasants son whos ploughing in the field Enter into him and if he gets on better through you than through me Ill always submissively make way for you whensoever and wheresoever we meet. Intelligence agreed and entered at once into the ploughboys head. As soon as the ploughboy felt that he had intelligence in his head he began to think Why must I follow the plough to the day of my death I can go somewhere else and make my fortune more easily. He left off ploughing put up the plough and drove home. Daddy says he I dont like this peasants life Id rather learn to be a gardener. His father said What ails you Vanek have you lost your wits However he bethought himself and said Well if you will learn and God be with you Your brother will be heir to the cottage after me. Vanek lost the cottage but he didnt care for that but went and put himself apprentice to the kings gardener. For every little that the gardener showed him Vanek comprehended ever so much more. Ere long he didnt even obey the gardeners orders as to how he ought to do anything but did everything his own way. At first the gardener was angry but seeing everything thus getting on better he was content. I see that youve more intelligence than I said he and henceforth let Vanek garden as he thought fit. In no long space of time Vanek made the garden so beautiful that the king took great delight in it and frequently walked in it with the queen and with his only daughter.The princess was a very beautiful damsel but ever since she was twelve years old she had ceased speaking and no one ever heard a single word from her. The king was much grieved and caused proclamation to be made that whoever should bring it to pass that she should speak again should be her husband. Many young kings princes and other great lords announced themselves one after the other but all went away as they had come no one succeeded in causing her to speak. Why shouldnt I too try my luck thought Vanek who knows whether I maynt succeed in bringing her to answer when I ask her a question He at once caused himself to be announced at the palace and the king and his councillors conducted him into the room where the princess was. The kings daughter had a pretty little dog and was very fond of him because he was so clever understanding everything that she wanted. When Vanek went into the room with the king and his councillors he made as if he didnt even see the princess but turned to the dog and said I have heard doggie that you are very clever and I come to you for advice. We are three companions in travel a sculptor a tailor and myself. Once upon a time we were going through a forest and were obliged to pass the night in it. To be safe from wolves we made a fire and agreed to keep watch one after the other. The sculptor kept watch first and for amusement to kill time took a log and carved a damsel out of it. When it was finished he woke the tailor to keep watch in his turn. The tailor seeing the wooden damsel asked what it meant. As you see said the sculptor I was weary and didnt know what to do with myself so I carved a damsel out of a log if you find time hang heavy on your hands you can dress her. The tailor at once took out his scissors needle and thread cut out the clothes stitched away and when they were ready dressed the damsel in them. He then called me to come and keep watch. I too asked him what the meaning of all this was. As you see said the tailor the sculptor found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a damsel out of a log and I for the same reason clothed her and if you find time hanging on your hands you can teach her to speak. And by morning dawn I had actually taught her to speak. But in the morning when my companions woke up each wanted to possess the damsel. The sculptor said I made her the tailor I clothed her. I too maintained my right. Tell me therefore doggie to which of us the damsel belongs The dog said nothing but instead of the dog the princess replied To whom can she belong but to yourself Whats the good of the sculptors damsel without life Whats the good of the tailors dressing without speech You gave her the best gift life and speech and therefore she by right belongs to you. You have passed your own sentence said Vanek I have given you speech again and a new life and you therefore by right belong to me. Then said one of the kings councillors His Royal Grace will give you a plenteous reward for succeeding in unloosing his daughters tongue but you cannot have her to wife as you are of mean lineage. The king said You are of mean lineage I will give you a plenteous reward instead of our daughter. But Vanek wouldnt hear of any other reward and said The king promised without any exception that whoever caused his daughter to speak again should be her husband. A kings word is a law and if the king wants others to observe his laws he must first keep them himself. Therefore the king must give me his daughter. Seize and bind him shouted the councillor. Whoever says the king must do anything offers an insult to his Majesty and is worthy of death. May it please your Majesty to order this malefactor to be executed with the sword The king said Let him be executed. Vanek was immediately bound and led to execution. When they came to the place of execution Luck was there waiting for him and said secretly to Intelligence See how this man has got on through you till he has to lose his head Make way and let me take your place As soon as Luck entered Vanek the executioners sword broke against the scaffold just as if someone had snapped it and before they brought him another up rode a trumpeter on horseback from the city galloping as swift as a bird trumpeted merrily and waved a white flag and after him came the royal carriage for Vanek. This is what had happened The princess had told her father at home that Vanek had but spoken the truth and the kings word ought not to be broken. If Vanek were of mean lineage the king could easily make him a prince. The king said Youre right let him be a prince The royal carriage was immediately sent for Vanek and the councillor who had irritated the king against him was executed in his stead. Afterwards when Vanek and the princess were going together in a carriage from the wedding Intelligence happened to be somewhere on the road and seeing that he couldnt help meeting Luck bent his head and slipped on one side just as if cold water had been thrown upon him. And from that time forth it is said that Intelligence has always given a wide berth to Luck whenever he has had to meet him.
A Farmer placed nets on his newlysown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. Pray save me Master he said and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides I am no Crane I am a Stork a bird of excellent character and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too at my feathersthey are not the least like those of a Crane. The Farmer laughed aloud and said It may be all as you say I only know this I have taken you with these robbers the Cranes and you must die in their company.Birds of a feather flock together.
In Tipperary is one of the most singularly shaped hills in the world. It has got a peak at the top like a conical nightcap thrown carelessly over your head as you awake in the morning. On the very point is built a sort of lodge where in the summer the lady who built it and her friends used to go on parties of pleasure but that was long after the days of the fairies and it is I believe now deserted.But before lodge was built or acre sown there was close to the head of this bill a large pasturage where a herdsman spent his days and nights among the herd. The spot had been an old fairy ground and the good people were angry that the scene of their light and airy gambols should be trampled by the rude hoofs of bulls and cows. The lowing of the cattle sounded sad in their ears and the chief of the fairies of the hill determined in person to drive away the new comers and the way she thought of was this. When the harvest nights came on and the moon shone bright and brilliant over the hill and the cattle were lying down hushed and quiet and the herdsman wrapt in his mantle was musing with his heart gladdened by the glorious company of the stars twinkling above him she would come and dance before him  now in one shape  now in another but all ugly and frightful to behold. One time she would be a great horse with the wings of an eagle and a tail like a dragon hissing loud and spitting fire. Then in a moment she would change into a little man lame of a leg with a bulls head and a lambent flame playing round it. Then into a great ape with ducks feet and a turkey cocks tail. But I should be all day about it were I to tell you all the shapes she took. And then she would roar or neigh or hiss or bellow or howl or hoot as never yet was roaring neighing hissing bellowing howling or hooting heard in this world before or since. The poor herdsman would cover his face and call on all the saints for help but it was no use. With one puff of her breath she would blow away the fold of his great Coat let him hold it never so tightly over his eyes and not a saint in heaven paid him the slightest attention. And to make matters worse he never could stir no nor even shut his eyes but there was obliged to stay held by what power he knew not gazing at these terrible sights until the hair of his head would lift his hat half a foot over his crown and his teeth would be ready to fall out from chattering. But the cattle would scamper about mad as if they were bitten by the fly and this would last until the sun rose over the hill.The poor cattle from want of rest were pining away and food did them no good besides they met with accidents without end. Never a night passed that some of them did not fall into a pit and get maimed or may be killed Some would tumble into a river and be drowned in a word there seemed never to be an end of the accidents. But what made the matter worse there could not be a herdsman got to tend the cattle by night. One visit from the fairy drove the stoutesthearted almost mad. The owner of the ground did not know what to do. He offered double treble quadruple wages but not a man could be found for the sake of money to go through the horror of facing the fairy. She rejoiced at the successful issue of her project and continued her pranks. The herd gradually thinning and no man daring to remain on the ground the fairies came back in numbers and gambolled as merrily as before quaffing dewdrops from acorns and spreading their feast on the heads of capacious mushrooms.What was to be done the puzzled farmer thought in vain. He found that his substance was daily diminishing his people terrified and his rent day coming round. It is no Wonder that he looked gloomy and walked mournfully down the road. Now in that part of the world dwelt a man of the name of Larry Hoolahan who played on the pipes better than any other player within fifteen parishes. A roving dashing blade was Larry and feared nothing. Give him plenty of liquor and he would defy the devil. He would face a mad bull or fight singlehanded against a fair. In one of his gloomy walks the farmer met him and on Larrys asking the cause of his down looks he told him all his misfortunes.  If that is all ails you said Larry make your mind easy. Were there as many fairies on Knocksheogowna as there are potato blossoms in Eliogurty I would face them. It would be a queer thing indeed if I who never was afraid of a proper man should turn my back upon a brat of a fairy not the bigness of ones thumb.  Larry said the farmer  do not talk so bold for you know not who is hearing you but if you make your words good and watch my herds for a week on the top of the mountain your hand shall be free of my dish till the sun has burnt itself down to the bigness of a farthing rushlight.The bargain was struck and Larry went to the hilltop when the moon began to peep over the brow. He had been regaled at the farmers house and was bold with the extract of barleycorn. So he took his seat on a big stone under a hollow of the bill with his back to the wind and pulled out his pipes. He had not played long when the voice of the fairies was heard upon the blast like a slow stream of music. Presently they burst out into a loud laugh and Larry could plainly hear one say What another man upon the fairies ring Go to him queen and make him repent his rashness and they flew away. Larry felt them pass by his face as they flew like a swarm of midges and looking up hastily he saw between the moon and him a great black cat standing on the very tip of its claws with its back up and mewing with the voice of a watermill. Presently it swelled up towards the sky and turning round on its left hind leg whirled till it fell to the ground from which it started up in the shape of a salmon with a cravat round its neck and a pair of new top boots.  Go on jewel said Larry if you dance Ill pipe  and he struck up. So she turned into this and that and the other but still Larry played on as he well knew how. At last she lost patience as ladies will do when you do not mind their scolding and changed herself into a calf milkwhite as the cream of Cork and with eyes as mild as those of the girl I love. She came up gentle and fawning in hopes to throw him off his guard by quietness and then to work him some wrong. But Larry was not so deceived for when she came up he dropping his pipes leaped upon her back.Now from the top of Knocksheogowna as you look westward to the broad Atlantic you will see the Shannon queen of rivers  spreading like a sea and running on in gentle course to mingle with the ocean through the fair city of Limerick. It on this night shone under the moon and looked beautiful from the distant hill. Fifty boats were gliding up and down on the sweet current and the song of the fishermen rose gaily from the shore. Larry as I said before leaped upon the back of the fairy and she rejoiced at the opportunity sprung from the hilltop and bounded clear at one jump over the Shannon flowing as it was just ten miles from the mountains base. It was done in a second and when 8he alighted on the distant bank kicking up her heels she flung Larry on the soft turf. No sooner was he thus planted than he looked her straight in the face and scratching his head cried out By my word well done that was not a bad leap for a calfShe looked at him for a moment and then assumed her own shape. Laurence said she you are a bold fellow will you come back the way you went And thats what I will said he if you let me. So changing to a calf again again Larry got on her back and at another bound they were again upon the top of Knocksheogowna. The fairy once more resuming her figure addressed him You have shown so much courage Laurence said she that while you keep herds on this hill you never shall be molested by me or mine. The day dawns go down to the farmer and tell him this and if any thing I can do may be of service to you ask and you shall have it. She vanished accordingly and kept her word in never visiting the hill during Larrys life but he never troubled her with requests. He piped and drank at the farmers expense and roosted in his chimney corner occasionally casting an eye to the flock. He died at last and is buried in a green valley of pleasant Tipperary but whether the fairies returned to the hill of Knocksheogown after his death is more than I can say.
There was once a king who had a daughter whose name was Stella. She was indescribably beautiful but was so whimsical and hard to please that she drove her father to despair. There had been princes and kings who had sought her in marriage but she had found defects in them all and would have none of them. She kept advancing in years and her father began to despair of knowing to whom he should leave his crown. So he summoned his council and discussed the matter and was advised to give a great banquet to which he should invite all the princes and kings of the surrounding countries for as they said there cannot fail to be among so many some one who should please the princess who was to hide behind a door so that she could examine them all as she pleased.When the king heard this advice he gave the orders necessary for the banquet and then called his daughter and said Listen my little Stella I have thought to do so and so to see if I can find any one to please you behold my daughter my hair is white and I must have some one to leave my crown to. Stella bowed her head saying that she would take care to please him. Princes and kings then began to arrive at the court and when it was time for the banquet they all seated themselves at the table.You can imagine what sort of a banquet that was and how the hall was adorned gold and silver shone from all their necks in the four corners of the room were four fountains which continually sent forth wine and the most exquisite perfumes. While the gentlemen were eating Stella was behind a door as has been said and one of her maids who was near by pointed out to her now this one now that one. See your Majesty what a handsome youth that is there. Yes but he has too large a nose. And the one near your father He has eyes that look like saucers. And that other at the head of the table He has too large a mouth he looks as if he liked to eat.In short she found fault with all but one who she said pleased her but that he must be a very dirty fellow for he had a crumb on his beard after eating. The youth heard her say this and swore vengeance. You must know that he was the son of the king of Green Hill and the handsomest youth that could be seen. When the banquet was finished and the guests had departed the king called Stella and asked What news have you my child She replied that the only one who pleased her was the one with the crumb in his beard but that she believed him to be a dirty fellow and did not want him. Take care my daughter you will repent it answered her father and turned away.You must know that Stellas chamber looked into a courtyard into which opened the shop of a baker. One night while she was preparing to retire she heard in the room where they sifted the meal some one singing so well and with so much grace that it went to her heart. She ran to the window and listened until he finished. Then she began to ask her maid who the person with the beautiful voice could be saying she would like to know. Leave it to me your Majesty said the maid I will inform you tomorrow. Stella could not wait for the next day and indeed early the next day she learned that the one who sang was the sifter. That evening she heard him sing again and stood by the window until everything became quiet. But that voice had so touched her heart that she told her maid that the next day she would try and see who had that fine voice. In the morning she placed herself by the window and soon saw the youth come forth. She was enchanted by his beauty as soon as she saw him and fell desperately in love with him.Now you must know that this was none other than the prince who was at the banquet and whom Stella had called dirty. So he had disguised himself in such a way that she could not recognize him and was meanwhile preparing his revenge. After he had seen her once or twice he began to take off his hat and salute her. She smiled at him and appeared at the window every moment. Then they began to exchange words and in the evening he sang under her window. In short they began to make love in good earnest and when he learned that she was free he began to talk about marrying her. She consented at once but asked him what he had to live on. I havent a penny said he the little I earn is hardly enough to feed me.Stella encouraged him saying that she would give him all the money and things he wanted. To punish Stella for her pride her father and the princes father had an understanding and pretended not to know about this love affair and let her carry away from the palace all she owned. During the day Stella did nothing but make a great bundle of clothes of silver and of money and at night the disguised prince came under the balcony and she threw it down to him. Things went on in this manner some time and finally one evening he said to her Listen. The time has come to elope. Stella could not wait for the hour and the next night she quietly tied a cord about her and let herself down from the window. The prince aided her to the ground and then took her arm and hastened away.He led her a long ways to another city where he turned down a street and opened the first door he met. They went down a long passage finally they reached a little door which he opened and they found themselves in a hole of a place which had only one window high up. The furniture consisted of a straw bed a bench and a dirty table. You can imagine that when Stella saw herself in this place she thought she should die. When the prince saw her so amazed he said What is the matter Does the house not please you Do you not know that I am a poor man Have you been deceived What have you done with all the things I gave youOh I had many debts and I have paid them and then I have done with the rest what seemed good to me. You must make up your mind to work and gain your bread as I have done. You must know that I am a porter of the king of this city and I often go and work at the palace. Tomorrow they have told me the washing is to be done so you must rise early and go with me there. I will set you to work with the other women and when it is time for them to go home to dinner you will say that you are not hungry and while you are alone steal two shirts conceal them under your skirt and carry them home to me. Poor Stella wept bitterly saying it was impossible for her to do that but her husband replied Do what I say or I shall beat you. The next morning her husband rose with the dawn and made her get up too. He had bought her a striped skirt and a pair of coarse shoes which he made her put on and then took her to the palace with him conducted her to the laundry and left her after he had introduced her as his wife saying that she should remember what awaited her at home.Then the prince ran and dressed himself like a king and waited at the gate of the palace until it was time for his wife to come. Meanwhile poor Stella did as her husband had commanded and stole the shirts. As she was leaving the palace she met the king who said Pretty girl you are our porters wife are you not Then he asked her what she had under her skirt and shook her until the shirts dropped out and the king cried See there the porters wife is a thief she has stolen some shirts.Poor Stella ran home in tears and her husband followed her when he had put on his disguise again. When he reached home Stella told him all that had happened and begged him not to send her to the palace again but he told her that the next day they were to bake and she must go into the kitchen and help and steal a piece of dough. Everything happened as on the previous day. Stellas theft was discovered and when her husband returned he found her crying like a condemned soul and swearing that she had rather be killed than go to the palace again. He told her however that the kings son was to be married the next day and that there was to be a great banquet and she must go into the kitchen and wash the dishes. He added that when she had the chance she must steal a pot of broth and hide it about her so that no one should see it.She had to do as she was told and had scarcely concealed the pot when the kings son came into the kitchen and told his wife she must come to the ball that had followed the banquet. She did not wish to go but he took her by the arm and led her into the midst of the festival. Imagine how the poor woman felt at that ball dressed as she was and with the pot of broth The king began to poke his sword at her in jest until he hit the pot and all the broth ran on the floor. Then all began to jeer her and laugh until poor Stella fainted away from shame and they had to go and get some vinegar to revive her. At last the kings mother came forward and said Enough you have revenged yourself sufficiently. Then turning to Stella Know that this is your mother and that he has done this to correct your pride and to be avenged on you for calling him dirty. Then she took her by the arm and led her to another room where her maids dressed her as a queen. Her father and mother then appeared and kissed and embraced her. Her husband begged her pardon for what he had done and they made peace and always lived in harmony. From that day on she was never haughty and had learned to her cost that pride is the greatest fault.
The Phaton who drove a load of hayOnce found his cart bemired.Poor man the spot was far awayFrom human helpretiredIn some rude country placeIn Brittany as near as I can traceNear Quimper CorentanA town that poet never sangWhich Fate they say puts in the travellers pathWhen she would rouse the man to special wrath.May Heaven preserve us from that routeBut to our carter hale and stoutFast stuck his cart he swore his worstAnd filld with rage extremeThe mudholes now he cursedAnd now he cursed his teamAnd now his cart and loadAnon the like upon himself bestowd.Upon the god he calld at lengthMost famous through the world for strength.O help me Hercules cried he for if thy back of yoreThis burly planet bore thy arm can set me free.This prayer gone up from out a cloud there brokeA voice which thus in godlike accents spokeThe suppliant must himself bestirEre Hercules will aid confer.Look wisely in the proper quarterTo see what hindrance can be foundRemove the execrable mud and mortarWhich axledeep beset thy wheels around.Thy sledge and crowbar takeAnd pry me up that stone or breakNow fill that rut upon the other side.Hast done it Yes the man replied.Well said the voice Ill aid thee nowTake up thy whip.

It is a great truth that from the same wood are formed the statues of idols and the rafters of gallows kings thrones and cobblers stalls and another strange thing is that from the same rags are made the paper on which the wisdom of sages is recorded and the crown which is placed on the head of a fool. The same too may be said of children one daughter is good and another bad one idle another a good housewife one fair another ugly one spiteful another kind one unfortunate another born to good luck and who being all of one family ought to be of one nature. But leaving this subject to those who know more about it I will merely give you an example in the story of the three daughters of the same mother wherein you will see the difference of manners which brought the wicked daughters into the ditch and the good daughter to the top of the Wheel of Fortune.There was at one time a woman who had three daughters two of whom were so unlucky that nothing ever succeeded with them all their projects went wrong all their hopes were turned to chaff. But the youngest who was named Nella was born to good luck and I verily believe that at her birth all things conspired to bestow on her the best and choicest gifts in their power. The Sky gave her the perfection of its light Venus matchless beauty of form Love the first dart of his power Nature the flower of manners. She never set about any work that it did not go off to a nicety she never took anything in hand that it did not succeed to a hair she never stood up to dance that she did not sit down with applause. On which account she was envied by her jealous sisters and yet not so much as she was loved and wished well to by all others as greatly as her sisters desired to put her underground so much more did other folks carry her on the palms of their hands.Now there was in that country an enchanted Prince who was so attracted by her beauty that he secretly married her. And in order that they might enjoy one anothers company without exciting the suspicion of the mother who was a wicked woman the Prince made a crystal passage which led from the royal palace directly into Nellas apartment although it was eight miles distant. Then he gave her a certain powder saying Every time you wish to see me throw a little of this powder into the fire and instantly I will come through this passage as quick as a bird running along the crystal road to gaze upon this face of silver.Having arranged it thus not a night passed that the Prince did not go in and out backwards and forwards along the crystal passage until at last the sisters who were spying the actions of Nella found out the secret and laid a plan to put a stop to the sport. And in order to cut the thread at once they went and broke the passage here and there so that when the unhappy girl threw the powder into the fire to give the signal to her husband the Prince who used always to come running in furious haste hurt himself in such a manner against the broken crystal that it was truly a pitiable sight to see. And being unable to pass further on he turned back all cut and slashed like a Dutchmans breeches. Then he sent for all the doctors in the town but as the crystal was enchanted the wounds were mortal and no human remedy availed. When the King saw this despairing of his sons condition he sent out a proclamation that whoever would cure the wounds of the Princeif a woman she should have him for a husbandif a man he should have half his kingdom.Now when Nella who was pining away from the loss of the Prince heard this she dyed her face disguised herself and unknown to her sisters she left home to go to see him before his death. But as by this time the Suns gilded ball with which he plays in the Fields of Heaven was running towards the west night overtook her in a wood close to the house of an ogre where in order to get out of the way of danger she climbed up into a tree. Meanwhile the ogre and his wife were sitting at table with the windows open in order to enjoy the fresh air while they ate as soon as they had emptied their cups and put out the lamps they began to chat of one thing and another so that Nella who was as near to them as the mouth to the nose heard every word they spoke.Among other things the ogress said to her husband My pretty HairyHide tell me what news what do they say abroad in the world And he answered Trust me there is no hands breadth clean everythings going topsyturvy and awry. But what is it replied his wife. Why I could tell pretty stories of all the confusion that is going on replied the ogre for one hears things that are enough to drive one mad such as buffoons rewarded with gifts rogues esteemed cowards honoured robbers protected and honest men little thought of. But as these things only vex one I will merely tell you what has befallen the Kings son. He had made a crystal path along which he used to go to visit a pretty lass but by some means or other I know not how all the road has been broken and as he was going along the passage as usual he has wounded himself in such a manner that before he can stop the leak the whole conduit of his life will run out. The King has indeed issued a proclamation with great promises to whoever cures his son but it is all labour lost and the best he can do is quickly to get ready mourning and prepare the funeral.When Nella heard the cause of the Princes illness she sobbed and wept bitterly and said to herself Who is the wicked soul who has broken the passage and caused so much sorrow But as the ogress now went on speaking Nella was as silent as a mouse and listened.And is it possible said the ogress that the world is lost to this poor Prince and that no remedy can be found for his maladyHarkye Granny replied the ogre the doctors are not called upon to find remedies that may pass the bounds of nature. This is not a fever that will yield to medicine and diet much less are these ordinary wounds which require lint and oil for the charm that was on the broken glass produces the same effect as onion juice does on the iron heads of arrows which makes the wound incurable. There is one thing only that could save his life but dont ask me to tell it to you for it is a thing of importance.Do tell me dear old Longtusk cried the ogress tell me if you would not see me die.Well then said the ogre I will tell you provided you promise me not to confide it to any living soul for it would be the ruin of our house and the destruction of our lives.Fear nothing my dear sweet little husband replied the ogress for you shall sooner see pigs with horns apes with tails moles with eyes than a single word shall pass my lips. And so saying she put one hand upon the other and swore to it.You must know then said the ogre that there is nothing under the sky nor above the ground that can save the Prince from the snares of death but our fat. If his wounds are anointed with this his soul will be arrested which is just at the point of leaving the dwelling of his body.Nella who overheard all that passed gave time to Time to let them finish their chat and then getting down from the tree and taking heart she knocked at the ogres door crying Ah my good masters I pray you for charity alms some sign of compassion. Have a little pity on a poor miserable wretched creature who is banished by fate far from her own country and deprived of all human aid who has been overtaken by night in this wood and is dying of cold and hunger. And crying thus she went on knocking and knocking at the door.Upon hearing this deafening noise the ogress was going to throw her half a loaf and send her away. But the ogre who was more greedy of flesh than the squirrel is of nuts the bear of honey the cat of fish the sheep of salt or the ass of bran said to his wife Let the poor creature come in for if she sleeps in the fields who knows but she may be eaten up by some wolf. In short he talked so much that his wife at length opened the door for Nella whilst with all his pretended charity he was all the time reckoning on making four mouthfuls of her. But the glutton counts one way and the host another for the ogre and his wife drank till they were fairly tipsy. When they lay down to sleep Nella took a knife from a cupboard and made a hash of them in a trice. Then she put all the fat into a phial went straight to the court where presenting herself before the King she offered to cure the Prince. At this the King was overjoyed and led her to the chamber of his son and no sooner had she anointed him well with the fat than the wound closed in a moment just as if she had thrown water on the fire and he became sound as a fish.When the King saw this he said to his son This good woman deserves the reward promised by the proclamation and that you should marry her. But the Prince replied It is hopeless for I have no storeroom full of hearts in my body to share among so many my heart is already disposed of and another woman is already the mistress of it. Nella hearing this replied You should no longer think of her who has been the cause of all your misfortune. My misfortune has been brought on me by her sisters replied the Prince and they shall repent it. Then do you really love her said Nella. And the Prince replied More than my own life. Embrace me then said Nella for I am the fire of your heart. But the Prince seeing the dark hue of her face answered I would sooner take you for the coal than the fire so keep offdont blacken me. Whereupon Nella perceiving that he did not know her called for a basin of clean water and washed her face. As soon as the cloud of soot was removed the sun shone forth and the Prince recognising her pressed her to his heart and acknowledged her for his wife. Then he had her sisters thrown into an oven thus proving the truth of the old sayingNo evil ever went without punishment.
Come listen to a tale of times of oldCome listen to meIt was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named Mick Purcell rented a few acres of barren ground in the neighbourhood of the once celebrated preceptory of Mourne situated about three miles from Mallow and thirteen from the beautiful city called Cork. Mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor man had no child grown up big enough to help him in his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and to carry the eggs to market to Mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent. Well they did manage it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pig got the measlesshe was sold in Mallow and brought almost nothing and poor Mick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due.Why then Molly says he whatll we doWisha then mavournene what would you do but take the cow to the fair of Cork and sell her says she and Monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested again the fair.And whatll we do when shes gone says Mick sorrowfully.Never a know I know Mick but sure God wont leave us without Him Mick and you know how good He was to us when poor little Billy was sick and we had nothing at all for him to take that good doctor gentleman at Ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us two shillings and how he sent the things and bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast when I went over to ask a question so he did and how he came to see Billy and never left off his goodness till he was quite wellOh you are always that way Molly and I believe you are right after all so I wont be sorry for selling the cow but Ill go tomorrow and you must put a needle and thread through my coat for you know tis ripped under the arm.Molly told him he should have every thing right and about twelve oclock next day he left her getting a charge not to sell his cow except for the highest penny. Mick promised to mind it and went his way along the road. He drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and runs by the old walls of Mourne. As he passed he glanced his eye upon the towers and one of the old elder trees which were only then little bits of switches.Oh then if I only had half the money thats buried in you tisnt driving this poor cow Id be now Why then isnt it too bad that it should be there covered over with earth and many a one besides me wanting Well if it is Gods will Ill have some money myself coming back.So saying he moved on after his beast twas a fine day and the sun shone brightly on the walls of the old abbey as he passed under them he then crossed an extensive mountain tract and after six long miles he came to the top of that hillBottle Hill tis called now but that was not the name of it then and just there a man overtook him.Good morrow says he. Good morrow kindly says Mick looking at the stranger who was a little man youd almost call him a dwarf only he wasnt quite so little neither he had a bit of an old wrinkled yellow face for all the world like a dried cauliflower only he had a sharp little nose and red eyes and white hair and his lips were not red but all his face was one colour and his eyes never were quiet but looking at every thing and although they were red they made Mick feel quite cold when he looked at them. In truth he did not much like the little mans company and he couldnt see one bit of his legsnor his body for though the day was warm he was all wrapped up in a big greatcoat. Mick drove his cow something faster but the little man kept up with him. Mick didnt know how he walked for he was almost afraid to look at him and to cross himself for fear the old man would be angry. Yet he thought his fellowtraveller did not seem to walk like other men nor to put one foot before the other but to glide over the rough road and rough enough it was like a shadow without noise and without effort. Micks heart trembled within him and he said a prayer to himself wishing he hadnt come out that day or that he was on fair hill or that he hadnt the cow to mind that he might run away from the bad thingwhen in the midst of his fears he was again addressed by his companion.Where are you going with the cow honest manTo the fair of Cork then says Mick trembling at the shrill and piercing tones of the voice.Are you going to sell her said the stranger.Why then what else am I going for but to sell herWill you sell her to meMick startedhe was afraid to have any thing to do with the little man and he was more afraid to say no.Whatll you give for her at last says he.Ill tell you what Ill give you this bottle said the little one pulling a bottle from under his coat.Mick looked at him and the bottle and in spite of his terror he could not help bursting into a loud fit of laughter.Laugh if you will said the little man but I tell you this bottle is better for you than all the money you will get for the cow in Corkay than ten thousand times as much.Mick laughed again. Why then says he do you think I am such a fool as to give my good cow for a bottleand an empty one too indeed then I wont.You had better give me the cow and take the bottleyoull not be sorry for it.Why then and what would Molly say Id never hear the end of it and how would I pay the rent and what would we all do without a penny of moneyI tell you this bottle is better to you than money take it and give me the cow. I ask you for the last time Mick Purcell.Mick started.How does he know my name thought he.The stranger proceeded Mick Purcell I know you and I have regard for you therefore do as I warn you or you may be sorry for it. How do you know but your cow will die before you get to CorkMick was going to say God forbid but the little man went on and he was too attentive to say any thing to stop him for Mick was a very civil man and he knew better than to interrupt a gentleman and thats what many people that hold their heads higher dont mind now.And how do you know but there will be much cattle at the fair and you will get a bad price or may be you might be robbed when you are coming home but what need I talk more to you when you are determined to throw away your luck Mick PurcellOh no I would not throw away my luck sir said Mick and if I was sure the bottle was as good as you say though I never liked an empty bottle although I had drank what was in it Id give you the cow in the nameNever mind names said the stranger but give me the cow I would not tell you a lie. Here take the bottle and when you go home do what I direct exactly.Mick hesitated.Well then good by I can stay no longer once more take it and be rich refuse it and beg for your life and see your children in poverty and your wife dying for want that will happen to you Mick Purcell said the little man with a malicious grin which made him look ten times more ugly than ever.May be tis true said Mick still hesitating he did not know what to dohe could hardly help believing the old man and at length in a fit of desperation he seized the bottleTake the cow said he and if you are telling a lie the curse of the poor will be on you.I care neither for your curses nor your blessings but I have spoken truth Mick Purcell and that you will find tonight if you do what I tell you.And whats that says Mick.When you go home never mind if your wife is angry but be quiet yourself and make her sweep the room clean set the table out right and spread a clean cloth over it then put the bottle on the ground saying these words Bottle do your duty and you will see the end of it.And is this all says Mick.No more said the stranger. Good by Mick Purcellyou are a rich man.God grant it said Mick as the old man moved after the cow and Mick retraced the road towards his cabin but he could not help turning back his head to look after the purchaser of his cow who was nowhere to be seen.Lord between us and harm said Mick He cant belong to this earth but where is the cow She too was gone and Mick went homeward muttering prayers and holding fast the bottle.And what would I do if it broke thought he. Oh but Ill take care of that so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and doubting of the reception he should meet from his wife balancing his anxieties with his expectations his fears with his hopes he reached home in the evening and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney.Oh Mick are you come back Sure you wernt at Cork all the way What has happened to you Where is the cow Did you sell her How much money did you get for her What news have you Tell us every thing about it.Why then Molly if youll give me time Ill tell you all about it. If you want to know where the cow is tisnt Mick can tell you for the never a know does he know where she is now.Oh then you sold her and wheres the moneyArrah stop awhile Molly and Ill tell you all about it.But what is that bottle under your waistcoat said Molly spying its neck sticking out.Why then be easy now cant you says Mick till I tell it to you and putting the bottle on the table Thats all I got for the cow.His poor wife was thunderstruck. All you got and what good is that Mick Oh I never thought you were such a fool and whatll we do for the rent and whatNow Molly says Mick cant you hearken to reason Didnt I tell you how the old man or whatsomever he was met meno he did not meet me neither but he was there with meon the big hill and how he made me sell him the cow and told me the bottle was the only thing for meYes indeed the only thing for you you fool said Molly seizing the bottle to hurl it at her poor husbands head but Mick caught it and quietly for he minded the old mans advice loosened his wifes grasp and placed the bottle again in his bosom. Poor Molly sat down crying while Mick told his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm. His wife could not help believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never discouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed in them himself. She got up however without saying one word and began to sweep the earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tidied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it and Mick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said Bottle do your duty.Look there look there mammy said his chubby eldest son a boy about five years oldlook there look there and he sprang to his mothers side as two tiny little fellows rose like light from the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all was done went into the bottle again. Mick and his wife looked at every thing with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishes before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length Molly said Come and sit down Mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work.Why then the man told no lie about the bottle.Mick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half the dishes.Now says Molly I wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these fine things again They waited but no one came so Molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying Why then Mick that was no lie sure enough but youll be a rich man yet Mick Purcell.Mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land. Mick went to Cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and they did all they could to keep the bottle a secret but for all that their landlord found it out for he came to Mick one day and asked him where he got all his moneysure it was not by the farm and he bothered him so much that at last Mick told him of the bottle. His landlord offered him a deal of money for it but Mick would not give it till at last he offered to give him all his farm for ever so Mick who was very rich thought hed never want any more money and gave him the bottle but Mick was mistakenhe and his family spent money as if there was no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at last they had nothing left but one cow and Mick once more drove his cow before him to sell her at Cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle. It was hardly daybreak when he left home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleeping in the valleys and curling like smokewreaths upon the brown heath around him. The sun rose on his left and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song ascending into the clear blue skyTill its form like a speck in the airiness blendingAnd thrilling with music was melting in light.Mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark but thinking notwithstanding all the time of the little old man when just as he reached the summit of the hill and cast his eyes over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voiceWell Mick Purcell I told you you would be a rich man.Indeed then sure enough I was thats no lie for you sir. Good morning to you but it is not rich I am nowbut have you another bottle for I want it now as much as I did long ago so if you have it sir here is the cow for it.And here is the bottle said the old man smiling you know what to do with it.Oh then sure I do as good right I have.Well farewell forever Mick Purcell I told you you would be a rich man.And good bye to you sir said Mick as he turned back and good luck to you and good luck to the big hillit wants a nameBottle Hill.Good bye sir good bye so Mick walked back as fast as he could never looking after the whitefaced little gentleman and the cow so anxious was he to bring home the bottle. Well he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw MollyOh sure Ive another bottleArrah then have you why then youre a lucky man Mick Purcell thats what you are.In an instant she put every thing right and Mick looking at his bottle exultingly cried out Bottle do your duty. In a twinkling two great stout men with big cudgels issued from the bottle I do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor Mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they went again. Mick as soon as he recovered got up and looked about him he thought and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him he wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to Mick.Well what do you want nowNothing sir only I have another bottle.Oh ho is it as good as the firstYes sir and better if you like I will show it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen.Come along then. So saying Mick was brought into the great hall where he saw his old bottle standing high up on a shelf Ah ha says he to himself may be I wont have you by and by.Now says his landlord show us your bottle. Mick set it on the floor and uttered the words in a moment the landlord was tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaring and sprawling and kicking and shrieking. Wine cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out Stop those two devils Mick Purcell or Ill have you hangedThey never shall stop said Mick till I get my own bottle that I see up there at top of that shelf.Give it down to him give it down to him before we are all killed says the landlord.Mick put the bottle in his bosom in jumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried the bottles home. I need not lengthen my story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upon it ay and so twill be always Bottle Hill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story.
Near Constantinople there lived a man who knew no other occupation but that of catching birds his neighbours called him the birdcatcher. Some he used to sell others served him for food and thus he maintained himself. One day he caught a crow and wanted to let it go but then he had nothing to take home. If I cant catch anything today Ill take my children the crow that they may amuse themselves and they have no other birds at hand. So he intended and so he did. His wife on seeing the crow said What mischief have you brought me Wring the worthless things neck The crow on hearing that sentence besought the birdcatcher to let her go and promised to be always at his service. I will bring birds to you through me you will become prosperous. Even if youre lying its no great loss said the birdcatcher to himself and set the crow at liberty.On the morrow the birdcatcher went out birdcatching as usual and the crow kept her word she brought him two nightingales he caught them both and took them home. The nightingales were not long with the birdcatcher for the grand vizier heard of them sent for the birdcatcher took the two nightingales from him and placed them in the new mosque. The nightingales were able to sing sweetly and agreeably the people collected in front of the mosque and listened to their beautiful singing and the wonder came to the ears of the emperor. The emperor summoned the grand vizier took the birds from him and inquired whence he had got them. When the emperor had thought the matter over he sent his cavasses and they summoned the birdcatcher. Its no joke to go before the emperor I know why he summons me no half torture will be mine. I am guilty of nothing I owe nothing but the emperors will thats my crime said the birdcatcher and went into the emperors presence all pale with fear.Vintage illustration of a nightingale. Circa 1890s.Birdcatcher sirrah are you the catcher of those nightingales which were at the new mosque. Padishah both father and mother where your slipper is there is my faceI am. Sirrah again said the emperor I wish you to find their mother doubtless your reward will be forthcoming. But do you hear You may be quite sure of it if you dont there will be no head on your shoulders. Im not joking. Now the poor fellow went out of the emperors presence and how he got home he didnt know a good two hours afterwards he came to himself and began to lament. Im a fool I thought my trade led nowhither and not to misfortune for me but now see To find the mother of the birdsnone but a fool could imagine itand to catch herTo this lamentation there was neither limit nor end. It was getting dark and his wife summoned him to supper just then the crow was at the window Whats this the crow asked. What are these lamentations Whats the distress Let me alone dont add to my torture Im done for owing to you said the birdcatcher and told her all what it was and how it was. Thats easy answered she go to the emperor tomorrow and ask for a thousand loads of wheat then pile up the corn in one heap and I will inform the birds that the emperor gives them a feast they will all assemble their mother too will doubtless come the one with regard to which I give you a sign is she bring a cage put the two nightingales in it the mother seeing her two young birds will fly up let your snare be ready and then we shall find and catch her.As the crow instructed him so he did. The emperor gave him the corn he feasted the birds caught the mother of the nightingales and took her to the emperor. He received a handsome reward but he would gladly have gone without such reward when he remembered how many tears he had shed. The crow too received a reward for she persuaded the birdcatcher to give his wife a good beating which he did to the satisfaction of the crow in her presence.Time after time behold some of the emperors cavasses Come the emperor summons you sounded from the door. A new misfortune a new sorrow thought the birdcatcher in his heart and went before the emperor. Do you hear sirrah Just now I paid you a good recompensenow a greater one awaits you. I wish you to seek the mistress of those birds otherwise valah bilah your head will be in danger Do you understand me At these words of the emperor the birdcatcher either could not or dared not utter a word he shrugged his shoulders and went out of his presence. As he went home he talked to himself weeping I see that he is determined to destroy me and some devil has put it into his head to torture me first.On arriving at home he found his crow at the window Has some misfortune again occurred to you Dont ask replied the birdcatcher one still blacker and more miserable and told her all in detail what it was and how it was. Dont trouble your head much about that said the crow. Be quick ask the emperor for a boat full of all manner of wares. Then we will push off on the deep sea when people hear that the emperors agent is bringing wares the people will assemble and that lady is sure to come the one on which I perch is she up anchor and off with the boat This the birdcatcher remembered well. What he asked of the emperor that he gave him and he pushed the boat over the sea his bringing wares for sale went from mouth to mouth people came and purchased the wares.At last came the mistress of the birds also and began to examine the wares the crow perched on her shoulder the anchor was raised and in a short time the birdcatcher brought the boat to under the emperors quay. When the birdcatcher brought her before the emperor the emperor was astounded. He didnt know which to admire most the birdcatchers cleverness or her beauty. Her beauty overpowered the emperors mind he rewarded the birdcatcher handsomely and placed the sultana in his house. You are the dearest to me of all said the emperor several times to her if I were to banish all the sultanas you should never go out of my seraglio.The birdcatcher was again in evil case. The new sultana was in a perpetual state of irritation for it was poor luck to be obliged to be affectionate to an elderly longbeard. The emperor comforted her and asked her what failed her when she had everything in abundance with him. A womans revenge is worse than a cats. Not daring to tell the emperor the truth she wanted to revenge herself on the poor birdcatcher. Dear Padishah I had a valuable ring on my hand when that birdcatcher deluded me into the boat and pushed it from the shore. I began to wring my hands in distress the ring broke and one half fell into the sea just where it was my hap to be. But dear sultan if I am a little dear to you send that birdcatcher let him seek that half for me that I may unite it to this one. All shall be done said the emperor and the cavasses soon brought the birdcatcher.My son said the emperor if you do not intend to lose my love and favour hearken to me once more. At the place where you captured that lady she broke a ring it fell into the sea. I know that you can do sofind her that half your reward will not fail otherwise you know . . . . When the poor fellow got home a fit of laughter seized him from distress. I knew that the devil was teaching him how to torment and torture me before he put me to death. If hell were to open all the devils wouldnt find it Whats the matter friend said the crow. Till now you were weeping and complaining and now in a rage you are laughing. He told her allwhat it was and how it was. Dont fret yourself continued the crow. Have you given your wife a good thrashing I wish you to give her a good hiding again when we go down to the sea. And now come ask the emperor for a thousand barrels of oil. The emperor had stores of oil and felt he gave him as much as he required. Everybody thought that he was going to trade with the oil. When he arrived at the place where he captured the young lady the crow gave the word of command and they poured out all the oil into the sea. The sea became violently agitated the crow darted in and found the missing fragment of the ring. The birdcatcher took the boat back thence under the emperors palace and delivered the ring to the emperor he passed it on to the lady and she fitted it to the other half. Both she and the emperor were astonished at the birdcatchers cleverness commended him and sent him home with a present.The emperor wished by every means to induce the young lady to marry him and to have a formal wedding. She for a long time declined but at last said If it is your will I consent but only on condition that before our wedding you destroy that birdcatcher. The emperor now found himself between two fires. It was agony to destroy his benefactor it was worse agony not to he able to withstand his heart and to give up the love of the young lady. Love is eternal and is often stronger even than truth. He summoned the birdcatcher commended him for having so often fulfilled his will and told him that he deserved to sit in the grand viziers seat. . . . But there is nothing else for it but you must go home take leave of your wife children and friends of whom I will undertake the care in the afternoon come you must of necessity jump into the fire.He went home and the crow came to meet him. He told her all that was to be done with him in the afternoon and said to her If you do not help me as usual now I am done for not through my fault nor through the emperors but owing to you. The crow informed him what to do but before he went he was to give his wife a thoroughly good beating. His wife departed this life from so many blows. A fire was flaming before the great mosque the Turks came out of the mosque the emperor came the people swarmed round the fire The birdcatcher came cheerfully before the emperor.Everyone deemed him a malefactor. Fortunate Padishah it is your pleasure to burn me to death. I am happy to be able to be a sacrifice for you. It has occurred to my mind I am anxious to have a ride on a good horse permit me so to do before I jump into the fire. The emperor smiled and ordered his best horse to be brought for him. He mounted and made the horse gallop well when the horse sweated he dismounted anointed himself with the horses foam remounted darted up to the fire then dismounted and darted into the fire. The people looked on five times six times did he cross the flames sprang out of the fire and stood before the emperor as a youth of twenty years of age sound young goodly and handsome. The people cried Mercy emperor He has fulfilled his penalty. And the emperor graciously pardoned him. The emperor now longed to become young and handsome also. He made the birdcatcher grand vizier merely that he might tell him the secret. He said to him My lord it is easy. Take a good horse gallop about an hour as I did dismount when the horse sweats anoint yourself with his perspiration jump into the fire and you will come out such as I am.Friday dawned the emperors best horse was saddled for him everybody thought that he was going to the mosque. A fire was burning furiously in front of the mosque. The people said Theres somebody going to jump in again and they were under no delusion. The emperor darted up to the fire all alone the people looked on to see what was going to happen. The emperor dismounted with great speed and sprang into the fire. . . . The people crowded to rescue the emperortwas all in vain. The emperor was burned to death. He was crazy shouted the chief men and soldiers. They conducted the birdcatcher into the mosque and girt him with the emperors sword. Then the birdcatcher became emperor the damsel he selected sultana and the crow the chief lady at court.
First StoryWHICH DESCRIBES A LOOKINGGLASS AND ITS BROKEN FRAGMENTSYou must attend to the beginning of this story for when we get to the end we shall know more than we now do about a very wicked hobgoblin he was one of the most mischievous of all sprites for he was a real demon.One day when he was in a merry mood he made a lookingglass which had the power of making everything good or beautiful that was reflected in it shrink almost to nothing while everything that was worthless and bad was magnified so as to look ten times worse than it really was.The most lovely landscapes appeared like boiled spinach and all the people became hideous and looked as if they stood on their heads and had no bodies. Their countenances were so distorted that no one could recognize them and even one freckle on the face appeared to spread over the whole of the nose and mouth. The demon said this was very amusing. When a good or holy thought passed through the mind of any one a wrinkle was seen in the mirror and then how the demon laughed at his cunning invention.All who went to the demons schoolfor he kept a schooltalked everywhere of the wonders they had seen and declared that people could now for the first time see what the world and its inhabitants were really like. They carried the glass about everywhere till at last there was not a land nor a people who had not been looked at through this distorted mirror.They wanted even to fly with it up to heaven to see the angels but the higher they flew the more slippery the glass became and they could scarcely hold it. At last it slipped from their hands fell to the earth and was broken into millions of pieces.But now the lookingglass caused more unhappiness than ever for some of the fragments were not so large as a grain of sand and they flew about the world into every country. And when one of these tiny atoms flew into a persons eye it stuck there unknown to himself and from that moment he viewed everything the wrong way and could see only the worst side of what he looked at for even the smallest fragment retained the same power which had belonged to the whole mirror.Some few persons even got a splinter of the lookingglass in their hearts and this was terrible for their hearts became cold and hard like a lump of ice. A few of the pieces were so large that they could be used as windowpanes it would have been a sad thing indeed to look at our friends through them. Other pieces were made into spectacles and this was dreadful for those who wore them could see nothing either rightly or justly. At all of this the wicked demon laughed till his sides shook to see the mischief he had done. There are still a number of these little fragments of glass floating about in the air and now you shall hear what happened with one of them.Second StoryA LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRLIn a large town full of houses and people there is not room for everybody to have even a little garden. Most people are obliged to content themselves with a few flowers in flowerpots.In one of these large towns lived two poor children who had a garden somewhat larger and better than a few flowerpots. They were not brother and sister but they loved each other almost as much as if they had been. Their parents lived opposite each other in two garrets where the roofs of neighboring houses nearly joined each other and the water pipe ran between them. In each roof was a little window so that any one could step across the gutter from one window to the other.The parents of each of these children had a large wooden box in which they cultivated kitchen vegetables for their own use and in each box was a little rosebush which grew luxuriantly.After a while the parents decided to place these two boxes across the water pipe so that they reached from one window to the other and looked like two banks of flowers. Sweet peas drooped over the boxes and the rosebushes shot forth long branches which were trained about the windows and clustered together almost like a triumphal arch of leaves and flowers.The boxes were very high and the children knew they must not climb upon them without permission but they often had leave to step out and sit upon their little stools under the rosebushes or play quietly together.In winter all this pleasure came to an end for the windows were sometimes quite frozen over. But they would warm copper pennies on the stove and hold the warm pennies against the frozen pane then there would soon be a little round hole through which they could peep and the soft bright eyes of the little boy and girl would sparkle through the hole at each window as they looked at each other. Their names were Kay and Gerda. In summer they could be together with one jump from the window but in winter they had to go up and down the long staircase and out through the snow before they could meet.See there are the white bees swarming said Kays old grandmother one day when it was snowing.Have they a queen bee asked the little boy for he knew that the real bees always had a queen.To be sure they have said the grandmother. She is flying there where the swarm is thickest. She is the largest of them all and never remains on the earth but flies up to the dark clouds. Often at midnight she flies through the streets of the town and breathes with her frosty breath upon the windows then the ice freezes on the panes into wonderful forms that look like flowers and castles.Yes I have seen them said both the children and they knew it must be true.Can the Snow Queen come in here asked the little girl.Only let her come said the boy. Ill put her on the warm stove and then shell melt.The grandmother smoothed his hair and told him more stories.That same evening when little Kay was at home half undressed he climbed upon a chair by the window and peeped out through the little round hole. A few flakes of snow were falling and one of them rather larger than the rest alighted on the edge of one of the flower boxes. Strange to say this snowflake grew larger and larger till at last it took the form of a woman dressed in garments of white gauze which looked like millions of starry snowflakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful but made of iceglittering dazzling ice. Still she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars though there was neither peace nor rest in them. She nodded toward the window and waved her hand. The little boy was frightened and sprang from the chair and at the same moment it seemed as if a large bird flew by the window.On the following day there was a clear frost and very soon came the spring. The sun shone the young green leaves burst forth the swallows built their nests windows were opened and the children sat once more in the garden on the roof high above all the other rooms.How beautifully the roses blossomed this summer The little girl had learned a hymn in which roses were spoken of. She thought of their own roses and she sang the hymn to the little boy and he sang tooRoses bloom and fade awayThe Christchild shall abide alway.Blessed are we his face to seeAnd ever little children be.Then the little ones held each other by the hand and kissed the roses and looked at the bright sunshine and spoke to it as if the Christchild were really there. Those were glorious summer days. How beautiful and fresh it was out among the rosebushes which seemed as if they would never leave off blooming.One day Kay and Gerda sat looking at a book of pictures of animals and birds. Just then as the clock in the church tower struck twelve Kay said Oh something has struck my heart and soon after There is certainly something in my eye.The little girl put her arm round his neck and looked into his eye but she could see nothing.I believe it is gone he said. But it was not gone it was one of those bits of the lookingglassthat magic mirror of which we have spokenthe ugly glass which made everything great and good appear small and ugly while all that was wicked and bad became more visible and every little fault could be plainly seen. Poor little Kay had also received a small splinter in his heart which very quickly turned to a lump of ice. He felt no more pain but the glass was there still. Why do you cry said he at last. It makes you look ugly. There is nothing the matter with me now. Oh fie he cried suddenly that rose is wormeaten and this one is quite crooked. After all they are ugly roses just like the box in which they stand. And then he kicked the boxes with his foot and pulled off the two roses.Why Kay what are you doing cried the little girl and then when he saw how grieved she was he tore off another rose and jumped through his own window away from sweet little Gerda.When afterward she brought out the picture book he said It is only fit for babies in long clothes and when grandmother told stories he would interrupt her with but or sometimes when he could manage it he would get behind her chair put on a pair of spectacles and imitate her very cleverly to make the people laugh. By and by he began to mimic the speech and gait of persons in the street. All that was peculiar or disagreeable in a person he would imitate directly and people said That boy will be very clever he has a remarkable genius. But it was the piece of glass in his eye and the coldness in his heart that made him act like this. He would even tease little Gerda who loved him with all her heart.His games too were quite different they were not so childlike. One winters day when it snowed he brought out a burning glass then holding out the skirt of his blue coat let the snowflakes fall upon it.Look in this glass Gerda said he and she saw how every flake of snow was magnified and looked like a beautiful flower or a glittering star.Is it not clever said Kay and much more interesting than looking at real flowers There is not a single fault in it. The snowflakes are quite perfect till they begin to melt.Soon after Kay made his appearance in large thick gloves and with his sledge at his back. He called upstairs to Gerda Ive got leave to go into the great square where the other boys play and ride. And away he went.In the great square the boldest among the boys would often tie their sledges to the wagons of the country people and so get a ride. This was capital. But while they were all amusing themselves and Kay with them a great sledge came by it was painted white and in it sat some one wrapped in a rough white fur and wearing a white cap. The sledge drove twice round the square and Kay fastened his own little sledge to it so that when it went away he went with it. It went faster and faster right through the next street and the person who drove turned round and nodded pleasantly to Kay as if they were well acquainted with each other but whenever Kay wished to loosen his little sledge the driver turned and nodded as if to signify that he was to stay so Kay sat still and they drove out through the town gate.Then the snow began to fall so heavily that the little boy could not see a hands breadth before him but still they drove on. He suddenly loosened the cord so that the large sledge might go on without him but it was of no use his little carriage held fast and away they went like the wind. Then he called out loudly but nobody heard him while the snow beat upon him and the sledge flew onward. Every now and then it gave a jump as if they were going over hedges and ditches. The boy was frightened and tried to say a prayer but he could remember nothing but the multiplication table.The snowflakes became larger and larger till they appeared like great white birds. All at once they sprang on one side the great sledge stopped and the person who had driven it rose up. The fur and the cap which were made entirely of snow fell off and he saw a lady tall and white it was the Snow Queen.We have driven well said she but why do you tremble so Here creep into my warm fur. Then she seated him beside her in the sledge and as she wrapped the fur about him he felt as if he were sinking into a snowdrift.Are you still cold she asked as she kissed him on the forehead. The kiss was colder than ice it went quite through to his heart which was almost a lump of ice already. He felt as if he were going to die but only for a momenthe soon seemed quite well and did not notice the cold all around him.My sledge Dont forget my sledge was his first thought and then he looked and saw that it was bound fast to one of the white birds which flew behind him. The Snow Queen kissed little Kay again and by this time he had forgotten little Gerda his grandmother and all at home.Now you must have no more kisses she said or I should kiss you to death.Kay looked at her. She was so beautiful he could not imagine a more lovely face she did not now seem to be made of ice as when he had seen her through his window and she had nodded to him.In his eyes she was perfect and he did not feel at all afraid. He told her he could do mental arithmetic as far as fractions and that he knew the number of square miles and the number of inhabitants in the country. She smiled and it occurred to him that she thought he did not yet know so very much.He looked around the vast expanse as she flew higher and higher with him upon a black cloud while the storm blew and howled as if it were singing songs of olden time. They flew over woods and lakes over sea and land below them roared the wild wind wolves howled and the snow crackled over them flew the black screaming crows and above all shone the moon clear and brightand so Kay passed through the long long winters night and by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.Third StoryTHE ENCHANTED FLOWER GARDENBut how fared little Gerda in Kays absenceWhat had become of him no one knew nor could any one give the slightest information excepting the boys who said that he had tied his sledge to another very large one which had driven through the street and out at the town gate. No one knew where it went. Many tears were shed for him and little Gerda wept bitterly for a long time. She said she knew he must be dead that he was drowned in the river which flowed close by the school. The long winter days were very dreary. But at last spring came with warm sunshine.Kay is dead and gone said little Gerda.I dont believe it said the sunshine.He is dead and gone she said to the sparrows.We dont believe it they replied and at last little Gerda began to doubt it herself.I will put on my new red shoes she said one morning those that Kay has never seen and then I will go down to the river and ask for him.It was quite early when she kissed her old grandmother who was still asleep then she put on her red shoes and went quite alone out of the town gate toward the river.Is it true that you have taken my little playmate away from me she said to the river. I will give you my red shoes if you will give him back to me.And it seemed as if the waves nodded to her in a strange manner. Then she took off her red shoes which she liked better than anything else and threw them both into the river but they fell near the bank and the little waves carried them back to land just as if the river would not take from her what she loved best because it could not give her back little Kay.But she thought the shoes had not been thrown out far enough. Then she crept into a boat that lay among the reeds and threw the shoes again from the farther end of the boat into the water but it was not fastened and her movement sent it gliding away from the land. When she saw this she hastened to reach the end of the boat but before she could do so it was more than a yard from the bank and drifting away faster than ever.Little Gerda was very much frightened. She began to cry but no one heard her except the sparrows and they could not carry her to land but they flew along by the shore and sang as if to comfort her Here we are Here we areThe boat floated with the stream and little Gerda sat quite still with only her stockings on her feet the red shoes floated after her but she could not reach them because the boat kept so much in advance.The banks on either side of the river were very pretty. There were beautiful flowers old trees sloping fields in which cows and sheep were grazing but not a human being to be seen.Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay thought Gerda and then she became more cheerful and raised her head and looked at the beautiful green banks and so the boat sailed on for hours. At length she came to a large cherry orchard in which stood a small house with strange red and blue windows. It had also a thatched roof and outside were two wooden soldiers that presented arms to her as she sailed past. Gerda called out to them for she thought they were alive but of course they did not answer and as the boat drifted nearer to the shore she saw what they really were.Then Gerda called still louder and there came a very old woman out of the house leaning on a crutch. She wore a large hat to shade her from the sun and on it were painted all sorts of pretty flowers.You poor little child said the old woman how did you manage to come this long long distance into the wide world on such a rapid rolling stream And then the old woman walked into the water seized the boat with her crutch drew it to land and lifted little Gerda out. And Gerda was glad to feel herself again on dry ground although she was rather afraid of the strange old woman.Come and tell me who you are said she and how you came here.Then Gerda told her everything while the old woman shook her head and said Hemhem and when Gerda had finished she asked the old woman if she had not seen little Kay. She told her he had not passed that way but he very likely would come. She told Gerda not to be sorrowful but to taste the cherries and look at the flowers they were better than any picture book for each of them could tell a story. Then she took Gerda by the hand and led her into the little house and closed the door. The windows were very high and as the panes were red blue and yellow the daylight shone through them in all sorts of singular colors. On the table stood some beautiful cherries and Gerda had permission to eat as many as she would. While she was eating them the old woman combed out her long flaxen ringlets with a golden comb and the glossy curls hung down on each side of the little round pleasant face which looked fresh and blooming as a rose.I have long been wishing for a dear little maiden like you said the old woman and now you must stay with me and see how happily we shall live together. And while she went on combing little Gerdas hair the child thought less and less about her adopted brother Kay for the old woman was an enchantress although she was not a wicked witch she conjured only a little for her own amusement and now because she wanted to keep Gerda. Therefore she went into the garden and stretched out her crutch toward all the rose trees beautiful though they were and they immediately sank into the dark earth so that no one could tell where they had once stood. The old woman was afraid that if little Gerda saw roses she would think of those at home and then remember little Kay and run away.Then she took Gerda into the flower garden. How fragrant and beautiful it was Every flower that could be thought of for every season of the year was here in full bloom no picture book could have more beautiful colors. Gerda jumped for joy and played till the sun went down behind the tall cherry trees then she slept in an elegant bed with red silk pillows embroidered with colored violets and she dreamed as pleasantly as a queen on her wedding day.The next day and for many days after Gerda played with the flowers in the warm sunshine. She knew every flower and yet although there were so many of them it seemed as if one were missing but what it was she could not tell. One day however as she sat looking at the old womans hat with the painted flowers on it she saw that the prettiest of them all was a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made all the roses sink into the earth. But it is difficult to keep the thoughts together in everything and one little mistake upsets all our arrangements.What are there no roses here cried Gerda and she ran out into the garden and examined all the beds and searched and searched. There was not one to be found. Then she sat down and wept and her tears fell just on the place where one of the rose trees had sunk down. The warm tears moistened the earth and the rose tree sprouted up at once as blooming as when it had sunk and Gerda embraced it and kissed the roses and thought of the beautiful roses at home and with them of little Kay.Oh how I have been detained said the little maiden. I wanted to seek for little Kay. Do you know where he is she asked the roses do you think he is deadAnd the roses answered No he is not dead. We have been in the ground where all the dead lie but Kay is not there.Thank you said little Gerda and then she went to the other flowers and looked into their little cups and asked Do you know where little Kay is But each flower as it stood in the sunshine dreamed only of its own little fairy tale or history. Not one knew anything of Kay. Gerda heard many stories from the flowers as she asked them one after another about him.And then she ran to the other end of the garden. The door was fastened but she pressed against the rusty latch and it gave way. The door sprang open and little Gerda ran out with bare feet into the wide world. She looked back three times but no one seemed to be following her. At last she could run no longer so she sat down to rest on a great stone and when she looked around she saw that the summer was over and autumn very far advanced. She had known nothing of this in the beautiful garden where the sun shone and the flowers grew all the year round.Oh how I have wasted my time said little Gerda. It is autumn I must not rest any longer and she rose to go on. But her little feet were wounded and sore and everything around her looked cold and bleak. The long willow leaves were quite yellow the dewdrops fell like water leaf after leaf dropped from the trees the sloe thorn alone still bore fruit but the sloes were sour and set the teeth on edge. Oh how dark and weary the whole world appearedFourth StoryTHE PRINCE AND PRINCESSGerda was obliged to rest again and just opposite the place where she sat she saw a great crow come hopping toward her across the snow. He stood looking at her for some time and then he wagged his head and said Caw caw good day good day. He pronounced the words as plainly as he could because he meant to be kind to the little girl and then he asked her where she was going all alone in the wide world.The word alone Gerda understood very well and felt how much it expressed. So she told the crow the whole story of her life and adventures and asked him if he had seen little Kay.The crow nodded his head very gravely and said Perhaps I haveit may be.No Do you really think you have cried little Gerda and she kissed the crow and hugged him almost to death with joy.Gently gently said the crow. I believe I know. I think it may be little Kay but he has certainly forgotten you by this time for the princess.Does he live with a princess asked Gerda.Yes listen replied the crow but it is so difficult to speak your language. If you understand the crows language then I can explain it better. Do youNo I have never learned it said Gerda but my grandmother understands it and used to speak it to me. I wish I had learned it.It does not matter answered the crow. I will explain as well as I can although it will be very badly done and he told her what he had heard.In this kingdom where we now are said he there lives a princess who is so wonderfully clever that she has read all the newspapers in the worldand forgotten them too although she is so clever.A short time ago as she was sitting on her throne which people say is not such an agreeable seat as is often supposed she began to sing a song which commences with these wordsWhy should I not be marriedWhy not indeed said she and so she determined to marry if she could find a husband who knew what to say when he was spoken to and not one who could only look grand for that was so tiresome. She assembled all her court ladies at the beat of the drum and when they heard of her intentions they were very much pleased.We are so glad to hear of it said they. We were talking about it ourselves the other day.You may believe that every word I tell you is true said the crow for I have a tame sweetheart who hops freely about the palace and she told me all this.Of course his sweetheart was a crow for birds of a feather flock together and one crow always chooses another crow.Newspapers were published immediately with a border of hearts and the initials of the princess among them. They gave notice that every young man who was handsome was free to visit the castle and speak with the princess and those who could reply loud enough to be heard when spoken to were to make themselves quite at home at the palace and the one who spoke best would be chosen as a husband for the princess.Yes yes you may believe me. It is all as true as I sit here said the crow.The people came in crowds. There was a great deal of crushing and running about but no one succeeded either on the first or the second day. They could all speak very well while they were outside in the streets but when they entered the palace gates and saw the guards in silver uniforms and the footmen in their golden livery on the staircase and the great halls lighted up they became quite confused. And when they stood before the throne on which the princess sat they could do nothing but repeat the last words she had said and she had no particular wish to hear her own words over again. It was just as if they had all taken something to make them sleepy while they were in the palace for they did not recover themselves nor speak till they got back again into the street. There was a long procession of them reaching from the town gate to the palace.I went myself to see them said the crow. They were hungry and thirsty for at the palace they did not even get a glass of water. Some of the wisest had taken a few slices of bread and butter with them but they did not share it with their neighbors they thought if the others went in to the princess looking hungry there would be a better chance for themselves.But Kay tell me about little Kay said Gerda. Was he among the crowdStop a bit we are just coming to him. It was on the third day that there came marching cheerfully along to the palace a little personage without horses or carriage his eyes sparkling like yours. He had beautiful long hair but his clothes were very poor.That was Kay said Gerda joyfully. Oh then I have found him and she clapped her hands.He had a little knapsack on his back added the crow.No it must have been his sledge said Gerda for he went away with it.It may have been so said the crow I did not look at it very closely. But I know from my tame sweetheart that he passed through the palace gates saw the guards in their silver uniform and the servants in their liveries of gold on the stairs but was not in the least embarrassed.It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs he said. I prefer to go in.The rooms were blazing with light councilors and ambassadors walked about with bare feet carrying golden vessels it was enough to make any one feel serious. His boots creaked loudly as he walked and yet he was not at all uneasy.It must be Kay said Gerda I know he had new boots on. I heard them creak in grandmothers room.They really did creak said the crow yet he went boldly up to the princess herself who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel. And all the ladies of the court were present with their maids and all the cavaliers with their servants and each of the maids had another maid to wait upon her and the cavaliers servants had their own servants as well as each a page. They all stood in circles round the princess and the nearer they stood to the door the prouder they looked. The servants pages who always wore slippers could hardly be looked at they held themselves up so proudly by the door.It must be quite awful said little Gerda but did Kay win the princessIf I had not been a crow said he I would have married her myself although I am engaged. He spoke as well as I do when I speak the crows language. I heard this from my tame sweetheart. He was quite free and agreeable and said he had not come to woo the princess but to hear her wisdom. And he was as pleased with her as she was with him.Oh certainly that was Kay said Gerda he was so clever he could work mental arithmetic and fractions. Oh will you take me to the palaceIt is very easy to ask that replied the crow but how are we to manage it However I will speak about it to my tame sweetheart and ask her advice for I must tell you it will be very difficult to gain permission for a little girl like you to enter the palace.Oh yes but I shall gain permission easily said Gerda for when Kay hears that I am here he will come out and fetch me in immediately.Wait for me here by the palings said the crow wagging his head as he flew away.It was late in the evening before the crow returned. Caw caw he said she sends you greeting and here is a little roll which she took from the kitchen for you. There is plenty of bread there and she thinks you must be hungry. It is not possible for you to enter the palace by the front entrance. The guards in silver uniform and the servants in gold livery would not allow it. But do not cry we will manage to get you in. My sweetheart knows a little back staircase that leads to the sleeping apartments and she knows where to find the key.Then they went into the garden through the great avenue where the leaves were falling one after another and they could see the lights in the palace being put out in the same manner. And the crow led little Gerda to a back door which stood ajar. Oh how her heart beat with anxiety and longing it was as if she were going to do something wrong and yet she only wanted to know where little Kay was.It must be he she thought with those clear eyes and that long hair.She could fancy she saw him smiling at her as he used to at home when they sat among the roses. He would certainly be glad to see her and to hear what a long distance she had come for his sake and to know how sorry they had all been at home because he did not come back. Oh what joy and yet what fear she feltThey were now on the stairs and in a small closet at the top a lamp was burning. In the middle of the floor stood the tame crow turning her head from side to side and gazing at Gerda who curtsied as her grandmother had taught her to do.My betrothed has spoken so very highly of you my little lady said the tame crow. Your story is very touching. If you will take the lamp I will walk before you. We will go straight along this way then we shall meet no one.I feel as if somebody were behind us said Gerda as something rushed by her like a shadow on the wall and then it seemed to her that horses with flying manes and thin legs hunters ladies and gentlemen on horseback glided by her like shadows.They are only dreams said the crow they are coming to carry the thoughts of the great people out hunting. All the better for if their thoughts are out hunting we shall be able to look at them in their beds more safely. I hope that when you rise to honor and favor you will show a grateful heart.You may be quite sure of that said the crow from the forest.They now came into the first hall the walls of which were hung with rosecolored satin embroidered with artificial flowers. Here the dreams again flitted by them but so quickly that Gerda could not distinguish the royal persons. Each hall appeared more splendid than the last. It was enough to bewilder one. At length they reached a bedroom. The ceiling was like a great palm tree with glass leaves of the most costly crystal and over the center of the floor two beds each resembling a lily hung from a stem of gold. One in which the princess lay was white the other was red. And in this Gerda had to seek for little Kay.She pushed one of the red leaves aside and saw a little brown neck. Oh that must be Kay She called his name loudly and held the lamp over him. The dreams rushed back into the room on horseback. He woke and turned his head roundit was not little Kay The prince was only like him still he was young and pretty. Out of her whitelily bed peeped the princess and asked what was the matter. Little Gerda wept and told her story and all that the crows had done to help her.You poor child said the prince and princess then they praised the crows and said they were not angry with them for what they had done but that it must not happen again and that this time they should be rewarded.Would you like to have your freedom asked the princess or would you prefer to be raised to the position of court crows with all that is left in the kitchen for yourselvesThen both the crows bowed and begged to have a fixed appointment for they thought of their old age and it would be so comfortable they said to feel that they had made provision for it.And then the prince got out of his bed and gave it up to Gerdahe could not do moreand she lay down. She folded her little hands and thought How good everybody is to me both men and animals then she closed her eyes and fell into a sweet sleep. All the dreams came flying back again to her looking like angels now and one of them drew a little sledge on which sat Kay who nodded to her. But all this was only a dream. It vanished as soon as she awoke.The following day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet and invited to stay at the palace for a few days and enjoy herself but she only begged for a pair of boots and a little carriage and a horse to draw it so that she might go out into the wide world to seek for Kay.And she obtained not only boots but a muff and was neatly dressed and when she was ready to go there at the door she found a coach made of pure gold with the coat of arms of the prince and princess shining upon it like a star and the coachman footman and outriders all wearing golden crowns upon their heads. The prince and princess themselves helped her into the coach and wished her success.The forest crow who was now married accompanied her for the first three miles he sat by Gerdas side as he could not bear riding backwards. The tame crow stood in the doorway flapping her wings. She could not go with them because she had been suffering from headache ever since the new appointment no doubt from overeating. The coach was well stored with sweet cakes and under the seat were fruit and gingerbread nuts.Farewell farewell cried the prince and princess and little Gerda wept and the crow wept and then after a few miles the crow also said farewell and this parting was even more sad. However he flew to a tree and stood flapping his black wings as long as he could see the coach which glittered like a sunbeam.Fifth StoryTHE LITTLE ROBBER GIRLThe coach drove on through a thick forest where it lighted up the way like a torch and dazzled the eyes of some robbers who could not bear to let it pass them unmolested.It is gold it is gold cried they rushing forward and seizing the horses. Then they struck dead the little jockeys the coachman and the footman and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.She is plump and pretty. She has been fed with the kernels of nuts said the old robber woman who had a long beard and eyebrows that hung over her eyes. She is as good as a fatted lamb how nice she will taste and as she said this she drew forth a shining knife that glittered horribly. Oh screamed the old woman at the same moment for her own daughter who held her back had bitten her in the ear. You naughty girl said the mother and now she had not time to kill Gerda.She shall play with me said the little robber girl. She shall give me her muff and her pretty dress and sleep with me in my bed. And then she bit her mother again and all the robbers laughed.I will have a ride in the coach said the little robber girl and she would have her own way for she was selfwilled and obstinate.She and Gerda seated themselves in the coach and drove away over stumps and stones into the depths of the forest. The little robber girl was about the same size as Gerda but stronger she had broader shoulders and a darker skin her eyes were quite black and she had a mournful look. She clasped little Gerda round the waist and saidThey shall not kill you as long as you dont make me vexed with you. I suppose you are a princess.No said Gerda and then she told her all her history and how fond she was of little Kay.The robber girl looked earnestly at her nodded her head slightly and said They shant kill you even if I do get angry with you for I will do it myself. And then she wiped Gerdas eyes and put her own hands into the beautiful muff which was so soft and warm.The coach stopped in the courtyard of a robbers castle the walls of which were full of cracks from top to bottom. Ravens and crows flew in and out of the holes and crevices while great bulldogs each of which looked as if it could swallow a man were jumping about but they were not allowed to bark.In the large old smoky hall a bright fire was burning on the stone floor. There was no chimney so the smoke went up to the ceiling and found a way out for itself. Soup was boiling in a large cauldron and hares and rabbits were roasting on the spit.You shall sleep with me and all my little animals tonight said the robber girl after they had had something to eat and drink. So she took Gerda to a corner of the hall where some straw and carpets were laid down. Above them on laths and perches were more than a hundred pigeons that all seemed to be asleep although they moved slightly when the two little girls came near them. These all belong to me said the robber girl and she seized the nearest to her held it by the feet and shook it till it flapped its wings. Kiss it cried she flapping it in Gerdas face.There sit the wood pigeons continued she pointing to a number of laths and a cage which had been fixed into the walls near one of the openings. Both rascals would fly away directly if they were not closely locked up. And here is my old sweetheart Ba and she dragged out a reindeer by the horn he wore a bright copper ring round his neck and was tethered to the spot. We are obliged to hold him tight too else he would run away from us also. I tickle his neck every evening with my sharp knife which frightens him very much. And the robber girl drew a long knife from a chink in the wall and let it slide gently over the reindeers neck. The poor animal began to kick and the little robber girl laughed and pulled down Gerda into bed with her.Will you have that knife with you while you are asleep asked Gerda looking at it in great fright.I always sleep with the knife by me said the robber girl. No one knows what may happen. But now tell me again all about little Kay and why you went out into the world.Then Gerda repeated her story over again while the wood pigeons in the cage over her cooed and the other pigeons slept. The little robber girl put one arm across Gerdas neck and held the knife in the other and was soon fast asleep and snoring. But Gerda could not close her eyes at all she knew not whether she was to live or to die. The robbers sat round the fire singing and drinking. It was a terrible sight for a little girl to witness.Then the wood pigeons said Coo coo we have seen little Kay. A white fowl carried his sledge and he sat in the carriage of the Snow Queen which drove through the wood while we were lying in our nest. She blew upon us and all the young ones died excepting us two. Coo coo.What are you saying up there cried Gerda. Where was the Snow Queen going Do you know anything about itShe was most likely traveling to Lapland where there is always snow and ice. Ask the reindeer that is fastened up there with a rope.Yes there is always snow and ice said the reindeer and it is a glorious place you can leap and run about freely on the sparkling icy plains. The Snow Queen has her summer tent there but her strong castle is at the North Pole on an island called Spitzbergen.O Kay little Kay sighed Gerda.Lie still said the robber girl or you shall feel my knife.In the morning Gerda told her all that the wood pigeons had said and the little robber girl looked quite serious and nodded her head and said That is all talk that is all talk. Do you know where Lapland is she asked the reindeer.Who should know better than I do said the animal while his eyes sparkled. I was born and brought up there and used to run about the snowcovered plains.Now listen said the robber girl all our men are gone away only mother is here and here she will stay but at noon she always drinks out of a great bottle and afterwards sleeps for a little while and then Ill do something for you. She jumped out of bed clasped her mother round the neck and pulled her by the beard crying My own little nanny goat good morning And her mother pinched her nose till it was quite red yet she did it all for love.When the mother had gone to sleep the little robber maiden went to the reindeer and said I should like very much to tickle your neck a few times more with my knife for it makes you look so funny but never mindI will untie your cord and set you free so that you may run away to Lapland but you must make good use of your legs and carry this little maiden to the castle of the Snow Queen where her playfellow is. You have heard what she told me for she spoke loud enough and you were listening.The reindeer jumped for joy and the little robber girl lifted Gerda on his back and had the forethought to tie her on and even to give her her own little cushion to sit upon.Here are your fur boots for you said she for it will be very cold but I must keep the muff it is so pretty. However you shall not be frozen for the want of it here are my mothers large warm mittens they will reach up to your elbows. Let me put them on. There now your hands look just like my mothers.But Gerda wept for joy.I dont like to see you fret said the little robber girl. You ought to look quite happy now. And here are two loaves and a ham so that you need not starve.These were fastened upon the reindeer and then the little robber maiden opened the door coaxed in all the great dogs cut the string with which the reindeer was fastened with her sharp knife and said Now run but mind you take good care of the little girl. And Gerda stretched out her hand with the great mitten on it toward the little robber girl and said Farewell and away flew the reindeer over stumps and stones through the great forest over marshes and plains as quickly as he could. The wolves howled and the ravens screamed while up in the sky quivered red lights like flames of fire. There are my old northern lights said the reindeer see how they flash And he ran on day and night still faster and faster but the loaves and the ham were all eaten by the time they reached Lapland.Sixth StoryTHE LAPLAND WOMAN AND THE FINLAND WOMANThey stopped at a little hut it was very mean looking. The roof sloped nearly down to the ground and the door was so low that the family had to creep in on their hands and knees when they went in and out. There was no one at home but an old Lapland woman who was dressing fish by the light of a trainoil lamp.The reindeer told her all about Gerdas story after having first told his own which seemed to him the most important. But Gerda was so pinched with the cold that she could not speak.Oh you poor things said the Lapland woman you have a long way to go yet. You must travel more than a hundred miles farther to Finland. The Snow Queen lives there now and she burns Bengal lights every evening. I will write a few words on a dried stockfish for I have no paper and you can take it from me to the Finland woman who lives there. She can give you better information than I can.So when Gerda was warmed and had taken something to eat and drink the woman wrote a few words on the dried fish and told Gerda to take great care of it. Then she tied her again on the back of the reindeer and he sprang high into the air and set off at full speed. Flash flash went the beautiful blue northern lights the whole night long.And at length they reached Finland and knocked at the chimney of the Finland womans hut for it had no door above the ground. They crept in but it was so terribly hot inside that the woman wore scarcely any clothes. She was small and very dirty looking. She loosened little Gerdas dress and took off the fur boots and the mittens or Gerda would have been unable to bear the heat and then she placed a piece of ice on the reindeers head and read what was written on the dried fish. After she had read it three times she knew it by heart so she popped the fish into the soup saucepan as she knew it was good to eat and she never wasted anything.The reindeer told his own story first and then little Gerdas and the Finlander twinkled with her clever eyes but said nothing.You are so clever said the reindeer I know you can tie all the winds of the world with a piece of twine. If a sailor unties one knot he has a fair wind when he unties the second it blows hard but if the third and fourth are loosened then comes a storm which will root up whole forests. Cannot you give this little maiden something which will make her as strong as twelve men to overcome the Snow QueenThe power of twelve men said the Finland woman. That would be of very little use. But she went to a shelf and took down and unrolled a large skin on which were inscribed wonderful characters and she read till the perspiration ran down from her forehead.But the reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda and Gerda looked at the Finland woman with such tender tearful eyes that her own eyes began to twinkle again. She drew the reindeer into a corner and whispered to him while she laid a fresh piece of ice on his head Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen but he finds everything there so much to his taste and his liking that he believes it is the finest place in the world and this is because he has a piece of broken glass in his heart and a little splinter of glass in his eye. These must be taken out or he will never be a human being again and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.But can you not give little Gerda something to help her to conquer this powerI can give her no greater power than she has already said the woman dont you see how strong that is how men and animals are obliged to serve her and how well she has gotten through the world barefooted as she is She cannot receive any power from me greater than she now has which consists in her own purity and innocence of heart. If she cannot herself obtain access to the Snow Queen and remove the glass fragments from little Kay we can do nothing to help her. Two miles from here the Snow Queens garden begins. You can carry the little girl so far and set her down by the large bush which stands in the snow covered with red berries. Do not stay gossiping but come back here as quickly as you can. Then the Finland woman lifted little Gerda upon the reindeer and he ran away with her as quickly as he could.Oh I have forgotten my boots and my mittens cried little Gerda as soon as she felt the cutting cold but the reindeer dared not stop so he ran on till he reached the bush with the red berries. Here he set Gerda down and he kissed her and the great bright tears trickled over the animals cheeks then he left her and ran back as fast as he could.There stood poor Gerda without shoes without gloves in the midst of cold dreary icebound Finland. She ran forward as quickly as she could when a whole regiment of snowflakes came round her. They did not however fall from the sky which was quite clear and glittered with the northern lights. The snowflakes ran along the ground and the nearer they came to her the larger they appeared. Gerda remembered how large and beautiful they looked through the burning glass. But these were really larger and much more terrible for they were alive and were the guards of the Snow Queen and had the strangest shapes. Some were like great porcupines others like twisted serpents with their heads stretching out and some few were like little fat bears with their hair bristled but all were dazzlingly white and all were living snowflakes.Little Gerda repeated the Lords Prayer and the cold was so great that she could see her own breath come out of her mouth like steam as she uttered the words. The steam appeared to increase as she continued her prayer till it took the shape of little angels who grew larger the moment they touched the earth. They all wore helmets on their heads and carried spears and shields. Their number continued to increase more and more and by the time Gerda had finished her prayers a whole legion stood round her. They thrust their spears into the terrible snowflakes so that they shivered into a hundred pieces and little Gerda could go forward with courage and safety. The angels stroked her hands and feet so that she felt the cold less as she hastened on to the Snow Queens castle.But now we must see what Kay is doing. In truth he thought not of little Gerda and least of all that she could be standing at the front of the palace.Seventh StoryOF THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT LASTThe walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow and the windows and doors of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred rooms in it all as if they had been formed of snow blown together. The largest of them extended for several miles. They were all lighted up by the vivid light of the aurora and were so large and empty so icy cold and glitteringThere were no amusements here not even a little bears ball when the storm might have been the music and the bears could have danced on their hind legs and shown their good manners. There were no pleasant games of snapdragon or touch nor even a gossip over the tea table for the younglady foxes. Empty vast and cold were the halls of the Snow Queen.The flickering flames of the northern lights could be plainly seen whether they rose high or low in the heavens from every part of the castle. In the midst of this empty endless hall of snow was a frozen lake broken on its surface into a thousand forms each piece resembled another because each was in itself perfect as a work of art and in the center of this lake sat the Snow Queen when she was at home. She called the lake The Mirror of Reason and said that it was the best and indeed the only one in the world.Little Kay was quite blue with coldindeed almost blackbut he did not feel it for the Snow Queen had kissed away the icy shiverings and his heart was already a lump of ice. He dragged some sharp flat pieces of ice to and fro and placed them together in all kinds of positions as if he wished to make something out of themjust as we try to form various figures with little tablets of wood which we call a Chinese puzzle. Kays figures were very artistic it was the icy game of reason at which he played and in his eyes the figures were very remarkable and of the highest importance this opinion was owing to the splinter of glass still sticking in his eye. He composed many complete figures forming different words but there was one word he never could manage to form although he wished it very much. It was the word Eternity.The Snow Queen had said to him When you can find out this you shall be your own master and I will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates. But he could not accomplish it.Now I must hasten away to warmer countries said the Snow Queen. I will go and look into the black craters of the tops of the burning mountains Etna and Vesuvius as they are called. I shall make them look white which will be good for them and for the lemons and the grapes. And away flew the Snow Queen leaving little Kay quite alone in the great hall which was so many miles in length. He sat and looked at his pieces of ice and was thinking so deeply and sat so still that any one might have supposed he was frozen.Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through the great door of the castle. Cutting winds were raging around her but she offered up a prayer and the winds sank down as if they were going to sleep. On she went till she came to the large empty hall and caught sight of Kay. She knew him directly she flew to him and threw her arms around his neck and held him fast while she exclaimed Kay dear little Kay I have found you at lastBut he sat quite still stiff and cold.Then little Gerda wept hot tears which fell on his breast and penetrated into his heart and thawed the lump of ice and washed away the little piece of glass which had stuck there. Then he looked at her and she sangRoses bloom and fade awayBut we the Christchild see alway.Then Kay burst into tears. He wept so that the splinter of glass swam out of his eye. Then he recognized Gerda and said joyfully Gerda dear little Gerda where have you been all this time and where have I been And he looked all around him and said How cold it is and how large and empty it all looks and he clung to Gerda and she laughed and wept for joy.It was so pleasing to see them that even the pieces of ice danced and when they were tired and went to lie down they formed themselves into the letters of the word which the Snow Queen had said he must find out before he could be his own master and have the whole world and a pair of new skates.Gerda kissed his cheeks and they became blooming and she kissed his eyes till they shone like her own she kissed his hands and feet and he became quite healthy and cheerful. The Snow Queen might come home now when she pleased for there stood his certainty of freedom in the word she wanted written in shining letters of ice.Then they took each other by the hand and went forth from the great palace of ice. They spoke of the grandmother and of the roses on the roof and as they went on the winds were at rest and the sun burst forth. When they arrived at the bush with red berries there stood the reindeer waiting for them and he had brought another young reindeer with him whose udders were full and the children drank her warm milk and kissed her on the mouth.They carried Kay and Gerda first to the Finland woman where they warmed themselves thoroughly in the hot room and had directions about their journey home. Next they went to the Lapland woman who had made some new clothes for them and put their sleighs in order. Both the reindeer ran by their side and followed them as far as the boundaries of the country where the first green leaves were budding. And here they took leave of the two reindeer and the Lapland woman and all said farewell.Then birds began to twitter and the forest too was full of green young leaves and out of it came a beautiful horse which Gerda remembered for it was one which had drawn the golden coach. A young girl was riding upon it with a shining red cap on her head and pistols in her belt. It was the little robber maiden who had got tired of staying at home she was going first to the north and if that did not suit her she meant to try some other part of the world. She knew Gerda directly and Gerda remembered her it was a joyful meeting.You are a fine fellow to go gadding about in this way said she to little Kay. I should like to know whether you deserve that any one should go to the end of the world to find you.But Gerda patted her cheeks and asked after the prince and princess.They are gone to foreign countries said the robber girl.And the crow asked Gerda.Oh the crow is dead she replied. His tame sweetheart is now a widow and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg. She mourns very pitifully but it is all stuff. But now tell me how you managed to get him back.Then Gerda and Kay told her all about it.Snip snap snurre its all right at last said the robber girl.She took both their hands and promised that if ever she should pass through the town she would call and pay them a visit. And then she rode away into the wide world.But Gerda and Kay went hand in hand toward home and as they advanced spring appeared more lovely with its green verdure and its beautiful flowers. Very soon they recognized the large town where they lived and the tall steeples of the churches in which the sweet bells were ringing a merry peal as they entered it and found their way to their grandmothers door.They went upstairs into the little room where all looked just as it used to do. The old clock was going Tick tick and the hands pointed to the time of day but as they passed through the door into the room they perceived that they were both grown up and become a man and woman. The roses out on the roof were in full bloom and peeped in at the window and there stood the little chairs on which they had sat when children and Kay and Gerda seated themselves each on their own chair and held each other by the hand while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queens palace vanished from their memories like a painful dream.The grandmother sat in Gods bright sunshine and she read aloud from the Bible Except ye become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God. And Kay and Gerda looked into each others eyes and all at once understood the words of the old songRoses bloom and fade awayBut we the Christchild see alway.And they both sat there grown up yet children at heart and it was summerwarm beautiful summer.
There was once on a time a mother who had three daughters the eldest of whom was rude and wicked the second much better although she had her faults but the youngest was a pious good child. The mother was however so strange that it was just the eldest daughter whom she most loved and she could not bear the youngest. On this account she often sent the poor girl out into the great forest in order to get rid of her for she thought she would lose herself and never come back again. But the guardianangel which every good child has did not forsake her but always brought her into the right path again. Once however the guardianangel behaved as if he were not there and the child could not find her way out of the forest again. She walked on constantly until evening came and then she saw a tiny light burning in the distance ran up to it at once and came to a little hut. She knocked the door opened and she came to a second door where she knocked again. An old man who had a snowwhite beard and looked venerable opened it for her and he was no other than St. Joseph. He said quite kindly Come dear child seat thyself on my little chair by the fire and warm thyself I will fetch thee clear water if thou art thirsty but here in the forest I have nothing for thee to eat but a couple of little roots which thou must first scrape and boil.St. Joseph gave her the roots. The girl scraped them clean then she brought a piece of pancake and the bread that her mother had given her to take with her mixed all together in a pan and cooked herself a thick soup. When it was ready St. Joseph said I am so hungry give me some of thy food. The child was quite willing and gave him more than she kept for herself but Gods blessing was with her so that she was satisfied. When they had eaten St. Joseph said Now we will go to bed I have however only one bed lay thyself in it. I will lie on the ground on the straw. No answered she stay in your own bed the straw is soft enough for me. St. Joseph however took the child in his arms and carried her into the little bed and there she said her prayers and fell asleep. Next morning when she awoke she wanted to say good morning to St. Joseph but she did not see him. Then she got up and looked for him but could not find him anywhere at last she perceived behind the door a bag with money so heavy that she could just carry it and on it was written that it was for the child who had slept there that night. On this she took the bag bounded away with it and got safely to her mother and as she gave her mother all the money she could not help being satisfied with her.The next day the second child also took a fancy to go into the forest. Her mother gave her a much larger piece of pancake and bread. It happened with her just as with the first child. In the evening she came to St. Josephs little hut who gave her roots for a thick soup. When it was ready he likewise said to her I am so hungry give me some of thy food. Then the child said You may have your share. Afterwards when St. Joseph offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw she replied No lie down in the bed there is plenty of room for both of us. St. Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the bed and laid himself on the straw.In the morning when the child awoke and looked for St. Joseph he had vanished but behind the door she found a little sack of money that was about as long as a hand and on it was written that it was for the child who had slept there last night. So she took the little bag and ran home with it and took it to her mother but she secretly kept two pieces for herself.The eldest daughter had by this time grown curious and the next morning also insisted on going out into the forest. Her mother gave her pancakes with her as many as she wanted and bread and cheese as well. In the evening she found St. Joseph in his little hut just as the two others had found him. When the soup was ready and St. Joseph said I am so hungry give me some of the food the girl answered Wait until I am satisfied then if there is anything left thou shalt have it. She ate however nearly the whole of it and St. Joseph had to scrape the dish. Afterwards the good old man offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw. She took it without making any opposition laid herself down in the little bed and left the hard straw to the whitehaired man. Next morning when she awoke St. Joseph was not to be found but she did not trouble herself about that. She looked behind the door for a moneybag. She fancied something was lying on the ground but as she could not very well distinguish what it was she stooped down and examined it closely but it remained hanging to her nose and when she got up again she saw to her horror that it was a second nose which was hanging fast to her own. Then she began to scream and howl but that did no good she was forced to see it always on her nose for it stretched out so far. Then she ran out and screamed without stopping till she met St. Joseph at whose feet she fell and begged until out of pity he took the nose off her again and even gave her two farthings. When she got home her mother was standing before the door and asked What hast thou had given to thee Then she lied and said A great bag of money but I have lost it on the way. Lost it cried the mother oh but we will soon find it again and took her by the hand and wanted to seek it with her. At first she began to cry and did not wish to go but at last she went. On the way however so many lizards and snakes broke loose on both of them that they did not know how to save themselves. At last they stung the wicked child to death and they stung the mother in the foot because she had not brought her up better.
No god was allowed to sit on Odins throne but Odin himself. One day when Frey was alone in the palace he sat upon the throne and looked over into Jotunheim. There he saw a maiden come out of a low dark house. As she walked down the pathway the air became clearer and warmer. The earth brightened and grew green. When she went inside and shut the door the light faded and the earth grew black again. Around the low dark house was a wavering wall of fire and within the wall fierce dogs kept watch night and day. When the door was shut and Frey could no longer see the maiden he went away sadly. He could neither eat nor sleep for longing to see her. So sad was he that no one dared ask him his trouble. Skade his mother sent Skirner his faithful friend to find out what ailed him. Frey told Skirner of the beautiful maiden and that he could never be happy unless she came to Asgard. Then Skirner said if he could have Freys horse and sword he would ride through the flame wall kill the watchdogs and bring Gerd to Asgard. Frey gave his horse gladly. Skirner rode through the fire although it roared in his ears and blazed far above his head. When the dogs saw him they set up a fierce howling. But Skirner quieted them with Freys sword. Gerd heard the noise outside and sent a servant to see what it was. The servant said an armed warrior stood at the door. But Gerd knew he must be a god or he could not have passed the flame wall. So she bade the servant bring him in and give him food and drink. As soon as Skirner saw Gerd he took from his pocket eleven of the golden apples of the gods and offered them to her as a present from Frey. But Gerd would not have the apples. Then Skirner offered her the wonderful golden ring made by Sindre. This also she refused. Then Skirner took out a magic wand and waved it over the maiden. As he waved the wand he sang a magic song telling of the warmth and light of Asgard and the beauty and gentleness of Frey. As the maiden listened she became enchanted with the glory of the city of the gods and no longer remembered her own cheerless land. Then Skirner took her behind him on Freys horse and rode back across the rainbow bridge. Frey stood by the gate watching. When he found that Skirner had not only brought Gerd but that he had made her forget her home and love Asgard he was so pleased that he let Skirner keep his sword.
About three hundred years ago Ewen Maclaine of Lochbuy in the island of Mull having been engaged in a quarrel with a neighbouring chief a day was fixed for determining the affair by the sword. Lochbuy before the day arrived consulted a celebrated witch as to the result of the feud. The witch declared that if Lochbuys wife should on the morning of that day give him and his men food unasked he would be victorious but if not the result would be the reverse. This was a disheartening response for the unhappy votary his wife being a noted shrew.The fatal morning arrived and the hour for meeting the enemy approached but there appeared no symptoms of refreshment for Lochbuy and his men. At length the unfortunate man was compelled to ask his wife to supply them with food. She set down before them curds but without spoons. When the husband inquired how they were to eat them she replied they should assume the bills of hens. The men ate the curds as well as they could with their hands but Lochbuy himself ate none. After behaving with the greatest bravery in the bloody conflict which ensued he fell covered with wounds leaving his wife to the execration of the people. She is still known in that district under the appellation of Corrdhu or the Black Crane.But the miseries brought on the luckless Lochbuy by his wife did not end with his life for he died fasting and his ghost is frequently seen to this day riding the very horse on which he was mounted when he was killed. It was a small but very neat and active pony dun or mousecoloured to which the Laird was much attached and on which he had ridden for many years before his death. Its appearance is as accurately described in the island of Mull as any steed is at Newmarket. The prints of its shoes are discerned by connoisseurs and the rattling of its curb is recognised in the darkest night. It is not particular with regard to roads for it goes up hill and down dale with equal velocity. Its hardfated rider still wears the same green cloak which covered him in his last battle and he is particularly distinguished by the small size of his head a peculiarity which we suspect the learned disciples of Spurzheim have never yet had the sagacity to discover as indicative of an extraordinary talent and incomparable perseverance in horsemanship.It is now above three hundred years since Ewenachinvig Anglice Hugh of the Little Head fell in the field of honour but neither the vigour of the horse nor of the rider is yet diminished. His mournful duty has always been to attend the dying moments of every member of his own tribe and to escort the departed spirit on its long and arduous journey. He has been seen in the remotest of the Hebrides and he has found his way to Ireland on these occasions long before steam navigation was invented. About a century ago he took a fancy for a young man of his own race and frequently did him the honour of placing him behind himself on horseback. He entered into conversation with him and foretold many circumstances connected with the fate of his successors which have undoubtedly since come to pass.Many a long winter night have I listened to the feats of Ewenachinvig the faithful and indefatigable guardian of his ancient family in the hour of their last and greatest trial affording an example worthy the imitation of every chiefperhaps not beneath the notice of Glengarry himself.About a dozen years since some symptoms of Ewens decay gave very general alarm to his friends. He accosted one of his own people indeed he never has been known to notice any other and shaking him cordially by the hand he attempted to place him on the saddle behind him but the uncourteous dog declined the honour. Ewen struggled hard but the clown was a great strong clumsy fellow and stuck to the earth with all his might. He candidly acknowledged however that his chief would have prevailed had it not been for a birchtree which stood by and which he got within the fold of his left arm. The contest became very warm indeed and the tree was certainly twisted like an osier as thousands can testify who saw it as well as myself. At length however Ewen lost his seat for the first time and the instant the pony found he was his own master he set off with the fleetness of lightning. Ewen immediately pursued his steed and the wearied rustic sped his way homeward. It was the general opinion that Ewen found considerable difficulty in catching the horse but I am happy to learn that he has been lately seen riding the old mousecoloured pony without the least change in either the horse or the rider. Long may he continue to do soThose who from motives of piety or curiosity have visited the sacred island of Iona must remember to have seen the guide point out the tomb of Ewen with his figure on horseback very elegantly sculptured in altorelievo and many of the above facts are on such occasions related.
There were two brothers living together in a house one of whom did all the work while the other did nothing but idle and eat and drink what was ready at hand. And God gave them prosperity in everythingin cattle in horses in sheep in swine in bees and in everything else. The one that worked one day began to think to himself Why should I work for that lazybones as well It is better that we should separate and that I should work for myself and he do as he likes.So one day he said to his brother Brother it isnt right. I do all the work and you dont help in anything but merely eat and drink whats ready. I have made up my mind that we separate. The other began to dissuade him Dont brother it is good for us to be tenants in common you have everything in your hands both your own and mine and I am content whatever you do. But the first abode by his determination so the second gave way and said to him If it is so take your own course make the division yourself as you know how. Then he divided everything in order and took everything that was his before him. The donothing engaged a herdsman for his cattle a horsekeeper for his horses a shepherd for his sheep a goatherd for his goats a swineherd for his swine a beeman for his bees and said to them I leave all my property in your hands and Gods and began to live at home as before.The first took pains about his property himself as before watched and overlooked but saw no prosperity but all loss. From day to day everything went worse till he became so povertystricken that he hadnt shoes to his feet but went barefoot. Then said he to himself I will go to my brother and see how it is with him. He did so and as he went came to a flock of sheep in a meadow and with the sheep there was no shepherd but a very beautiful damsel was sitting there spinning golden thread. He addressed her God help you and inquired whose the sheep were. She replied The sheep belong to the person to whom I belong. He asked her further To whom do you belong She answered I am your brothers luck. He was put out and said to her And where is my luck The damsel answered him Your luck is far from you. But can I find it inquired he and she repliedYou can go seek for it. When he heard this and saw that his brothers sheep were goodso good that they could not be better he didnt care about going further to see other cattle but went off straight to his brother. When his brother saw him he had compassion on him and began to weep Where have you been so long a time Then seeing him barehead and barefoot he gave him at once a pair of boots and some money. Afterwards when they had enjoyed each others company for some days the visitor rose up to go to his own house. When he got home he took a wallet on his back some bread in it and a staff in his hand and went into the world to look for his luck. As he travelled he came to a large wood and as he went through it he saw a grayhaired old maid asleep under a bush and reached out his staff to give her a push.She barely raised herself up and hardly opening her eyes for the rheum addressed him Thank God that I fell asleep for if I had been awake you wouldnt have obtained even that pair of boots. Then he said to her Who are you that I shouldnt even have obtained this pair of boots She replied I am your luck. When he heard this he began to beat his breast If you are my luck God slay you Who gave you to me She quickly rejoined Fate gave me to you. He then inquired And where is this Fate She answered Go and look for him. And that instant she disappeared. Then the man went on to look for Fate. As he journeyed he came to a village and saw in the village a large farmhouse and in it a large fire and said to himself Here there is surely some merrymaking or festival and went in. When he went in on the fire was a large caldron in which supper was cooking and in front of the fire sat the master of the house. The traveller on going into the house addressed the master GoodeveningThe master replied God give you prosperity and bade him sit down with him and then began to ask him whence he came and whither he was going. He related to him everything how he had been a master how he had become impoverished and how he was now going to Fate to ask him why he was so poor. Then he inquired of the master of the house why he was preparing so large a quantity of food and the master said to him Well my brother I am master here and have enough of everything but I cannot anyhow satisfy my people it is quite as if a dragon were in their stomachs. Youll see when we begin to sup what they will do. When they sat down to sup everybody snatched and grabbed from everybody else and that large caldron of food was empty in no time.After supper a maidservant came in put all the bones in a heap and threw them behind the stove and he began to wonder why the young woman threw the bones behind the stove till all at once out came two old povertystricken spectres as dry as ghosts and began to suck the bones. Then he asked the master of the house Whats this brother behind the stove He replied Those brother are my father and mother just as if they were fettered to this world they will not quit it. The next day at his departure the master of the house said to him Brother remember me too if anywhere you find Fate and ask him what manner of misfortune it is that I cannot satisfy my people and why my father and mother do not die. He promised to ask him the question took leave of him and went on to look for Fate. As on he went he came after a long time to another village and begged at a certain house that they would take him in for a nights lodging. They did so and asked him whither he was going and he told them all in order what it was and how it was. Then they began to say to him In Gods name brother when you get there ask him with regard to us too why our cattle are not productive but the contrary.He promised them to ask Fate the question and the next day went on. As he went he came to a stream of water and began to shout Water water carry me across. The water asked him Whither are you going He told it whither he was going. Then the water carried him across and said to him I pray you brother ask Fate why I have no offspring. He promised the stream to ask the question and then went on. He went on for a long time and at last came to a wood where he found a hermit whom he asked whether he could tell him anything about Fate.The hermit answered Go over the hill yonder and you will come right in front of his abode but when you come into Fates presence do not say a word but do exactly what he does until he questions you himself. The man thanked the hermit and went over the hill. When he came to Fates abode there was something for him to see. It was just as if it were an emperors palace there were menservants and maidservants there everything was in good order and Fate himself was sitting at a golden dinnertable at supper When the man saw this he too sat down to table and began to sup. After supper Fate lay down to sleep and he lay down too. About midnight a terrible noise arose and out of the noise a voice was heard Fate Fate so many souls have been born today assign them what you will. Then Fate arose and opened a chest with money in it and began to throw nothing but ducats behind him saying As to me today so to them for life When on the morrow day dawned that large palace was no more but instead of it a moderatesized house but in it again there was enough of everything.At the approach of evening Fate sat down to supper and he too sat down with him but neither spoke a single word. After supper they lay down to sleep. About midnight a terrible noise began and out of the noise was heard a voice Fate Fate so many souls have been born today assign them what you will. Then Fate arose and opened the moneychest but there were not ducats in it but silver coins with an occasional ducat. Fate began to scatter the coins behind him saying As to me today so to them for life. When on the morrow day dawned that house was no more but instead of it there stood a smaller one. Thus did Fate every night and his house became smaller every morning till finally nothing remained of it but a little cottage. Fate took a mattock and began to dig the man too took a mattock and began to dig and thus they dug all day. When it was eventide Fate took a piece of bread broke off half of it and gave it to him. Thus they supped and after supper lay down to sleep. About midnight again a terrible noise began and out of the noise was heard a voice Fate Fate so many souls have been born today assign them what you will. Then Fate arose opened the chest and began to scatter behind him nothing but bits of rag and here and there a daylabourers wagepenny  shouting As to me today so to them for life.When he arose on the morrow the cottage was transformed into a large palace like that which had been there the first day. Then Fate asked him Why have you come He detailed to him all his distress and said that he had come to ask him why he gave him evil luck. Fate then said to him You saw how the first night I scattered ducats and what took place afterwards. As it was to me the night when anyone was born so will it be to him for life. You were born on an unlucky night you will he poor for life but your brother I was born on a lucky night and he will be lucky for life. But as you have been so resolute and have taken so much trouble I will tell you how you may help yourself. Your brother has a daughter Militza who is lucky just as her father is adopt her and whatever you acquire say that it is all hers.Then he thanked Fate and said to him again In such a village there is a wealthy peasant who has enough of everything but he is unlucky in this that his people can never be satisfied they eat up a caldron full of food at a single meal and even that is too little for them. And this peasants father and mother are as it were fettered to this world they are old and discoloured and dried up like ghosts but cannot die. He begged me Fate when I lodged with him for the night to ask you why that was the case. Then Fate replied All that is because he does not honour his father and mother throwing their food behind the stove but if he puts them in the best place at table and if he gives them the first cup of brandy and the first cup of wine his servants would not eat half so much and his parents souls would be set at liberty. After this he again questioned Fate In such a village when I spent the night in a house the householder complained to me that his cattle were not productive but the contrary and he begged me to ask you why this was the case. Fate replied That is because on the festival of his nameday he slaughters the worst animals but if he slaughtered the best he has his cattle would all become productive.Then he asked him the question about the stream of water Why should it be that that stream of water has no offspring Fate replied Because it has never drowned a human being but dont have any nonsense dont tell it till it carries you across for if you tell it it will immediately drown you. Then he thanked Fate and went home. When he came to the water the water asked him What is the news from Fate He replied Carry me over and then I will tell you. When the water had carried him over he ran on a little and when he had got a little way off turned and shouted to the water Water Water you have never drowned a human being therefore you have no offspring. When the water heard that it overflowed its banks and after him but he ran and barely escaped. When he came to the man whose cattle were unproductive he was impatiently waiting for him. What news brother in Gods name Have you asked Fate the question He replied I have and Fate says when you celebrate the festival of your nameday you slaughter the worst animals but if you slaughter the best you have all your cattle will be productive. When he heard this he said to him Stay brother with us it isnt three days to my nameday and if it is really true I will give you an apple.He stayed till the nameday. When the nameday arrived the householder slaughtered his best ox and from that time forth his cattle became productive. After this the householder presented him with five head of cattle. He thanked him and proceeded on his way. When he came to the village of the householder who had the insatiable servants the householder was impatiently expecting him. How is it brother in Gods name What says Fate He replied Fate says you do not honour your father and mother but throw their food behind the stove for them to eat if you put them in the best place at table and give them the first cup of brandy and the first cup of wine your people will not eat half as much and your father and mother will be content.When the householder heard this he told his wife and she immediately washed and combed her father and mother in law and put nice shoes on their feet and when evening came the householder put them in the best place at table and gave them the first cup of brandy and the first cup of wine. From that time forth the household could not eat half what they did before and on the morrow both the father and the mother departed this life. Then the householder gave him two oxen he thanked him and went home. When he came to his place of abode his acquaintances began to congratulate him and ask him Whose are these cattleHe replied to everybody Brother they are my niece Militzas. When he got home he immediately went off to his brother and began to beg and pray him Give me brother your daughter Militza to be my daughter. You see that I have no one. His brother replied It is good brother Militza is yours. He took Militza and conducted her home and afterwards acquired much but said with regard to everything that it was Militzas. Once he went out into the field to go round some rye the rye was beautiful it could not be better. Thereupon a traveller happened to come up and asked him Whose is this rye He forgot himself and said Mine. The moment he said that the rye caught fire and began to burn. When he saw this he ran after the man Stop brother it is not mine it belongs to Militza my niece. Then the fire in the rye went out and he remained lucky with Militza.
The former magistrate of Quelpart Kim Suik lived inside of the South Gate of Seoul. When he was young it was his habit to study Chinese daily until late at night. Once when feeling hungry he called for his wife to bring him something to eat.The wife replied We have nothing in the house except seven or eight chestnuts. Shall I roast these and bring them to youKim replied Good bring them.The servants were asleep and there was no one on hand to answer a call so the wife went to the kitchen made a fire and cooked them herself. Kim waited meanwhile for her to come.After a little while she brought them in a handbasket cooked and ready served for him. Kim ate and enjoyed them much. Meanwhile she sat before his desk and waited. Suddenly the door opened and another person entered. Kim raised his eyes to see and there was the exact duplicate of his wife with a basket in her hand and roasted chestnuts. As he looked at both of them beneath the light the two women were perfect facsimiles of each other. The two also looked back and forth in alarm saying Whats this thats happened Who are youAt last the cocks crew and the east began to lighten. The one whose right hand he held said Why do you hold me so It hurts let me go. She shook and tugged but Kim held all the tighter. In a little after struggling she fell to the floor and suddenly changed into a wild cat. Kim in fear and surprise let her go and she made her escape through the door. What a pity that he did not make the beast fast for good and all
Once upon a time something wonderful happened. If it hadnt happened it wouldnt be told.There was once a good for nothing fellow who was so poor and needy that he had not even enough to eat to be able to drink water after it. When he had wandered through all the countries in the world he returned home somewhat more sensible. He had passed through many perils abroad knocked his head against the top of the door been sifted through the coarse and the fine sieve. He would now gladly have pursued some trade but he had no money. One day he found three peas. After picking them up from the ground he took them on the palm of his hand looked at them pondered a long time and then said laughing If I plant these seeds in the ground I shall have a hundred in a year if I afterward plant the hundred I shall have thousands and if I put these thousands in the earth I shall reap who knows how many Then if I go on in this way I shall finally become a rich man. But if I could help wealth to come quickerlet me seeHe went to the emperor and begged him to order through the whole empire barrels in which to keep his peas.When the emperor heard that he needed such a quantity of barrels he thought he must be stifling in money and was more and more convinced of it when he entered into conversation with him. What is true must remain true he didnt keep his mouth shut but opened it and bragged till it would have been supposed that real pearls fell from his lips.He told the emperor what he had seen in foreign lands related how things were here and there spoke of this and that till the emperor stood before him with his mouth wide open. When he saw that the emperor marveled at his statements he bragged more and more saying that he had palaces herds and other riches.The sovereign believed the boasters stories and said to himI see that you have traveled know a great deal and are cunning and experienced if you wish I will gladly give you my daughter in marriage.The braggart now regretted having told so many lies for he did not know how to escape the monarchs proposal. After reflecting a short time he plucked up courage and said I will gladly accept the position of soninlaw you offer and will try to show you that I am worthy of it.The necessary preparations were made and after some time an imperial wedding was celebrated in the palace. Then the man remained there.One two several weeks elapsed and no trace of peas and wealth appeared. Finally the emperor began to repent what he had done but there was no help for it and the emperors soninlaw perceived from the manner of the courtiers and nobles that they had very little respect for him.His cheeks burned with shame. He made useless plans tortured himself to find some means of getting out of the scrape and could not even sleep at night. One morning without any ones knowledge he left the palace at dawn walked on till he came to a meadow and wandered along absorbed in thought without knowing where he was going. Suddenly a rosycheeked man stood before him and asked Where are you going gossip you look as sad and thoughtful as if all your ships had sunk in the sea.The emperors soninlaw related his dilemma and what he was seeking and the man repliedIf I deliver you from your difficulty what will you give meWhatever you ask he answered.There are nine of us brothers said the man and each knows a riddle. If you guess them our whole property shall be yours but if not your first child must be ours.The emperors soninlaw utterly crushed with shame agreed hard as it was for him hoping that before the child was born he might find somebody who could tell him what to do.So they set out together that the stranger might show him the herds of cattle he owned and his palaces which were not far off. They also instructed the herdsmen swineherds shepherds and laborers what they were to say if any body asked to whom the flocks and herds belonged.The emperors soninlaw returned to the palace and said that he would take his wife home the next day. On his way back he met an old man in the fields and seeing how aged and feeble he was he pitied him and offered him alms. The old man would accept nothing but asked permission to enter his service telling him that he would be none the worse for it and the other received him. When the emperor heard that his soninlaw wanted to go to his own palace he was so delighted that he commanded every thing to be arranged on a grand scale in order to accompany him with imperial honors.Therefore on the following day the whole court was filled with nobles soldiers and attendants of all kinds. All the directions for the journey had been given by the old man who had taken service with the emperors soninlaw he said that he was the Pea Emperors steward and all praised his energy dignity and industry.The emperor was in high spirits and set out with the empress the Pea Emperor and his bride for his soninlaws possessions. The old servant went before and had every thing in good order. But the poor Pea Emperor was as pale and dejected as if somebody had showered him with boiling water. He was thinking of the riddles and how he could guess them.They drove and drove till they reached the fields. Here was a beautiful meadow beyond it a grove like the Garden of Paradise. When the overseer of the fields saw them he came up cap in hand.To whom do these estates belong my friend asked the emperor.To the Pea Emperor replied the man.The emperor grew fat with joy for he now believed that his soninlaw really was no beggar. They drove on some distance further and met numerous flocks and herds of all sorts of animals the emperor asked one keeper after another to whom they belonged and all replied To the Pea Emperor.But when they reached the palace of the nine dragons the emperor marveled at its magnificence. Every thing was in order. They were received at the gate by a band of musicians who played the most beautiful tunes ever heard. The interior of the palace was adorned with real gems. A magnificent banquet was hastily prepared and they drank the finest wine.After the emperor had wished his soninlaw every happiness he returned to his own home greatly delighted with the riches he had seen. But the Pea Emperor was almost dead with anxiety.Evening came. The old servant said to his masterMaster what you have seen of me since I entered your service must have convinced you of my fidelity. Now I assure you that I can help you still more.Are you telling the truth asked the Pea Emperor.Do not doubt me for an instant master And I ask one thing besides let me spend the night in some corner of the chamber where you are sleeping even if it is behind the door. Moreover I advise you not to answer a single word no matter who calls you by name or how great a noise is made.Be it so said the Pea Emperor. And so it was.After they had lain down and put out the light they heard a dull rumbling noise like an approaching thunder storm. Then a hoarse rough voice saidPea Emperor Pea EmperorWhat do you want replied the old man.Im not calling you it replied Im calling the Pea Emperor.Thats just the same thing replied the old man my master is asleep hes tired.Then the noise of many voices was heard as if people were quarreling Again the first one repeated Pea Emperor Pea EmperorWhat is it the old man answered.What is oneThe moon is one.Is it you masterBurst dragonThen a terrible wailing arose as if all the spirits of evil were abroad and another voice saidWhat is twoTwo eyes in the head see well.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is threeWhere there are three grown daughters in a house beware of putting your head in.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is fourThe cart with four wheels runs well.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is fiveFive fingers on the hand hold well.Is it you masterBurst dragonAgain there was a noise like a thunder storm and the palace shook as if the earth was quaking. And again there was a shout for the Pea Emperor. But the latter became more and more quiet and scarcely ventured to breathe but remained perfectly still. This time too the old servant answered. Another voice askedWhat is sixThe flute with six holes blows well.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is sevenWhere there are seven brothers dont meddle with their affairs.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is eightThe plow with eight oxen furrows the earth well.Is it you masterBurst dragonWhat is nineWhere there are nine grown daughters in a house it is not swept.Is it you masterBurst dragonThe Pea Emperor who heard all this could not sleep all night long even when it grew so still that one might have heard a fly buzz he waited for daylight with the utmost impatience.When he rose the next morning the old servant had vanished. He went out of the palace and what did he behold The scattered corpses of nine dragons which he gave to the ravens. While thanking God for having preserved his life and delivered him from disgrace he heard a sweet voice sayYour compassion for the poor man saved you. Always be charitable.
A party of redwinged blackbirds were frolicking on the ice one winter day. They were laughing skating and singing and having the gayest time.Upon the ice we jump and skate.It crackles under all our weight.Our red shoulders shine and glow.And now together away we go.Ongyessuhru.And across the ice they skated together when they sang ongyessuhru.Mr. Coyote heard their singing so he trotted over to the ice.Let me skate with you Blackbirds he said.Oh no one can skate with us who hasnt red shoulders they answered. You will have to get a sharp stone and cut your shoulders so that the blood will make them red before you can skate with us.So Mr. Coyote took a sharp stone and gashed both of his shoulders until the blood ran out and stained them red.Now I have pretty red shoulders too. Now I can skate with you.Oh no not unless you can sing our song they said.Mr. Coyote tried to sing in his big deep voice and dashed out on the ice beside the blackbirds.The blackbirds flew away. They knew that Mr. Coyote only wanted to catch them to eat them up. And Mr. Coyote was so angry when they flew away that he ran along the ice clawing at the blackbirds shadows until his feet were torn and bleeding and he had to give up the chase.Author Note San Ildefonso Pueblo
One black crow bad luck for me.Two black crows good luck for me.Three black crows a son shall be born in the family.Four black crows a daughter shall be born in the family.Five black crows shall be a funeral in the family.Six black crows if they fly head on a sudden death.Seven black crows with their tails towards you death within sevenyears.There was a young man not so very long ago who had been to sea for years. He was married but had no children. He was one of the most spirited men you ever saw. He used to complain of his dreams. He said All at once last Sunday I was up in the air and I saw the vessel I was in going at great speed making for a mountain and I tried as hard as I could to keep her from the mountain. I dont believe I was asleep at all I could see it so plainly. I went along in the air looking at seven black crows all the time. I got dizzy and the vessel seemed to lower on to the earth. The vessel lowered within a few hundred feet of the earth and I saw what I thought were fairies. I thought I had been there for days in truth it seemed to me I had been up there for three days and that I could hear the fairies with mournful sounds drawing a coffin. I watched and watched and saw seven crows on the coffin. It seemed as if they were going to bury someone. Whilst the coffin was going the seven crows flew up and bursted and the heavens were illuminated more strongly than by the sun. Then I lost sight of the fairies but saw some big giants in white walking about and there was a big throne with a roof to it. And all at once I was in total darkness but I could hear things flapping about flying through the air. Then I saw the moon rising and all the stars and all sorts of objects flying through the air. And one came to me and put his hand upon my shoulder saying Prepare to meet us tomorrow.After that everything went dark again. The first thing I knew I was in a ship steering and the seven black crows were in front of me. I had a great trouble to steer my vessel. And as I went on the vessel struck a steeple and exploded and I awoke. Whereupon I jumped out of bed looking very pale.I left him on the beach at 11.30 after he told me this when he went home. When he got home he could see seven black crows on the house. Other people could see the crows but could not count them. He saw them all perched head on. He went into the house and saidThere is something in these crows Jane see them on the roof.She cried out and ran out and looked but could not see the seven. After that he didnt seem to be himself though there was nothing the matter with him. A week afterwards I went out on the Sunday morning after breakfast and there was a seat on the beach and on it sat this man Johnny and another man.Why Johnny you look very pale I said.Do I he said.Yes indeed you do I replied.Well I dont know I have had such dreams.What will they have been then I asked.That I was in a fullrigged ship with all sails set I was all alone but could see nothing only seven black crows. I counted them but my wife could see nothing but she could hear something.That same day when he went home he said to his wifeAh Jane there is something coming over me and he fell down dead.
The hunters had hunted the wood for so many years that no wild animal was any more to be found in it. You might walk from one end to the other without ever seeing a hare or a deer or a boar or hearing the cooing of the doves in their nest. If they were not dead they had flown elsewhere. Only three creatures remained alive and they had hidden themselves in the thickest part of the forest high up the mountain. These were a greyfurred longtailed tanuki his wife the fox who was one of his own family and their little son.The fox and the tanuki were very clever prudent beasts and they also were skilled in magic and by this means had escaped the fate of their unfortunate friends. If they heard the twang of an arrow or saw the glitter of a spear ever so far off they lay very still and were not to be tempted from their hidingplace if their hunger was ever so great or the game ever so delicious. We are not so foolish as to risk our lives they said to each other proudly. But at length there came a day when in spite of their prudence they seemed likely to die of starvation for no more food was to be had. Something had to be done but they did not know what.Suddenly a bright thought struck the tanuki. I have got a plan he cried joyfully to his wife. I will pretend to be dead and you must change yourself into a man and take me to the village for sale. It will be easy to find a buyer tanukis skins are always wanted then buy some food with the money and come home again. I will manage to escape somehow so do not worry about me.The fox laughed with delight and rubbed her paws together with satisfaction. Well next time I will go she said and you can sell me. And then she changed herself into a man and picking up the stiff body of the tanuki set off towards the village. She found him rather heavy but it would never have done to let him walk through the wood and risk his being seen by somebody.As the tanaki had foretold buyers were many and the fox handed him over to the person who offered the largest price and hurried to get some food with the money. The buyer took the tanuki back to his house and throwing him into a corner went out. Directly the tanaki found he was alone he crept cautiously through a chink of the window thinking as he did so how lucky it was that he was not a fox and was able to climb. Once outside he hid himself in a ditch till it grew dusk and then galloped away into the forest.While the food lasted they were all three as happy as kings but there soon arrived a day when the larder was as empty as ever. It is my turn now to pretend to be dead cried the fox. So the tanuki changed himself into a peasant and started for the village with his wifes body hanging over his shoulder. A buyer was not long in coming forward and while they were making the bargain a wicked thought darted into the tanukis head that if he got rid of the fox there would be more food for him and his son. So as he put the money in his pocket he whispered softly to the buyer that the fox was not really dead and that if he did not take care she might run away from him. The man did not need twice telling. He gave the poor fox a blow on the head which put an end to her and the wicked tanuki went smiling to the nearest shop.In former times he had been very fond of his little son but since he had betrayed his wife he seemed to have changed all in a moment for he would not give him as much as a bite and the poor little fellow would have starved had he not found some nuts and berries to eat and he waited on always hoping that his mother would come back.At length some notion of the truth began to dawn on him but he was careful to let the old tanuki see nothing though in his own mind he turned over plans from morning till night wondering how best he might avenge his mother.One morning as the little tanuki was sitting with his father he remembered with a start that his mother had taught him all she knew of magic and that he could work spells as well as his father or perhaps better. I am as good a wizard as you he said suddenly and a cold chill ran through the tanuki as he heard him though he laughed and pretended to think it a joke. But the little tanaki stuck to his point and at last the father proposed they should have a wager.Change yourself into any shape you like said he and I will undertake to know you. I will go and wait on the bridge which leads over the river to the village and you shall transform yourself into anything you please but I will know you through any disguise. The little tanuki agreed and went down the road which his father had pointed out. But instead of transforming himself into a different shape he just hid himself in a corner of the bridge where he could see without being seen.He had not been there long when his father arrived and took up his place near the middle of the bridge and soon after the king came by followed by a troop of guards and all his court.Ah he thinks that now he has changed himself into a king I shall not know him thought the old tanuki and as the king passed in his splendid carriage borne by his servants he jumped upon it crying I have won my wager you cannot deceive me. But in reality it was he who had deceived himself. The soldiers conceiving that their king was being attacked seized the tanuki by the legs and flung him over into the river and the water closed over him.And the little tanoki saw it all and rejoiced that his mothers death had been avenged. Then he went back to the forest and if he has not found it too lonely he is probably living there still.
One day Giuf  went out to gather herbs and it was night before he returned. On his way back the moon rose through the clouds and Giuf  sat down on a stone and watched the moon appear and disappear behind the clouds and he exclaimed constantly It appears it appears it sets it setsNow there were near the way some thieves who were skinning a calf which they had stolen and when they heard It appears it sets they feared that the officers of justice were coming so they ran away and left the meat. When Giuf  saw the thieves running away he went to see what it was and found the calf skinned. He took his knife and cut off flesh enough to fill his sack and went home. When he arrived there his mother asked him why he came so late. He said it was because he was bringing some meat which she was to sell the next day and the money was to be kept for him. The next day his mother sent him into the country and sold the meat.In the evening Giuf  returned and asked his mother Did you sell the meat Yes I sold it to the flies on credit. When will they give you the money When they get it. A week passed and the flies brought no money so Giuf  went to the judge and said to him Sir I want justice. I sold the flies meat on credit and they have not come to pay me. The judge said I pronounce this sentence on them wherever you see them you may kill them. Just then a fly lighted on the judges nose and Giuf  dealt it such a blow that he broke the judges head.
Once upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a Jute or an Angle or even a Dravidian which he might well have been Best Beloved but never mind why. He was a Primitive and he lived cavily in a Cave and he wore very few clothes and he couldnt read and he couldnt write and he didnt want to and except when he was hungry he was quite happy. His name was Tegumai Bopsulai and that means Manwhodoesnotputhisfootforwardinahurry but we O Best Beloved will call him Tegumai for short. And his wifes name was Teshumai Tewindrow and that means Ladywhoasksaverymanyquestions but we O Best Beloved will call her Teshumai for short. And his little girldaughters name was Taffimai Metallumai and that means Smallpersonwithoutanymannerswhooughttobespanked but Im going to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulais Best Beloved and her own Mummys Best Beloved and she was not spanked half as much as was good for her and they were all three very happy. As soon as Taffy could run about she went everywhere with her Daddy Tegumai and sometimes they would not come home to the Cave till they were hungry and then Teshumai Tewindrow would say Where in the world have you two been to to get so shocking dirty Really my Tegumai youre no better than my Taffy.Now attend and listenOne day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaverswamp to the Wagai river to spear carpfish for dinner and Taffy went too. Tegumais spear was made of wood with sharks teeth at the end and before he had caught any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it down too hard on the bottom of the river. They were miles and miles from home of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag and Tegumai had forgotten to bring any extra spears.Heres a pretty kettle of fish said Tegumai. It will take me half the day to mend this.Theres your big black spear at home said Taffy. Let me run back to the Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.Its too far for your little fat legs said Tegumai. Besides you might fall into the beaverswamp and be drowned. We must make the best of a bad job. He sat down and took out a little leather mendybag full of reindeersinews and strips of leather and lumps of beeswax and resin and began to mend the spear.Taffy sat down too with her toes in the water and her chin in her hand and thought very hard. Then she saidI say Daddy its an awful nuisance that you and I dont know how to write isnt it If we did we could send a message for the new spear.Taffy said Tegumai how often have I told you not to use slang Awful isnt a pretty word but it could be a convenience now you mention it if we could write home.Just then a Strangerman came along the river but he belonged to a far tribe the Tewaras and he did not understand one word of Tegumais language. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy because he had a little girldaughter Of his own at home. Tegumai drew a hank of deersinews from his mendybag and began to mend his spear.Come here said Taffy. Do you know where my Mummy lives And the Strangerman said Um being as you know a Tewara.Silly said Taffy and she stamped her foot because she saw a shoal of very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy couldnt use his spear.Dont bother grownups said Tegumai so busy with his spearmending that he did not turn round.I arent said Taffy. I only want him to do what I want him to do and he wont understand.Then dont bother me said Tegumai and he went on pulling and straining at the deersinews with his mouth full of loose ends. The Strangermana genuine Tewara he wassat down on the grass and Taffy showed him what her Daddy was doing. The Strangerman thought this is a very wonderful child. She stamps her foot at me and she makes faces. She must be the daughter of that noble Chief who is so great that he wont take any notice of me. So he smiled more politely than ever.Now said Taffy I want you to go to my Mummy because your legs are longer than mine and you wont fall into the beaverswamp and ask for Daddys other spearthe one with the black handle that hangs over our fireplace.The Strangerman and he was a Tewara thought This is a very very wonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me but I dont understand a word of what she says. But if I dont do what she wants I greatly fear that that haughty Chief Manwhoturnshisbackoncallers will be angry. He got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a birchtree and gave it to Taffy. He did this Best Beloved to show that his heart was as white as the birchbark and that he meant no harm but Taffy didnt quite understand.Oh said she. Now I see You want my Mummys livingaddress Of course I cant write but I can draw pictures if Ive anything sharp to scratch with. Please lend me the sharks tooth off your necklace.The Strangerman and he was a Tewara didnt say anything So Taffy put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and seed and sharktooth necklace round his neck.The Strangerman and he was a Tewara thought This is a very very very wonderful child. The sharks tooth on my necklace is a magic sharks tooth and I was always told that if anybody touched it without my leave they would immediately swell up or burst but this child doesnt swell up or burst and that important Chief Manwhoattendsstrictlytohisbusiness who has not yet taken any notice of me at all doesnt seem to be afraid that she will swell up or burst. I had better be more polite.So he gave Taffy the sharks tooth and she lay down flat on her tummy with her legs in the air like some people on the drawingroom floor when they want to draw pictures and she said Now Ill draw you some beautiful pictures You can look over my shoulder but you mustnt joggle. First Ill draw Daddy fishing. It isnt very like him but Mummy will know because Ive drawn his spear all broken. Well now Ill draw the other spear that he wants the blackhandled spear. It looks as if it was sticking in Daddys back but thats because the sharks tooth slipped and this piece of bark isnt big enough. Thats the spear I want you to fetch so Ill draw a picture of me myself splaining to you. My hair doesnt stand up like Ive drawn but its easier to draw that way. Now Ill draw you. I think youre very nice really but I cant make you pretty in the picture so you mustnt be fended. Are you fendedThe Strangerman and he was a Tewara smiled. He thought There must be a big battle going to be fought somewhere and this extraordinary child who takes my magic sharks tooth but who does not swell up or burst is telling me to call all the great Chiefs tribe to help him. He is a great Chief or he would have noticed me.Look said Taffy drawing very hard and rather scratchily now Ive drawn you and Ive put the spear that Daddy wants into your hand just to remind you that youre to bring it. Now Ill show you how to find my Mummys livingaddress. You go along till you come to two trees those are trees and then you go over a hill thats a hill and then you come into a beaverswamp all full of beavers. I havent put in all the beavers because I cant draw beavers but Ive drawn their heads and thats all youll see of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you dont fall in Then our Cave is just beyond the beaverswamp. It isnt as high as the hills really but I cant draw things very small. Thats my Mummy outside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest Mummy there ever was but she wont be fended when she sees Ive drawn her so plain. Shell be pleased of me because I can draw. Now in case you forget Ive drawn the spear that Daddy wants outside our Cave. Its inside really but you show the picture to my Mummy and shell give it you. Ive made her holding up her hands because I know shell be so pleased to see you. Isnt it a beautiful picture And do you quite understand or shall I splain againThe Strangerman and he was a Tewara looked at the picture and nodded very hard. He said to himself If I do not fetch this great Chiefs tribe to help him he will be slain by his enemies who are coming up on all sides with spears. Now I see why the great Chief pretended not to notice me He feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and would see him. Therefore he turned to me his back and let the wise and wonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties. I will away and get help for him from his tribe. He did not even ask Taffy the road but raced off into the bushes like the wind with the birchbark in his hand and Taffy sat down most pleased.Now this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for himWhat have you been doing Taffy said Tegumai. He had mended his spear and was carefully waving it to and fro.Its a little berangement of my own Daddy dear said Taffy. If you wont ask me questions youll know all about it in a little time and youll be surprised. You dont know how surprised youll be Daddy Promise youll be surprised.Very well said Tegumai and went on fishing.The Strangermandid you know he was a Tewarahurried away with the picture and ran for some miles till quite by accident he found Teshumai Tewindrow at the door of her Cave talking to some other Neolithic ladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch. Taffy was very like Teshumai especially about the upper part of the face and the eyes so the Strangermanalways a pure Tewarasmiled politely and handed Teshumai the birchbark. He had run hard so that he panted and his legs were scratched with brambles but he still tried to be polite.As soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything and flew at the Strangerman. The other Neolithic ladies at once knocked him down and sat on him in a long line of six while Teshumai pulled his hair.Its as plain as the nose on this Strangermans face she said. He has stuck my Tegumai all full of spears and frightened poor Taffy so that her hair stands all on end and not content with that he brings me a horrid picture of how it was done. Look She showed the picture to all the Neolithic ladies sitting patiently on the Strangerman. Here is my Tegumai with his arm broken here is a spear sticking into his back here is a man with a spear ready to throw here is another man throwing a spear from a Cave and here are a whole pack of people they were Taffys beavers really but they did look rather like people coming up behind Tegumai. Isnt it shockingMost shocking said the Neolithic ladies and they filled the Strangermans hair with mud at which he was surprised and they beat upon the Reverberating Tribal Drums and called together all the chiefs of the Tribe of Tegumai with their Hetmans and Dolmans all Neguses Woons and Akhoonds of the organisation in addition to the Warlocks Angekoks Jujumen Bonzes and the rest who decided that before they chopped the Strangermans head off he should instantly lead them down to the river and show them where he had hidden poor Taffy.By this time the Strangerman in spite of being a Tewara was really annoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud they had rolled him up and down on knobby pebbles they had sat upon him in a long line of six they had thumped him and bumped him till he could hardly breathe and though he did not understand their language he was almost sure that the names the Neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike. However he said nothing till all the Tribe of Tegumai were assembled and then he led them back to the bank of the Wagai river and there they found Taffy making daisychains and Tegumai carefully spearing small carp with his mended spear.Well you have been quick said Taffy. But why did you bring so many people Daddy dear this is my surprise. Are you surprised DaddyVery said Tegumai but it has ruined all my fishing for the day. Why the whole dear kind nice clean quiet Tribe is here Taffy.And so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the Neolithic ladies tightly holding on to the Strangerman whose hair was full of mud although he was a Tewara. Behind them came the Head Chief the ViceChief the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs all armed to the upper teeth the Hetmans and Heads of Hundreds Platoffs with their Platoons and Dolmans with their Detachments Woons Neguses and Akhoonds ranking in the rear still armed to the teeth. Behind them was the Tribe in hierarchical order from owners of four caves one for each season a private reindeerrun and two salmonleaps to feudal and prognathous Villeins semientitled to half a bearskin of winter nights seven yards from the fire and adscript serfs holding the reversion of a scraped marrowbone under heriot Arent those beautiful words Best Beloved. They were all there prancing and shouting and they frightened every fish for twenty miles and Tegumai thanked them in a fluid Neolithic oration.Then Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy very much indeed but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took Tegumai by the topknot feathers and shook him severely.Explain Explain Explain cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.Goodness sakes alive said Tegumai. Let go of my topknot. Cant a man break his carpspear without the whole countryside descending on him Youre a very interfering people.I dont believe youve brought my Daddys blackhandled spear after all said Taffy. And what are you doing to my nice StrangermanThey were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes turned round and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.Where are the bad people who speared you my darling said Teshumai Tewindrow.There werent any said Tegumai. My only visitor this morning was the poor fellow that you are trying to choke. Arent you well or are you ill O Tribe of TegumaiHe came with a horrible picture said the Head Chiefa picture that showed you were full of spears.ErumPraps Id better splain that I gave him that picture said Taffy but she did not feel quite comfy.You said the Tribe of Tegumai all together. Smallpersonwithnomannerswhooughttobespanked YouTaffy dear Im afraid were in for a little trouble said her Daddy and put his arm round her so she didnt care.Explain Explain Explain said the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai and he hopped on one foot.I wanted the Strangerman to fetch Daddys spear so I drawded it said Taffy. There wasnt lots of spears. There was only one spear. I drawded it three times to make sure. I couldnt help it looking as if it stuck into Daddys headthere wasnt room on the birchbark and those things that Mummy called bad people are my beavers. I drawded them to show him the way through the swamp and I drawded Mummy at the mouth of the Cave looking pleased because he is a nice Strangerman and I think you are just the stupidest people in the world said Taffy. He is a very nice man. Why have you filled his hair with mud Wash himNobody said anything at all for a longtime till the Head Chief laughed then the Strangerman who was at least a Tewara laughed then Tegumai laughed till he fell down flat on the bank then all the Tribe laughed more and worse and louder. The only people who did not laugh were Teshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies. They were very polite to all their husbands and said Idiot ever so often.Then the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and sang O Smallpersonwithoutanymannerswhooughttobespanked youve hit upon a great inventionI didnt intend to I only wanted Daddys blackhandled spear said Taffy.Never mind. It is a great invention and some day men will call it writing. At present it is only pictures and as we have seen today pictures are not always properly understood. But a time will come O Babe of Tegumai when we shall make lettersall twentysix of emand when we shall be able to read as well as to write and then we shall always say exactly what we mean without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic ladies wash the mud out of the strangers hair.I shall be glad of that said Taffy because after all though youve brought every single other spear in the Tribe of Tegumai youve forgotten my Daddys blackhandled spear.Then the Head Chief cried and said and sang Taffy dear the next time you write a pictureletter youd better send a man who can talk our language with it to explain what it means. I dont mind it myself because I am a Head Chief but its very bad for the rest of the Tribe of Tegumai and as you can see it surprises the stranger.Then they adopted the Strangerman a genuine Tewara of Tewar into the Tribe of Tegumai because he was a gentleman and did not make a fuss about the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into his hair. But from that day to this and I suppose it is all Taffys fault very few little girls have ever liked learning to read or write. Most of them prefer to draw pictures and play about with their Daddiesjust like Taffy.THERE runs a road by Merrow DownA grassy track today it isAn hour out of Guildford townAbove the river Wey it is.Here when they heard the horsebells ringThe ancient Britons dressed and rodeTo watch the dark Phoenicians bringTheir goods along the Western Road.And here or hereabouts they metTo hold their racial talks and suchTo barter beads for Whitby jetAnd tin for gay shell torques and such.But long and long before that timeWhen bison used to roam on itDid Taffy and her Daddy climbThat down and had their home on it.Then beavers built in Broadstone brookAnd made a swamp where Bramley standsAnd bears from Shere would come and lookFor Taffimai where Shamley stands.The Wey that Taffy called WagaiWas more than six times bigger thenAnd all the Tribe of TegumaiThey cut a noble figure then
Once a very long time ago before aeroplanes emulated eagles and motor cars ran along swifter than the foxes there lived on the outskirts of a great forest an old couple who were poor and childless and lonely.Matteo was the name of this worthy pair and the old man was called Cola and his wife was known as Sapatella. Now Matteo was a forester and because his duties kept him roaming from early morn until late in the evening through the deep dark glades of the forest his wife who had to stay at home and mind the cottage and prepare the meals and never go out not even to see the pictures on Saturday evenings was very lonely indeed and wished more than ever that she had a son so that he could go to the pictures and tell her all about them when he came home.But wishes do not make horses or sons nor even daughters and so this poor old woman had to live a very lonely life indeed which gave her a great deal of time to think and to envyThe old woman who lived in a shoe Who had so many children she didnt know what to do who lived about the same time in another part of the country.One evening when the days were growing short and the nights were correspondingly long and chilly Matteo was on his way back to the cottage when he remembered that Sapatella had asked him to bring home some faggots with him to cook with and to keep them warm because of course when you are a forester and live in a forest you cannot expect to have coal to burn in your grates like those who live in towns and villages.There was plenty of brushwood and heaps of twigs and fallen boughs lying about and as he had his axe with him which all good foresters carry to clear a path for themselves through the dense undergrowths it was not long before Matteo had collected a great bundle of faggots which was just as much as he could carry on his back.But Matteo carried home with him on his back more than a mere bundle of dry boughs and twigs although he did not know it. Neither did Sapatella not until the next morning after Matteo had gone off to his work when she went to the wood pile to get some sticks to put under her pot to boil the nice rabbit which Matteo had shot for her the day before. She picked up a bundle and was about to place it on the fire when a tiny serpent oh ever so tiny slithered and wriggled its way out of the twigs and coiled itself up on the rug.Being a foresters wife Sapatella was not the least bit frightened of serpents or mice or beetles or other dreadful beasts besides it was such a tiny serpent all yellow as can be and when the firelight danced on it it shone bright and gleaming like gold.Ah me said the good woman with a sigh even the serpents have their young ones but I have no one.Then the serpent uncoiled and stretched itself out towards her and spoke. All kinds of animals spoke in those days as you will notice if you read the story through though not so frequently but that the good woman was surprised and startled to hear it.You may have me for your child if you will it said.Keep me warm and feed me wellAnd fortune will upon you dwell.Sapatella was as I have already said considerably startled to hear a baby serpent talk like that but she was a kindhearted woman and very very lonely and she quickly made up her mind to adopt the little serpent and bring it up as her own.The forester her husband who was also kindhearted agreed to let her have her own way in the matter and so the little serpent found a home and care and affection.From that time on peace and contentment and prosperity brightened the little cottage. Everything went smoothly and comfortably though whether the little serpent had really anything to do with it or not I cannot say.Serpents grow up very quickly and what with the warmth and the good food and the affection the little serpent soon grew to be a big one oh monstrous big so that when he lay in front of the fire he took up the whole of the rug and Sapatella had to scold him in order to make room so that she could attend to her cooking.One day when she had nearly tripped over his tail and fallen with a pot of boiling water in her hands Sapatella said to it You are grown too big to be lying about before the fire all day. You must get up and do something.Very well mother said the serpentit always called her mother and Cola it called father just as a son would. Find me a wife and I will get married and settle down.Sapatella did not very well know how to set about finding a wife for a serpent even an adopted one but she agreed to speak to Matteo her husband about the matter when he came home that night.After supper accordingly she put the serpents request to the forester.Our serpent wants to get married Cola she said so you must find him a wife.Very well said Matteo. I will hunt through the forest when I am out and try and find another serpent for him to mate with.Oh that will not do at all said the serpent who had been listening very intently to its adopted parents conversation though it seemed to be sleeping peacefully all over the floor in front of the fire. I do not mate with serpents. You must get the Kings daughter for me. Tomorrow you must set out to the palace and tell the King that I require his daughter in marriage.Naturally Matteo did not at all care about his errand but his wife entreated him to go and so on the morrow the good man set forth the serpent watching him depart from the cottage door chanting all the whileWell Matteo walked along through the forest on his way to the Kings palace and the nearer he got to his journeys end the more difficult and dangerous his errand seemed to grow. He thought the King would be sure to be very angry and he might even order him to be hanged for a knave or beaten off the palace grounds for a fool.But he kept thinking of what the serpent had said and as good fortune dwelling upon us is something we all like to have the forester kept on his way and resolved faithfully to carry out his errand.He came at last to the palace gates and as in those days in that country any one who wanted to could walk in and speak to the King this simple old fellow passed in with the crowd who were going to seek help or justice and in due time he came before the King.O great King he said a serpent who is my adopted son has sent me to ask your daughters hand in marriage.The King stared and then he frowned and then he stared again. Kings are accustomed to receiving strange requests but never anything so strange as this.Fortunately for Cola the King was a goodhumoured easygoing man and thinking that he had to do with some harmless old lunatic he only laughed as did all the courtiers and people who stood about him.Very well he said. I will grant your request only your adopted son must first of all turn all the fruit in my orchard into gold. Then will I give him my daughter in marriage.Matteo thanked the King for his great clemency and kindness in not having him hanged or beaten out of the palace and then started off home again.I am well out of that he thought to himself but my adopted son will have to be contented with a wife of less degree. Who ever heard of turning apples and flowers and cherries into gold Why they can only make copper and silver of them in Covent Garden.But the serpent didnt seem in the least bit concerned when the forester told him the result of his errand.That is a small matter it said. Tomorrow morning you must go into the city with a basket and gather up all the fruitstones you can find and take them and scatter them in the orchard.So Matteo went once more to the town and did exactly as the serpent had told him. Not knowing anything of magic he did not in the least expect anything to happen so you may imagine his surprise when not only the fruit but every tree and leaf and bough in the whole orchard turned into solid gold and glittered so in the sunlight that one could scarcely bear to look at them.It chanced that the King was walking on the terrace with his courtiers when Matteo entered the orchard.There is that silly old man come back again who wants me to wed my daughter to a serpent he said. Is he going to turn my fruit into gold by stealing it and selling it in the marketplaceThe courtiers laughed at this excellent jest as courtiers will but the next moment they stopped laughing and each one rubbed his eyes and ejaculated in astonishment and delight at the marvellous beauty and value of the Kings orchards.The King himself could say nothing and he said nothing until Matteo came before him and humbly begged his Majesty to fulfil his promise now that the serpent his adopted son had done the task assigned to him.The King was in a quandary. He was not greedy or avaricious but to have a serpent for a soninlaw was for a king clearly impossible.Softly he said. You have fulfilled your task it is true but so fair an orchard requires a better setting. Golden trees should not grow out of common ground and be enclosed by common walls. Let your adopted son first turn all the ground and the walls into diamonds and rubies and precious stones so that I may have orchards whereof the like is not known in all the world and then will I give him my daughter to wife.The forester again thanked his Majesty for his great condescension and retired while the King and his courtiers went into the orchard and picked golden apples and plums and peaches from golden boughs and marvelled at the wonderful thing that had been done before their eyes.It was in the Kings mind that this could be no common or forest serpent and he was troubled to think what his position would be if the second task was performed as readily and thoroughly as the first had been.When Matteo reached home and told the serpent what had befallen him the serpent shook his tail and seemed about to fly into a passion.You see how well kings keep their word it said angrily. But it is a small matter after all. Do you go again to the town on the morrow and gather all the broken bits of china and glass you can find. These you must take in a basket and lay a piece on each wall and between each tree and bush.So Matteo set out at daybreak and did exactly as the serpent had told him. He had no difficulty in finding plenty of material for his purpose and it was still early when he reached the orchard with a heavy load of broken teacups and plates and oddments of basins and teapots and waterjugs.Early as it was it was not too early for the King to be present. The wonder of this new possession had kept his Majesty awake nearly all night and he was impatient until he could get into the orchard and satisfy himself that it was all really and actually true.When he saw Matteo approach and lay down his fragments of china he grew thoughtful for he realised that it was all true enough and that the second condition would be likely to be performed. But he said nothing and Matteo walked from tree to tree dropping here a piece of cup there a fragment of plate and wherever the china fell the ground between the trees turned to diamond or sapphire or ruby. With the walls it was just the same. Every kind of precious stone known and unknown was to be found in that wonderful orchard even to a carbuncle which grew on a courtiers toe in consequence of his incautious action in putting his foot just where Matteo was dropping a tiny bit of china.The King was delighted and depressed at the same time. He had got orchards surpassing in beauty and value anything that was known to be in the whole world also he had to give his daughter in marriage to a serpent and the last seemed to the poor King of greater consideration than the former.Tell the serpent your adopted son that although he has accomplished the task I set him yet will I not give him my daughter to wed unless he also turns my palace into gold he said to Matteo and again the forester thanked the King for his great clemency and condescension and returned to his home.Again the serpent grew angry and said shrewd things concerning the value of the word of kings and the trust which is not to be found in princesnot even German princes.But said he it is a small matter. Do you go at daybreak and gather in the forest herbs of this kind and that and make them into a broom and sweep therewith the whole length of the palace walls and so shall it be even as the King wishes.So Matteo went into the forest and gathered herbs of this kind and that and swept the palace well round as the serpent had directed and when the King and his courtiers and the servantseven down to the scullery wencharose the whole palace was golden from the front step of the main entrance to the topmost ridge of the chimney. And it was not gold plate either it was all solid gold of the purest kind.This time the King saw that there was no way of escape when Matteo asked for the fulfilment of the royal promise so he called his daughter to him and told her of the matter.My dear Grannmia he said for that was her name for your sake I have twice broken my royal pledge and now I greatly fear you must keep it. It is a small matterjust to marry a serpent the adopted son of a poor forester.The Princess who was very young and very dutiful and surpassingly fair to look upon agreed cheerfully as though marrying serpents was quite an ordinary everyday duty like laying foundation stones and receiving bouquets.So the King told Matteo to send the serpent along and marry his daughter and for goodness sake not to bother him any further with golden palaces and jewelled orchards and carbuncles on his favourite courtiers big toe.When the serpent heard this from Matteo it seemed beside itself with joy and there and then set off for the palace. But before it left the humble cottage in which it had received so much care and affection it bade farewell to Sapatella and Matteo and thanked them very heartily for all their goodness finishing up with these wordsAnd it did for from that time till the day they died both Sapatella and Matteo were happy and contented and prosperous and never ailed or suffered pain or disappointment.When Grannmia saw her strange lover she alone remained calm and courageous. Illustration by Edmund Dulac published in Edmund Dulacs Fairy Book Fairy Tales of the Allied Nations by Edmund Dulac 1916 George H. Duran Company.When Grannmia saw her strange lover she alone remained calm and courageousthe only one in the palace who did. All the servants ran shrieking when they saw the great golden monster entering the doors and when it got to the presencechamber the King and Queen fled in one direction and the courtiers in another. Only the Princess remained trembling with astonishment and awaited the pleasure of the serpent.Slowly it came gliding towards her and then when it was almost near enough for her to touch it it reared upthe golden skin fell apart and a young and most handsome Prince stood bowing before her.Now of course everything would have been happy and joyous if it had not been for the silly old King who partly out of anxiety for his daughter but chiefly from curiosity stole back and peeped into the room just as the Prince emerged from the golden skin which had disguised him as a serpent.He did just what you should never do with disenchanted princes rushed forward and threw the discarded skin into the fire where it flashed and burned like a resinous torch.At the sound of the crackling the Prince turned and when he saw what had happened he was furiously angry more angry in fact than he had been when as a serpent he had reflected on the unreliability of the promises of kings. Then with a sad look at the Princess he turned to the King and saidAnd turning himself into a dove he circled three times round the Princess and then flew through the window. At least he would have flown through the window only it did not happen to be open. In consequence he broke the pane and very nearly his own head but he got out and flew straight away over the golden orchard while the Princess who had rushed to the window stood gazing after him until he could no longer be seen. Then she turned and gave the unhappy King her views of his meddlesome prying. Then she burst into tears and cried until the sun went down so that the tears formed a stream and ran down into the fountaincourt and all the poor little goldfish died because of too much salt in their fresh water.But crying does not help any one so after all the palace servants had gone to bed she gathered up all her treasures and set out to find her elusive husband who had come to her as a serpent with a wriggly tail and flown away as a dove with a bit of a broken windowpane in his head.When she got out of the palace grounds into the woods behind she met a fox who was also looking for a dove or a fowl or any other winged thing.The fox said Good evening pretty Princess. May I travel with you for companyYes do said the Princess. I am not used to the woods at night and I may not be able to find my way.So the fox led her through the wood and far away from the palace until they had gone miles and miles and the Princess was so tired that she would not go another step not even to find a dove with a bandaged head. So they both lay down and went to sleep.It was late in the morning when she awoke and heard the birds singing all around her.Their song pleased her very much and the fox noticing this remarked Ah if you could only understand what they are saying you would be much more pleased.Oh do tell me dear fox pleaded the Princess and after he had made her ask him a sufficient number of times the fox repliedWell they are saying that the Kings son who was turned into a serpent by his godmother to spite his father has met with an accident that now threatens his life. The spell lasted for seven years and on the very day it ended he was about to marry the daughter of another king when her father rashly burnt the skin and thus caused him to be turned into a dove. In flying from the palace he has cut his head against a windowpane and is now at his fathers palace lying so sadly hurt that none of the doctors can do anything for him.The Princess was greatly concerned at hearing this story.But listen dear fox and hear if the birds say whether there is any way of curing this poor Prince she said.So the fox listened intently and by and by he said to the Princess The blackbirds are saying there is no way but the wrens say there is one. Whoever would cure the Prince must obtain the blood from these very birds and pour it on the head of the Prince when he will immediately recover and be as well as he ever was.The Princess began to grow hopeful and begged of the fox to catch the birds for her so that she might obtain the remedy and restore the Prince to health. She added a promise of reward for his assistance and the fox agreed to help her.So they waited under the trees until the sun had gone in and the birds were all asleep in their nests and then the fox climbed stealthily into the trees and gathered the birds one after the other just like a naughty schoolboy stealing apples from a farmers orchard.Having obtained what she required the Princess set forth eagerly to carry the remedy to the Princes palace.But the fox who had taken care to keep well out of her reach suddenly sat down and began to laugh.Why do you laugh dear fox asked the Princess. Is it that you are overjoyed to think that the Prince who is to be my husband will soon be restored to health But let us hurry we may be too lateNo it is not that said the fox laughing again. It is to think that your remedy will be of no avail without the other ingredient which is the blood of a fox and as I am not minded to supply it I will skip the reward you promised and be off.Thereupon he started away pelting as hard as he could go.The Princess saw that her only hope was to outwit the fox and she immediately thought of a plan to gain her end.Dear fox do not run she said that would be a pity now that the remedy is in our own hands. The King is certain to reward us lavishly and surely there are plenty of other foxes among whom we can find one willing to spare his blood to save the Kings son. Let us go on then and trust to our fortune.The fox proud of the fact of being the most artful animal alive never thought for one moment that he could be exceeded in cunning by a simple maiden so he came back to the Princess and together they walked through the forest to the far end where the palace of the King showed in the near distance.That is the place said the fox but we havent got the other ingredientOh yes we have said the Princess and before the fox could be any more artful she hit him on the head with a stout branch she had picked up and with such force that he did not in the least object to the necessary addition to the Princes medicine being drawn from his own veins.Of course the Princess was sorry to have to do this. The fox had helped her a great deal and besides she was a tenderhearted little thing and she wept like anything all the while she was compounding the remedy but princes are of more importance than foxes particularly when they are handsome princes who have been serpents and are wanted to make handsome husbands.So the Princess took the phial containing the very strange cure for wounded heads and proceeded straight to the Kings palace.They were all so disturbed with the servants running about distractedly and the doctors quarrelling with each other and the courtiers standing about trying not to look bored that no one took the least notice of the Princess but she was a pushing young lady and seeing the palace doors all open she made her way from room to room until at last she found the King himself.And it please your Majesty she said dropping him a curtsy I have come to save the Prince.But how can you save the Prince when all the great doctors in my kingdom cannot demanded the King.chanted the Princess.The King was so overcome with grief and anxiety that he was ready to promise anything to anybody who could help him so he gave the Princess the required promise and without more ado she caused herself to be led into the chamber of the Prince and poured the contents of the phial over his wound.The Prince who had been so nearly at the point of death that no one would have believed to see him that there was any life in him at all immediately sat up recovered and well.He did not recognise the Princess and when the King his father told him the terms on which she had saved his life and presented the maiden to him he refused.For the great service you have rendered me I am grateful indeed he said but I cannot marry you. My heart is already given to another and not even for my life will I be false to my word.When she heard this the Princess was secretly overjoyed but she pretended to be greatly displeased and she disdainfully rejected all other offers of reward that were made to her by the King and the Prince.Tell me who this other is and I will go to her and get her to relinquish you in my favour she said at length. When she learns what I have done for you I am sure she will agree that my claim is greater than hers.It is the Princess Grannmia but that I am sure she will never do said the Prince proudly. Even if she would I will not. What is life without love and I would rather be a serpent again and live in the cottage of a poor forester all my days than rule this kingdom without my beloved Princess.On hearing this the Princess could no longer keep her secret.You must love me indeed dear Prince she said if you do not recognise me when I come pleading to you to carry out your promise after saving your life and marry me as you would have done when the King my father drove you away from me.Then the Prince recognised her and he embraced her so heartily that the Princess wondered whether he was still a serpent or only just a strong young man who was very much in love with her while the King went out and gave immediate orders to set the bells aringing and have preparations made on the most lavish scale for the wedding feast.
Buddhism took its rise in southern India on the island of Ceylon. It was there that the son of a Brahminic king lived who had left his home in his youth and had renounced all wishes and all sensation. With the greatest renunciation of self he did penance so that all living creatures might be saved. In the course of time he gained the hidden knowledge and was called Buddha.In the days of the Emperor Ming Di of the dynasty of the Eastern Hans a golden glow was seen in the West a glow which flashed and shone without interruption.One night the emperor dreamed that he saw a golden saint twenty feet in height barefoot his head shaven and clothed in Indian garb enter his room who said to him I am the saint from the West My gospel must be spread in the EastWhen the ruler awoke he wondered about this dream and sent out messengers to the lands of the West in order to find out what it meant.Thus it was that the gospel of Buddha came to China and continued to gain in influence up to the time of the Tang dynasty. At that time from emperors and kings down to the peasants in the villages the wise and the ignorant alike were filled with reverence for Buddha. But under the last two dynasties his gospel came to be more and more neglected. In these days the Buddhist monks run to the houses of the rich read their sutras and pray for pay. And one hears nothing of the great saints of the days gone by.At the time of the Emperor Tai Dsung of the Tang dynasty it once happened that a great drought reigned in the land so that the emperor and all his officials erected altars everywhere in order to plead for rain.Then the DragonKing of the Eastern Sea talked with the Dragon of the Milky Way and said Today they are praying for rain on earth below. The Lord of the Heavens has granted the prayer of the King of Tang. Tomorrow you must let three inches of rain fallNo I must let only two inches of rain fall said the old dragon.So the two dragons made a wager and the one who lost promised as a punishment to turn into a mud salamander.The following day the Highest Lord suddenly issued an order saying that the Dragon of the Milky Way was to instruct the wind and cloud spirits to send down three inches of rain upon the earth. To contradict this command was out of the question.But the old dragon thought to himself It seems that the DragonKing had a better idea of what was going to happen than I had yet it is altogether too humiliating to have to turn into a mud salamander So he let only two inches of rain fall and reported back to the heavenly court that the command had been carried out.Yet the Emperor Tai Dsung then offered a prayer of thanks to heaven. In it he said The precious fluid was bestowed upon us to the extent of two inches of depth. We beg submissively that more may be sent down so that the parched crops may recoverWhen the Lord of the Heavens read this prayer he was very angry and said The criminal Dragon of the Milky Way has dared diminish the rain which I had ordered. He cannot be suffered to continue his guilty life. So We Dschong who is a general among men on earth shall behead him as an example for all living beings.In the evening the Emperor Tai Dsung had a dream. He saw a giant enter his room who pleaded with hardly restrained tears Save me O Emperor Because of my own accord I diminished the rainfall the Lord of the Heavens in his anger has commanded that We Dschong behead me tomorrow at noon. If you will only prevent We Dschong from falling asleep at that time and pray that I may be saved misfortune once more may pass me byThe emperor promised and the other bowed and left him.The following day the emperor sent for We Dschong. They drank tea together and played chess.Toward noon We Dschong suddenly grew tired and sleepy but he did not dare take his leave. The emperor however since one of his pawns had been taken fixed his gaze for a moment on the chessboard and pondered and before he knew it We Dschong was already snoring with a noise like a distant thunder. The emperor was much frightened and hastily called out to him but he did not awake. Then he had two eunuchs shake him but a long time passed before he could be aroused.How did you come to fall asleep so suddenly asked the emperor.I dreamed replied We Dschong that the Highest God had commanded me to behead the old dragon. I have just hewn off his head and my arm still aches from the exertion.And before he had even finished speaking a dragons head as large as a bushelmeasure suddenly fell down out of the air. The emperor was terribly frightened and rose.I have sinned against the old dragon said he. Then he retired to the inner chambers of his palace and was confused in mind. He remained lying on his couch closed his eyes said not a word and breathed but faintly.Suddenly he saw two persons in purple robes who had a summons in their hands. They spoke to him as follows The old Dragon of the Milky Way has complained against the emperor in the Nether World. We beg that you will have the chariot harnessedInstinctively the emperor followed them and in the courtyard there stood his chariot before the castle ready and waiting. The emperor entered it and off they went flying through the air. In a moment they had reached the city of the dead. When he entered he saw the Lord of the High Mountain sitting in the midst of the city with the ten princes of the Nether World in rows at his right and left. They all rose bowed to him and bade him be seated.Then the Lord of the High Mountain said The old Dragon of the Milky Way has really committed a deed which deserved punishment. Yet Your Majesty has promised to beg the Highest God to spare him which prayer would probably have saved the old dragons life. And that this matter was neglected over the chessboard might well be accounted a mistake. Now the old dragon complains to me without ceasing. When I think of how he has striven to gain sainthood for more than a thousand years and must now fall back into the cycle of transformations I am really depressed. It is for this reason I have called together the princes of the ten pits of the Nether World to find a way out of the difficulty and have invited Your Majesty to come here to discuss the matter. In heaven on earth and in the Nether World only the gospel of Buddha has no limits. Hence when you return to earth great sacrifices should be made to the three and thirty lords of the heavens. Three thousand six hundred holy priests of Buddha must read the sutras in order to deliver the old dragon so that he may rise again to the skies and keep his original form. But the writings and readings of men will not be enough to ensure this. It will be necessary to go to the Western Heavens and thence bring words of truth.This the emperor agreed to and the Lord of the Great Mountain and the ten princes of the Nether World rose and said as they bowed to him We beg that you will now returnSuddenly Tai Dsung opened his eyes again and there he was lying on his imperial couch. Then he made public the fact that he was at fault and had the holiest among the priests of Buddha sent for to fetch the sutras from the Western Heavens. And it was Huan Dschuang the Monk of the Yangtzekiang who in obedience to this order appeared at court.The name of this Huan Dschuang had originally been Tschen. His father had passed the highest examinations during the reign of the preceding emperor and had been intrusted with the office of district mandarin on the Yangtzekiang. He set out with his wife for this new district but when their ship reached the Yellow River it fell in with a band of robbers. Their captain slew the whole retinue threw father Tschen into the river took his wife and the document appointing him mandarin went to the district capital under an assumed name and took charge of it. All the servingmen whom he took along were members of his robberband. Tschens wife however together with her little boy he imprisoned in a tower room. And all the servants who attended her were in the confidence of the robbers.Now below the tower was a little pond and in this pond rose a spring which flowed beneath the walls to the Yellow River. So one day Tschens wife took a little basket of bamboo pasted up the cracks and laid her little boy in the basket. Then she cut her finger wrote down the day and hour of the boys birth on a strip of silk paper with the blood and added that the boy must come and rescue her when he had reached the age of twelve. She placed the strip of silk paper beside the boy in the basket and at night when no one was about she put the basket in the pond. The current carried it away to the Yangtzekiang and once there it drifted on as far as the monastery on the Golden Hill which is an island lying in the middle of the river. There a priest who had come to draw water found it. He fished it out and took it to the monastery.When the abbot saw what had been written in blood he ordered his priests and novices to say nothing about it to any one. And he brought up the boy in the monastery.When the latter had reached the age of five he was taught to read the holy books. The boy was more intelligent than any of his fellowstudents soon grasped the meaning of the sacred writings and entered more and more deeply into their secrets. So he was allowed to take the vows and when his head had been shaven was named The Monk of the Yangtzekiang.By the time he was twelve he was as large and strong as a grown man. The abbot who knew of the duty he still had to perform had him called to a quiet room. There he drew forth the letter written in blood and gave it to him.When the monk had read it he flung himself down on the ground and wept bitterly. Thereupon he thanked the abbot for all that the latter had done for him. He set out for the city in which his mother dwelt ran around the yamen of the mandarin beat upon the wooden fish and cried Deliverance from all suffering Deliverance from all sufferingAfter the robber who had slain his father had slipped into the post he held by false pretences he had taken care to strengthen his position by making powerful friends. He even allowed Tschens wife who had now been a prisoner for some ten years a little more liberty.On that day official business had kept him abroad. The woman was sitting at home and when she heard the wooden fish beaten so insistently before the door and heard the words of deliverance the voice of her heart cried out in her. She sent out the servingmaid to call in the priest. He came in by the back door and when she saw that he resembled his father in every feature she could no longer restrain herself but burst into tears. Then the monk of the Yangtzekiang realized that this was his mother and he took the bloody writing out and gave it to her.She stroked it and said amid sobs My father is a high official who has retired from affairs and dwells in the capital. But I have been unable to write to him because this robber guarded me so closely. So I kept alive as well as I could waiting for you to come. Now hurry to the capital for the sake of your fathers memory and if his honor is made clear then I can die in peace. But you must hasten so that no one finds out about it.The monk then went off quickly. First he went back to his cloister to bid farewell to his abbot and then he set out for Sianfu the capital.Yet by that time his grandfather had already died. But one of his uncles who was known at court was still living. He took soldiers and soon made an end of the robbers. But the monks mother had died in the meantime.From that time on the Monk of the Yangtzekiang lived in a pagoda in Sianfu and was known as Huan Dschuang. When the emperor issued the order calling the priests of Buddha to court he was some twenty years of age. He came into the emperors presence and the latter honored him as a great teacher. Then he set out for India.He was absent for seventeen years. When he returned he brought three collections of books with him and each collection comprised fivehundred and forty rolls of manuscript. With these he once more entered the presence of the emperor. The emperor was overjoyed and with his own hand wrote a preface of the holy teachings in which he recorded all that had happened. Then the great sacrifice was held to deliver the old Dragon of the Milky Way.Note The emperor Tai Dsung is Li Schi Min the Prince of Tang mentioned in No. 65.

Persia was at peace and prosperous but its king KyKoos could never remain at rest. A favourite singer gave him one day an animated account of the beauties of the neighbouring kingdom of Mazenderan its everblooming roses its melodious nightingales its verdant plains its mountains shaded with lofty trees and adorned to their summits with flowers which perfumed the air its clear murmuring rivulets and above all its lovely damsels and valiant warriors.All these were described to the sovereign in such glowing colours that he quite lost his reason and declared he should never be happy till his power extended over a country so favoured by Nature. It was in vain that his wisest ministers and most attached nobles dissuaded him from so hazardous an enterprise as that of invading a region which had besides other defenders a number of Deevs or demons who acting under their renowned chief DeeveSeffeed or the White Demon had hitherto defeated all enemies.KyKoos would not listen to his nobles who in despair sent for old Zl the father of Roostem and prince of Seestan. Zl came and used all his efforts but in vain the monarch was involved in clouds of pride and closed a discussion he had with Zl by exclaiming The Creator of the world is my friend the chief of the Deevs is my prey. This impious boasting satisfied Zl he could do no good and he even refused to become regent of Persia in the absence of KyKoos but promised to aid with his counsel.The king departed to anticipated conquest but the prince of Mazenderan summoned his forces and above all the DeeveSeffeed and his band. They came at his call a great battle ensued in which the Persians were completely defeated. KyKoos was made prisoner and confined in a strong fortress under the guard of a hundred Deevs commanded by Arjeng who was instructed to ask the Persian monarch every morning how he liked the roses nightingales flowers trees verdant meadows shady mountains clear streams beautiful damsels and valiant warriors of Mazenderan.The news of this disaster soon spread over Persia and notwithstanding the disgust of old Zl at the headstrong folly of his monarch he was deeply afflicted at the tale of his misfortune and disgrace. He sent for Roostem to whom he said Go my son and with thy single arm and thy good horse Reksh release our sovereign. Roostem instantly obeyed. There were two roads but he chose the nearest though it was reported to be by far the most difficult and dangerous.Fatigued with his first days journey Roostem lay down to sleep having turned Reksh loose to graze in a neighbouring meadow where he was attacked by a furious lion but this wonderful horse after a short contest struck his antagonist to the ground with a blow from his forehoof and completed the victory by seizing the throat of the royal animal with his teeth. When Roostem awoke he was surprised and enraged. He desired Reksh never again to attempt unaided such an encounter. Hadst thou been slain asked he of the intelligent brute how should I have accomplished my enterpriseAt the second stage Roostem had nearly died of thirst but his prayers to the Almighty were heard. A fawn appeared as if to be his guide and following it he was conducted to a clear fountain where after regaling on the flesh of a wild ass which he had killed with his bow he lay down to sleep. In the middle of the night a monstrous serpent seventy yards in length came out of its hidingplace and made at the hero who was awaked by the neighing of Reksh but the serpent had crept back to its hidingplace and Roostem seeing no danger abused his faithful horse for disturbing his repose. Another attempt of the serpent was defeated in the same way but as the monster had again concealed itself Roostem lost all patience with Reksh whom he threatened to put to death if he again awaked him by any such unseasonable noises. The faithful steed fearing his masters rage but strong in his attachment instead of neighing when the serpent again made his appearance sprang upon it and commenced a furious contest. Roostem hearing the noise started up and joined in the combat. The serpent darted at him but he avoided it and while his noble horse seized their enemy by the back the hero cut off its head with his sword.When the serpent was slain Roostem contemplated its enormous size with amazement and with that piety which always distinguished him returned thanks to the Almighty for his miraculous escape.Next day as Roostem sat by a fountain he saw a beautiful damsel regaling herself with wine. He approached her accepted her invitation to partake of the beverage and clasped her in his arms as if she had been an angel. It happened in the course of their conversation that the Persian hero mentioned the name of the great God he adored. At the sound of that sacred word the fair features and shape of the female changed and she became black ugly and deformed. The astonished Roostem seized her and after binding her hands bid her declare who she was. I am a sorceress was the reply and have been employed by the evil spirit Aharman for thy destruction but save my life and I am powerful to do thee service.I make no compact with the devil or his agents said the hero and cut her in twain. He again poured forth his soul in thanksgiving to God for his deliverance.On his fourth stage Roostem lost his way. While wandering about he came to a clear rivulet on the banks of which he lay down to take some repose having first turned Reksh loose into a field of grain. A gardener who had charge of it came and awoke the hero telling him in an insolent tone that he would soon suffer for his temerity as the field in which his horse was feeding belonged to a pehloovn or warrior called Ould. Roostem always irascible but particularly so when disturbed in his slumbers jumped up tore off the gardeners ears and gave him a blow with his fist that broke his nose and teeth. Take these marks of my temper to your master he said and tell him to come here and he shall have a similar welcome.Ould when informed of what had passed was excited to fury and prepared to assail the Persian hero who expecting him had put on his armour and mounted Reksh. His appearance so dismayed Ould that he dared not venture on the combat till he had summoned his adherents. They all fell upon Roostem at once but the baseborn caitiffs were scattered like chaff before the wind many were slain others fled among whom was their chief. Him Roostem came up with at the fifth stage and having thrown his noose over him took him prisoner. Ould in order to save his life not only gave him full information of the place where his sovereign was confined and of the strength of the DeeveSeffeed but offered to give the hero every aid in the accomplishment of his perilous enterprise. This offer was accepted and he proved a most useful auxiliary.On the sixth day they saw in the distance the city of Mazenderan near which the DeeveSeffeed resided. Two chieftains with numerous attendants met them and one had the audacity to ride up to Roostem and seize him by the belt. That chiefs fury at this insolence was unbounded he disdained however to use his arms against such an enemy but seizing the miscreants head wrenched it from the body and hurled it at his companions who fled in terror and dismay at this terrible proof of the heros prowess.Roostem proceeded after this action with his guide to the castle where the king was confined. The Deevs who guarded it were asleep and KyKoos was found in a solitary cell chained to the ground. He recognised Roostem and bursting into tears pressed his deliverer to his bosom. Roostem immediately began to knock off his chains. The noise occasioned by this awoke the Deevs whose leader BeedrReng advanced to seize Roostem but the appearance and threats of the latter so overawed him that he consented to purchase his own safety by the instant release of the Persian king and all his followers.After this achievement Roostem proceeded to the last and greatest of his labours the attack of the DeeveSeffeed. Ould told him that the Deevs watched and feasted during the night but slept during the heat of the day hating according to our narrator the sunbeams. Roostem as he advanced saw an immense army drawn out he thought it better before he attacked them to refresh himself by some repose. Having laid himself down he soon fell into a sound sleep and at daylight he awoke quite refreshed. As soon as the sun became warm he rushed into the camp. The heavy blows of his mace soon awoke the surprised and slumbering guards of the DeeveSeffeed they collected in myriads hoping to impede his progress but all in vain. The rout became general and none escaped but those who fled from the field of battle.When this army was dispersed Roostem went in search of the DeeveSeffeed who ignorant of the fate of his followers slumbered in the recess of a cavern the entrance to which looked so dark and gloomy that the Persian hero hesitated whether he should advance but the noise of his approach had roused his enemy who came forth clothed in complete armour. His appearance was terrible but Roostem recommending his soul to God struck a desperate blow which separated the leg of the Deev from his body. This would on common occasions have terminated the contest but far different was the result on the present. Irritated to madness by the loss of a limb the monster seized his enemy in his arms and endeavoured to throw him down. The struggle was for some time doubtful but Roostem collecting all his strength by a wondrous effort dashed his foe to the ground and seizing him by one of the horns unsheathed his dagger and stabbed him to the heart. The DeeveSeffeed instantly expired and Roostem on looking round to the entrance of the cavern from whence the moment before he had seen numberless Deevs issuing to the aid of their lord perceived they were all dead. Ould who stood at a prudent distance from the scene of combat now advanced and informed the hero that the lives of all the Deevs depended upon that of their chief. When he was slain the spell which created and preserved this band was broken and they all expired.Roostem found little difficulty after these seven days of toil of danger and of glory in compelling Mazenderan to submit to Persia. The king of the country was slain and Ould was appointed its governor as a reward for his fidelity.The success of his arms had raised KyKoos to the very plenitude of power not only men but Deevs obeyed his mandates. The latter he employed in building palaces of crystal emeralds and rubies till at last they became quite tired of their toil and abject condition. They sought therefore to destroy him and to effect this they consulted with the devil who to forward the object instructed a Deev called Dizjkheem to go to KyKoos and raise in his mind a passion for astronomy and to promise him a nearer view of the celestial bodies than had ever yet been enjoyed by mortal eyes. The Deev fulfilled his commission with such success that the king became quite wild with a desire to attain perfection in this sublime science. The devil then instructed Dizjkheem to train some young vultures to carry a throne upwards this was done by placing spears round the throne on the points of which pieces of flesh were fixed in view of the vultures who were fastened at the bottom. These voracious birds in their efforts to reach the meat raised the throne.Though he mounted rapidly for a short time the vultures became exhausted and finding their efforts to reach the meat hopeless discontinued them this altered the direction and equilibrium of the machine and it tossed to and fro. KyKoos would have been cast headlong and killed had he not clung to it. The vultures not being able to disengage themselves flew an immense way and at last landed the affrighted monarch in one of the woods of China. Armies marched in every direction to discover and release the sovereign who it was believed had again fallen into the hands of Deevs. He was at last found and restored to his capital. Roostem we are told upbraided his folly sayingHave you managed your affairs so well on earth that you must needs try your hand in those of heaven
There once lived in Sianfu an old Buddhist monk who loved to wander in lonely places. In the course of his wanderings he once came to the KukuNor and there he saw a tree which was a thousand feet high and many cords in breadth. It was hollow inside and one could see the sky shining down into it from above.When he had gone on a few miles he saw in the distance a girl in a red coat barefoot and with unbound hair who was running as fast as the wind. In a moment she stood before him.Take pity on me and save my life said she to him.When the monk asked her what was the trouble she replied A man is pursuing me. If you will tell him you have not seen me I will be grateful to you all my life longWith that she ran up to the hollow tree and crawled into it.When the monk had gone a little further he met one who rode an armored steed. He wore a garment of gold a bow was slung across his shoulders and a sword hung at his side. His horse ran with the speed of lightning and covered a couple of miles with every step. Whether it ran in the air or on the ground its speed was the same.Have you seen the girl in the red coat asked the stranger. And when the monk replied that he had seen nothing the other continued Bonze you should not lie This girl is not a human being but a flying ogre. Of flying ogres there are thousands of varieties who bring ruin to people everywhere. I have already slain a countless number of them and have pretty well done away with them. But this one is the worst of all. Last night the Lord of the Heavens gave me a triple command and that is the reason I have hurried down from the skies. There are eight thousand of us under way in all directions to catch this monster. If you do not tell the truth monk then you are sinning against heaven itselfUpon that the monk did not dare deceive him but pointed to the hollow tree. The messenger of the skies dismounted stepped into the tree and looked about him. Then he once more mounted his horse which carried him up the hollow trunk and out at the end of the tree. The monk looked up and could see a small red flame come out of the treetop. It was followed by the messenger of the skies. Both rose up to the clouds and disappeared. After a time there fell a rain of blood. The ogre had probably been hit by an arrow or captured.Afterward the monk told the tale to the scholar who wrote it down.Note This flying ogre is also of the Yakscha tribe.
Long ago a poor widow woman lived down near the iron forge by Enniscorth and she was so poor she had no clothes to put on her son so she used to fix him in the ashhole near the fire and pile the warm ashes about him and according as he grew up she sunk the pit deeper. At last by hook or by crook she got a goatskin and fastened it round his waist and he felt quite grand and took a walk down the street. So says she to him next morning Tom you thief you never done any good yet and you six foot high and age nineteentake that rope and bring me a pile of sticks from the wood.Never say it twice mother says Tomhere goes.When he had it gathered and tied what should come up but a big giant nine foot high and made a lick of a club at him. Well become Tom he jumped aone side and picked up a rampike and the first crack he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod.If you have eer a prayer says Tom nows the time to say it before I make fragments of you.I have no prayers says the giant but if you spare my life Ill give you that club and as long as you keep from sin youll win every battle you ever fight with it.Tom made no bones about letting him off and as soon as he got the club in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the kippeen and says I had great trouble gathering you and run the risk of my life for you the least you can do is to carry me home. And sure enough the wind o the word was all it wanted. It went off through the wood groaning and crackling till it came to the widows door.Well when the sticks were all burned Tom was sent off again to pick more and this time he had to fight with a giant that had two heads on him. Tom had a little more trouble with himthats all and the prayers he said was to give Tom a fife that nobody could help dancing when he was playing it. Begonies he made the big faggot dance home with himself sitting on it. The next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him. He had neither prayers nor catechism no more nor the others and so he gave Tom a bottle of green ointment that wouldnt let you be burned nor scalded nor wounded. And now says he theres no more of us. You may come and gather sticks here till little Lunacy Day in Harvest without giant or fairyman to disturb you.Well now Tom was prouder than ten paycocks and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening but some o the little boys had no more manners than if they were Dublin jackeens and put out their tongues at Toms club and Toms goatskin. He didnt like that at all and it would be mean to give one of them a clout. At last what should come through the town but a kind of a bellman only its a big bugle he had and a huntsmans cap on his head and a kind of a painted shirt. So thishe wasnt a bellman and I dont know what to call himbugleman maybe proclaimed that the King of Dublins daughter was so melancholy that she didnt give a laugh for seven years and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever could make her laugh three times.Thats the very thing for me to try says Tom and so without burning any more daylight he kissed his mother curled his club at the little boys and off he set along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin.At last Tom came to one of the city gates and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him in. Tom stood it all for a little time but at last one of themout of fun as he saiddrove his bayonet half an inch or so into his side. Tom done nothing but take the fellow by the scruff o the neck and the waistband of his corduroys and fling him into the canal. Some run to pull the fellow out and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones and they were soon begging him to stay his hands.So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palaceyard and there was the king and the queen and the princess in a gallery looking at all sorts of wrestling and swordplaying and longdances and mumming all to please the princess but not a smile came over her handsome face.Well they all stopped when they seen the young giant with his boys face and long black hair and his short curly beardfor his poor mother couldnt afford to buy razorsand his great strong arms and bare legs and no covering but the goatskin that reached from his waist to his knees. But an envious wizened bit of a fellow with a red head that wished to be married to the princess and didnt like how she opened her eyes at Tom came forward and asked his business very snappishly.My business says Tom says he is to make the beautiful princessGod bless her laugh three times.Do you see all them merry fellows and skilful swordsmen says the other that could eat you up with a grain of salt and not a mothers soul of em ever got a laugh from her these seven yearsSo the fellows gathered round Tom and the bad man aggravated him till he told them he didnt care a pinch o snuff for the whole bilin of em let em come on six at a time and try what they could do.The king who was too far off to hear what they were saying asked what did the stranger want.He wants says the redheaded fellow to make hares of your best men.Oh says the king if thats the way let one of em turn out and try his mettle.So one stood forward with sword and potlid and made a cut at Tom. He struck the fellows elbow with the club and up over their heads flew the sword and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a thump he got on the helmet. Another took his place and another and another and then half a dozen at once and Tom sent swords helmets shields and bodies rolling over and over and themselves bawling out that they were kilt and disabled and damaged and rubbing their poor elbows and hips and limping away. Tom contrived not to kill any one and the princess was so amused that she let a great sweet laugh out of her that was heard over all the yard.King of Dublin says Tom Ive quarter your daughter.And the king didnt know whether he was glad or sorry and all the blood in the princesss heart run into her cheeks.So there was no more fighting that day and Tom was invited to dine with the royal family. Next day Redhead told Tom of a wolf the size of a yearling heifer that used to be serenading about the walls and eating people and cattle and said what a pleasure it would give the king to have it killed.With all my heart says Tom send a jackeen to show me where he lives and well see how he behaves to a stranger.The princess was not well pleased for Tom looked a different person with fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long curly hair and besides hed got one laugh out of her. However the king gave his consent and in an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking into the palaceyard and Tom a step or two behind with his club on his shoulder just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb.The king and queen and princess were safe up in their gallery but the officers and people of the court that wor padrowling about the great bawn when they saw the big baste coming in gave themselves up and began to make for doors and gates and the wolf licked his chops as if he was saying Wouldnt I enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yezThe king shouted out O Tom with the Goatskin take away that terrible wolf and you must have all my daughter.But Tom didnt mind him a bit. He pulled out his flute and began to play like vengeance and dickens a man or boy in the yard but began shovelling away heel and toe and the wolf himself was obliged to get on his hind legs and dance Tatther Jack Walsh along with the rest. A good deal of the people got inside and shut the doors the way the hairy fellow wouldnt pin them but Tom kept playing and the outsiders kept dancing and shouting and the wolf kept dancing and roaring with the pain his legs were giving him and all the time he had his eyes on Redhead who was shut out along with the rest. Wherever Redhead went the wolf followed and kept one eye on him and the other on Tom to see if he would give him leave to eat him. But Tom shook his head and never stopped the tune and Redhead never stopped dancing and bawling and the wolf dancing and roaring one leg up and the other down and he ready to drop out of his standing from fair tiresomeness.When the princess seen that there was no fear of any one being kilt she was so divarted by the stew that Redhead was in that she gave another great laugh and well become Tom out he cried King of Dublin I have two halves of your daughter.Oh halves or alls says the king put away that divel of a wolf and well see about it.So Tom put his flute in his pocket and says he to the baste that was sittin on his currabingo ready to faint Walk off to your mountain my fine fellow and live like a respectable baste and if ever I find you come within seven miles of any town IllHe said no more but spit in his fist and gave a flourish of his club. It was all the poor divel of a wolf wanted he put his tail between his legs and took to his pumps without looking at man or mortal and neither sun moon or stars ever saw him in sight of Dublin again.At dinner every one laughed but the foxy fellow and sure enough he was laying out how hed settle poor Tom next day.Well to be sure says he King of Dublin you are in luck. Theres the Danes moidhering us to no end. Deuce run to Lusk wid em and if any one can save us from em it is this gentleman with the goatskin. There is a flail hangin on the collarbeam in hell and neither Dane nor devil can stand before it.So says Tom to the king will you let me have the other half of the princess if I bring you the flailNo no says the princess Id rather never be your wife than see you in that danger.But Redhead whispered and nudged Tom about how shabby it would look to reneague the adventure. So he asked which way he was to go and Redhead directed him.Well he travelled and travelled till he came in sight of the walls of hell and bedad before he knocked at the gates he rubbed himself over with the greenish ointment. When he knocked a hundred little imps popped their heads out through the bars and axed him what he wanted.I want to speak to the big divel of all says Tom open the gate.It wasnt long till the gate was thrune open and the Ould Boy receivedTom with bows and scrapes and axed his business.My business isnt much says Tom. I only came for the loan of that flail that I see hanging on the collarbeam for the king of Dublin to give a thrashing to the Danes.Well says the other the Danes is much better customers to me but since you walked so far I wont refuse. Hand that flail says he to a young imp and he winked the faroff eye at the same time. So while some were barring the gates the young devil climbed up and took down the flail that had the handstaff and booltheen both made out of redhot iron. The little vagabond was grinning to think how it would burn the hands o Tom but the dickens a burn it made on him no more nor if it was a good oak sapling.Thankee says Tom. Now would you open the gate for a body and Ill give you no more trouble.Oh tramp says Ould Nick is that the way It is easier getting inside them gates than getting out again. Take that tool from him and give him a dose of the oil of stirrup.So one fellow put out his claws to seize on the flail but Tom gave him such a welt of it on the side of the head that he broke off one of his horns and made him roar like a devil as he was. Well they rushed at Tom but he gave them little and big such a thrashing as they didnt forget for a while. At last says the ould thief of all rubbing his elbow Let the fool out and woe to whoever lets him in again great or small.So out marched Tom and away with him without minding the shouting and cursing they kept up at him from the tops of the walls and when he got home to the big bawn of the palace there never was such running and racing as to see himself and the flail. When he had his story told he laid down the flail on the stone steps and bid no one for their lives to touch it. If the king and queen and princess made much of him before they made ten times more of him now but Redhead the mean scruffhound stole over and thought to catch hold of the flail to make an end of him. His fingers hardly touched it when he let a roar out of him as if heaven and earth were coming together and kept flinging his arms about and dancing that it was pitiful to look at him. Tom run at him as soon as he could rise caught his hands in his own two and rubbed them this way and that and the burning pain left them before you could reckon one. Well the poor fellow between the pain that was only just gone and the comfort he was in had the comicalest face that you ever see it was such a mixtherumgatherum of laughing and crying. Everybody burst out a laughingthe princess could not stop no more than the rest and then says Tom Now maam if there were fifty halves of you I hope youll give me them all.Well the princess looked at her father and by my word she came over to Tom and put her two delicate hands into his two rough ones and I wish it was myself was in his shoes that dayTom would not bring the flail into the palace. You may be sure no other body went near it and when the early risers were passing next morning they found two long clefts in the stone where it was after burning itself an opening downwards nobody could tell how far. But a messenger came in at noon and said that the Danes were so frightened when they heard of the flail coming into Dublin that they got into their ships and sailed away.Well I suppose before they were married Tom got some man like Pat Mara of Tomenine to learn him the principles of politeness fluxions gunnery and fortification decimal fractions practice and the rule of three direct the way hed be able to keep up a conversation with the royal family. Whether he ever lost his time learning them sciences Im not sure but its as sure as fate that his mother never more saw any want till the end of her days.
The Story of a Sharp Lad and a Sharper LadLong ago there lived a man who employed a boy to take care of his pigs. The lads name was Peter and he was commonly called by every one in the countryside Peterofthepigs.One day a man came up to him and saidSell me these seven pigs.I cant sell but six of them said Peter. I must keep one but you may buy the other six if you will cut off their tails and ears and leave them for me.The man promised to do this and the boy pocketed the money. The six pigs looked sad enough without their tails and ears as they were driven away by their new master.Peter led his one remaining pig down to the sand pit. He buried it halfway in the sand. He buried the tails and ears of the other six pigs too so that part of them stuck out. Then he ran with all speed for his master.Come and help me get the pigs out of the sand pit he called out.His master ran as fast as he could to the sand pit. There he saw one of the pigs halfway out of the sand. He and Peter together soon pulled it out completely. Then he took hold of the tail nearby. To his horror it appeared to break off in his hand.Run to the house and ask my wife to give you two shovels cried the owner of the pigs. With the shovels we can dig out the rest of the pigs.The boy ran to the house. He knew that his master kept his money in two big bags.My master says that you shall give me his two money bags said Peter to his mistress.The woman did not approve of doing this. Are you sure he said both of them she asked.Yes both of them said Peter. Go ask him yourself.Accordingly the woman ran out of the house.Did you say both of them she called to her husband.Yes both of them he replied. Be quick about it too.Of course the poor man thought that she was asking about the two shovels which he had sent Peter to get.Thus Peter received his masters two bags of money and set out into the world with the bags on his shoulder and his pockets full of the money he had obtained from the sale of the six pigs.After a time Peterofthepigs met a robber. The robber stole one of his money bags and ran away with it. Peter ran after him.Now it happened that the robber had just killed a deer. He was carrying the liver inside his blouse. As he ran he threw it back so that he could run faster. Peter saw what he had done.If you want to catch me youll have to throw away your liver too called out the robber over his shoulder.Peterofthepigs pulled out his knife and cut out his liver. Of course he dropped dead at once.When at last Peters master found out that he had been deceived he ran after the lad. As he found him lying dead there by the wayside he saidOh Peterofthepigs You were sharp but you found some one who was sharper.Thus it is in life.
A PARTY of Senecas went hunting. When they had killed many deer and were ready to go home they didnt know what to do with a little boy whose father and mother had died while they had been in the forest.The hunters had so much meat they couldnt carry the boy and he couldnt walk so far. At last they decided to leave him in the cabin leaving plenty of wood and meat.The child cried bitterly and begged to go but they left him.When the hunters reached home and the report went around that the child had been left in the woods every one thought it would die.After some days the chief sent a man to see if the child was alive.As soon as the messenger was outside of the village he changed himself into a bear.The little boy kept a fire cooked meat and lived. One cold night he began to cry the meat was almost gone and the wood was burned up. While crying he heard some one come to the door. After making a noise as if shaking A snow a man said Little boy you think you are going I o die you are not. I am going to take care of you. The chief has sent a man to see if you are alive but he will not be here for a long time. I will be your friend. When you want me think of me and I will come.The man went away and the boy fell asleep. In the morning he found a pile of wood at the door and on a low limb of a tree hung a piece of deer meat. Now he was happy he built a fire and cooked some of the meat.The next night the man came again he stopped at the door and shook his feet as if shaking off snow but he didnt go in. He called to the boy and said The man who is coming wont help you he has taken the form of a bear. He will be here at midday tomorrow. In the morning you will find between the roots of the old stump near the door a rusty knife. Sharpen it and kill the bear. When you hear him coming run to the spring where the tall hemlock stands and climb the tree the bear will follow you. Slip down on the other side and as he is coming down stab him in the forefoot.The boy did as the voice told him. When he had killed the bear he went back to the cabin. The next night the stranger came to the door and said My friend men are coming for you. Go home with them they will be good to you. The chief will adopt you and you will become the swiftest runner living but dont be proud and boast of your power. I am your friend but you will never see me. I am the one who is called GHA Wind. If you are in trouble think of me and I will help you. When the men come they will ask about the messenger the chief sent you will say I havent seen a man but one morning a strong wind went through the woods.The next day four men came with food for the boy. They saw that he had wood and meat but no bow or arrow. He went home with the men and the chief had him brought to his own house for the childs relatives were all dead.The chief said You will be my grandson and live with me. When they gave the boy a bow and arrows he asked for a club.What do you want of a club asked the chief.To kill deer.The chief had a club made for him. He chased deer overtook them hit them on the head and killed them. He killed birds before they could fly away. GHA had told him he would be the swiftest runner living and he always had that in mind. When he saw boys running he laughed and thought That running is nothing. I can run faster than any boy living.One night some one struck on the door near the boys bed and a man called out Who is in hereI am answered the boy.Well I challenge you to run a race with me. You think you are the swiftest runner in the world. We will start from the second mountain and run from sunrise till sundown.In the morning the boy asked the chief whom he called Grandfather if in the night he had heard some one talking outside.I did not answered the chief.Well a man came and challenged me to run a raceI dont think it was a man said the chief it must have been a beast and I am afraid you will get killed.Ive been challenged and I must go said the boy. I must be ready the third morning from this.He made ten pairs of moccasins put flint in his arrows and parched corn to eat. On the third morning he started When near the appointed place he saw a dark mass. At first he didnt know what it was but when daylight came he saw it was a great bear.When the sun appeared the bear said Now well start.He leaped across the valley and on to the first mountain where he struck the ground sank. He leaped from mountain to mountain but the boy had to run through the valleys.At midday the bear was ahead and the boy thought am lost. I wish my friend GHA would come.That minute GHA came as a whirlwind and carried the boy far ahead of the bear. As GHA traveled he threw down trees and that delayed the bear for it had to jump over them.At last the bears strength gave out and he called to the boy that he might have his life.The boy killed the bear then he burned tobacco to friend GHA and asked to be taken home GHA carried him in a whirlwind and put him down in front of the chiefs house.I have come Grandfather said the boy I have killed bear. You must send men to bring it home.The chief sent eight men. They were twenty days going and twenty returning the boy wasnt half a day for GHA had carried him over the woods and under the clouds.
The Story of a Boy who Learned His Lessons in SchoolOnce upon a time there lived a man who had three sons. The two older ones worked in the fields but the youngest one went to school. He learned how to read and write and do sums and make drawings. At last he even learned magic.The two elder brothers complained to their father about him one day. Their hearts were bitter against him.It is not fair father they said. We work hard every day in the fields and bring home money to enrich the family. Why shouldnt our brother work too He does nothing except study.The youngest son heard their words of complaint.Will you go hunting with me tomorrow father he asked. I have learned much magic. In fact I have become a master of magic. I will turn myself into a hunting dog if you will go into the fields with me.The next day the young man changed himself by magic into a hunting dog and his father went into the fields with him. He bagged many rabbits that day. As they returned home he met one of his friends.What luck today asked his friend.The hunter proudly displayed the rabbits he had in his bag. I have them thanks to my dog he said.Id like to buy that dog of yours said his friend. What will you take for himThe father named an enormous price and to his great surprise his friend accepted it. The money was passed over at once and the hunting dog went home with his new master.The next day they went on a hunting expedition into the deep forest. Suddenly the dog disappeared. His master called and whistled to him in vain. Finally he was obliged to return home without him. He had lost both the dog and the money he had paid for him.Have you seen my hunting dog were his words for many weeks to every one he met.His hunting dog had fled into a deep forest and once more resumed his original form. He returned home and told his two brothers that in a single day he had earned for his father more than their combined efforts for many weeks. Indeed it was quite true.The next day the young man said to his father Will you buy a saddle and bridle for me if I turn myself into a horseHis father made the purchase and then the young man changed into a handsome black horse. His father rode him up and down the streets very proudly. The Great Magician noticed the beautiful beast.He called the man to him and said That is a very good horse you are riding. What will you sell him forThe father named an enormous price but he at once paid it cheerfully. He ordered the horse placed in his stables.Now this Great Magician had a beautiful daughter who was very fond of horses. She went out to inspect his new purchase as soon as it was brought home. She noticed that the horse ate nothing.What a beauty she cried as she stroked his glossy black coat. You are the handsomest horse in the stable. Why dont you eat I believe your bridle is hurting you. Im going to take it off.As soon as the bridle was removed it was changed into a bird and flew out the window. The Great Magician at that moment changed himself into a hawk and killed the bird never dreaming that it was the bridle of the new horse he had purchased.The next morning when the Great Magician went to mount his beautiful black steed there was no new horse to be found in the stable. The horse had changed into a kernel of corn.The Great Magician transformed himself into a hen to eat up the corn but the youth was too quick for him. He changed into a dog and seized the hen between his teeth and gave it a good shaking. Then he returned to his own form and explained the whole affair to the Great Magician.You are surely a master of magic was the comment of the magician.When the Great Magician had forgiven him for the shaking he had received when he was in the form of a hen he gladly gave his consent to his daughters marriage to the master of magic.
The end Outa please said little Jan the end of The Animals Dam. You said it was too long to finish last night.Aja my baasje its full of jakhals draaie and thats why it is so long but its near the end now.The night was old by the time the animals had finished with old Broer Babiaan and the stars were going out. Only the Big Star that lasts the longest was travelling quickly by the Stars Road to call the Dawn. It began to get light already at the place where the shining Old Man gets up every day and that meant it was time for the animals to fade away to their sleepingplaces.Oom Leeuw looked round on them. Who will look after the dam tonight he asked.I will said a little voice quickly. Peep peepAnd who is this that speaks from the ground asked Oom. Let us find this brave one.They looked about in the sand and there under a milkbush near the dam sat the Water Tortoise. He was nice and big baasjes as big as the lid of the soappot and his skinny legs were very strong. He stretched out his skinny neck and twinkled his little black eyes.Ill look after the dam Oom and Ill catch the WaterSpoiler for you.Ha ha ha How will you do that asked Oom Leeuw.If Oom will just let someone rub my back with the sticky black stuff from the floor of the hives then Oom will see what will happen.This is a wise little man said Oom Leeuw and he ordered Old Brown Sister Hyenashe with the limp in the left hind legto rub the Water Tortoise with the sticky stuff.That night my baasjes when Jakhals went to the dam to drink he peeped about but no there was no one to guard the dam only a large black stone lay near the edge of the water.Arr this is lucky said Jakhals. Such a nice large stone Ill stand on it while I drink.He didnt know that the stone had a strong skinny neck and on the end of the neck a head with little bright eyes that could see everything that was going on. So he gave a jump andwoopsdown he came on to the stone with his two front feet and there they stuck fast to the sticky black stuff and he could not move them. He tried and he tried but it was no use.Toever he screamed toever Let me goPeep peep said a little voice dont be frightened.Who says Im frightened you old toever stone asked Jakhals. Though my front feet are fast I can still kick with my hind feet.Kick kick kick and stick fast said the little voice.So Jakhals kicked and kicked and his hind feet stuck fast.There was a funny sound under the water like water bubbling through a reed. It was the Water Tortoise laughing.Nierrr nierrr said Jakhals getting very cross Ive still got a tail and Ill beat you with it.Beat beat beat and stick fast said the little voice.So Jakhals beat and beat and his tail stuck fast.Nierrr he said again very angry Ive still got a mouth and Ill bite you with it.Bite bite bite and stick fast said the little voice.Jakhals opened his mouth and bit and bit and his mouth stuck fast. There he was all in a bundle sticking altogether fast to the black stone and the more he tried to get free the more he stuck fast.Peep peep said the Water Tortoise poking up his head and laughing. Then he marched to the top of the damwall where everyone could see the strange sight and there he sat all quiet and good till the other animals came.Arr they were glad when they saw Jakhals sticking to the Water Tortoise. They held a Council and ordered him to be killed and Broer Hyenaold Brown Sisters husbandwas to be the killer.They loosened Jakhals mouth from the sticky stuff so that he could talk for the last time. He was very sorry for himself. His voice was thick with sorriness and he could hardly get the words out.Thank you Oom he said. I know Im a wicked creature. Its better for me to die than to live and trouble everyone so much.Oom Leeuw and the other animals were wondering what kind of death the Waterstealer should die.Chop my head off said Jakhals throw me in the fountain but please ach please dont shave my tail and hit me on the big stone.Oom Leeuw and the others were still putting their heads together.Beat me with kieries drown me in the dam said Jakhals but dont ach please dont smear my tail with fat and hit me on the big stone.Oom Leeuw and the others made as if they were taking no notice of him.Chop me in little pieces beat me with thorn branches said Jakhals but please ach please dont take me by the tail and hit me on the big stone.At last Oom Leeuw turned round.Just as you say it shall be done. Shave his tail he said to the others smear it with fat and hit his head on the big stone. Let it be done.So it was done and Jakhals stood very still and sad while his tail was being shaved and smeared. But when Hyena swung him roundone two three phtaway he slipped and ran over the veld as fast as he could. All the others ran after him but they were only running to catch and he was running to live so he went like the wind and soon they were left far behind.He never stopped till he came to a mountain where a krantz hung over and made a kind of cave and in he crept. The first to come after him was Oom Leeuw who had run faster than the others. Jakhals watched Oom crawling in and when Ooms head touched the top of the cave he ran out callingOom Oom the krantz is falling. If you dont hold it up youll be crushed to death. Ill run and get a pole to prop it up but Oom must please wait till I come back.He left Oom plastering his head against the krantz to hold it up whilephthe shot away and never stopped till he got safe home where he rolled bolmakissie over and over laughing to think how he had cheated all the animals again.
A rich man in a certain town once owned a dog and a cat both of which were very useful to him. The dog had served his master for many years and had become so old that he had lost his teeth and was unable to fight any more but he was a good guide and companion to the cat who was strong and cunning.The master had a daughter who was attending school at a convent some distance from home and very often he sent the dog and the cat with presents to the girl.One day he called the faithful animals and bade them carry a magic ring to his daughter.You are strong and brave he said to the cat You may carry the ring but you must be careful not to drop itAnd to the dog he said You must accompany the cat to guide her and keep her from harm.They promised to do their best and started out. All went well until they came to a river. As there was neither bridge nor boat there was no way to cross but to swim.Let me take the magic ring said the dog as they were about to plunge into the water.Oh no replied the cat the master gave it to me to carry.But you cannot swim well argued the dog. I am strong and can take good care of it.But the cat refused to give up the ring until finally the dog threatened to kill her and then she reluctantly gave it to him.The river was wide and the water so swift that they grew very tired and just before they reached the opposite bank the dog dropped the ring. They searched carefully but could not find it anywhere and after a while they turned back to tell their master of the sad loss. Just before reaching the house however the dog was so overcome with fear that he turned and ran away and never was seen again.The cat went on alone and when the master saw her coming he called out to know why she had returned so soon and what had become of her companion. The poor cat was frightened but as well as she could she explained how the ring had been lost and how the dog had run away.On hearing her story the master was very angry and commanded that all his people should search for the dog and that it should be punished by having its tail cut off.He also ordered that all the dogs in the world should join in the search and ever since when one dog meets another he says Are you the old dog that lost the magic ring If so your tail must be cut off. Then immediately each shows his teeth and wags his tail to prove that he is not the guilty one.Since then too cats have been afraid of water and will not swim across a river if they can avoid it.
Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once but one must always be with him. Now when they were grown up six were to set off to woo but as for the youngest his father kept him at home and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace.So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off and each had his horse which cost many many hundred pounds and so they set off. Now when they had been to many palaces and seen many princesses at last they came to a King who had six daughters such lovely kings daughters they had never seen and so they fell to wooing them each one and when they had got them for sweethearts they set off home again but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots their brother who stayed at home for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts.Listen to this and many other Asbjrnsen  Moe fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio App for Apple and Android devicesBut when they had gone a good bit on their way they passed close by a steep hillside like a wall where the Giants house was and there the Giant came out and set his eyes upon them and turned them all into stone princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons but the more he waited the longer they stayed away so he fell into great trouble and said he should never know what it was to be glad again.And if I had not you left he said to Boots I would live no longer so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers.Well but now Ive been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again thats what Im thinking of said Boots.Nay nay said his father that leave you shall never get for then you would stay away too.But Boots had set his heart upon it go he would and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old brokendown jade for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses but Boots did not care a pin for that he sprang up on his sorry old steed.Farewell father said he Ill come back never fear and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me and with that he rode off.So when he had ridden a while he came to a Raven which lay in the road and flapped its wings and was not able to get out of the way it was so starved.Oh dear friend said the Raven give me a little food and Ill help you again at your utmost need.I havent much food said the Prince and I dont see how youll ever be able to help me much but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it.So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.Now when he had gone a bit further he came to a brook and in the brook lay a great Salmon which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about and could not get into the water again.Oh dear friend said the Salmon to the Prince shove me out into the water again and Ill help you again at your utmost need.Well said the Prince the help youll give me will not be great I daresay but its a pity you should lie there and choke and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again.After that he went a long long way and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly.Dear friend do let me have your horse said the Wolf Im so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs Ive had nothing to eat these two years.No said Boots this will never do first I came to a raven and I was forced to give him my food next I came to a salmon and him I had to help into the water again and now you will have my horse. It cant be done that it cant for then I should have nothing to ride on.Nay dear friend but you can help me said Graylegs the wolf you can ride upon my back and Ill help you again in your utmost need.Well the help I shall get from you will not be great Ill be bound said the Prince but you may take my horse since you are in such need.So when the Wolf had eaten the horse Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolfs jaw and laid the saddle on his back and now the Wolf was so strong after what he had got inside that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before.When we have gone a bit farther said Graylegs Ill show you the Giants house.So after a while they came to it.See here is the Giants house said the Wolf and see here are your six brothers whom the Giant has turned into stone and see here are their six brides and away yonder is the door and in that door you must go.Nay but I darent go in said the Prince hell take my life.No no said the Wolf when you get in youll find a Princess and shell tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you.Well Boots went in but truth to say he was very much afraid. When he came in the Giant was away but in one of the rooms sat the Princess just as the Wolf had said and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on.Oh heaven help you whence have you come said the Princess as she saw him it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here for he has no heart in his body.Well well said Boots but now that I am here I may as well try what I can do with him and I will see if I cant free my brothers who are standing turned to stone out of doors and you too I will try to save that I will.Well if you must you must said the Princess and so let us see if we cant hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But pray do lie as still as a mouse.So he crept under the bed and he had scarce got well underneath it before the Giant came.Ha roared the Giant what a smell of Christian blood there is in the houseYes I know there is said the Princess for there came a magpie flying with a mans bone and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out but all one can do the smell doesnt go off so soon.So the Giant said no more about it and when night came they went to bed. After they had lain a while the Princess saidThere is one thing Id be so glad to ask you about if I only dared.What thing is that asked the Giant.Only where it is you keep your heart since you dont carry it about you said the Princess.Ah thats a thing youve no business to ask about but if you must know it lies under the doorsill said the Giant.Ho ho said Boots to himself under the bed then well soon see if we cant find it.Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early and strode off to the wood but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the doorsill for his heart but the more they dug and the more they hunted the more they couldnt find it.He has baulked us this time said the Princess but well try him once more.So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find and strewed them over the doorsill which they had laid in its right place again and when the time came for the Giant to come home again Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under back came the Giant.Snuffsnuff went the Giants nose. My eyes and limbs what a smell of Christian blood there is in here said he.I know there is said the Princess for there came a magpie flying with a mans bone in his bill and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out but I daresay its that you smell.So the Giant held his peace and said no more about it. A little while after he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the doorsill.Oh I of course said the Princess.And pray whats the meaning of all this said the Giant.Ah said the Princess Im so fond of you that I couldnt help strewing them when I knew that your heart lay under there.You dont say so said the Giant but after all it doesnt lie there at all.So when they went to bed again in the evening the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was for she said she would so like to know.Well said the Giant if you must know it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall.So so thought Boots and the Princess then well soon try to find it.Next morning the Giant was away early and strode off to the wood and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart but the more they sought for it the less they found it.Well said the Princess well just try him once more.So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands and when the time came for the Giant to come home Boots crept under the bed again.Then back came the Giant.Snuffsnuff My eyes and limbs what a smell of Christian blood there is in hereI know there is said the Princess for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a mans bone in his bill and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again but after all my pains I daresay its that you smell.When the Giant heard that he said no more about it but a little while after he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands so he asked who it was that had done that Who could it be but the PrincessAnd pray whats the meaning of all this tomfoolery asked the Giant.Oh Im so fond of you I couldnt help doing it when I knew that your heart lay there said the Princess.How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing said the Giant.Oh yes how can I help believing it when you say it said the Princess.Youre a goose said the Giant where my heart is you will never come.Well said the Princess but for all that twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies.Then the poor Giant could hold out no longer but was forced to sayFar far away in a lake lies an island on that island stands a church in that church is a well in that well swims a duck in that duck there is an egg and in that egg there lies my heartyou darlingIn the morning early while it was still grey dawn the Giant strode off to the wood.He took a long long farewell of the Princess and when he got out of the Giants door there stood the Wolf waiting for him. Illustration by Kay Nielsen. Published in East of the Sun and West of the Moon by Peter Christen Asbjrnsen and Jrgen Engebretsen Moe 1922. George H. Doran Company.Yes now I must set off too said Boots if I only knew how to find the way. He took a long long farewell of the Princess and when he got out of the Giants door there stood the Wolf waiting for him. So Boots told him all that had happened inside the house and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church if he only knew the way. So the Wolf bade him jump on his back hed soon find the way and away they went till the wind whistled after them over hedge and field over hill and dale. After they had travelled many many days they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not know how to get over it but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid but stick on and so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back and swam over to the island. So they came to the church but the church keys hung high high up on the top of the tower and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down.You must call on the raven said the Wolf.So the Prince called on the raven and in a trice the raven came and flew up and fetched the keys and so the Prince got into the church. But when he came to the well there lay the duck and swam about backwards and forwards just as the Giant had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it till it came to him and he grasped it in his hand but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well and then Boots was beside himself to know how to get it out again.Well now you must call on the salmon to be sure said the Wolf and the kings son called on the salmon and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well.Then the Wolf told him to squeeze the egg and as soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out.Squeeze it again said the Wolf and when the Prince did so the Giant screamed still more piteously and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in two.Tell him if he will restore to life again your six brothers and their brides whom he has turned to stone you will spare his life said the Wolf. Yes the Giant was ready to do that and he turned the six brothers into kings sons again and their brides into kings daughters.Now squeeze the egg in two said the Wolf. So Boots squeezed the egg to pieces and the Giant burst at once.Now when he had made an end of the Giant Boots rode back again on the Wolf to the Giants house and there stood all his six brothers alive and merry with their brides. Then Boots went into the hillside after his bride and so they all set off home again to their fathers house. And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back each with his brideBut the loveliest bride of all is the bride of Boots after all said the king and he shall sit uppermost at the table with her by his side.So he sent out and called a great weddingfeast and the mirth was both loud and long and if they have not done feasting why they are still at it.
Once upon a time a poor old beggar woman stood shivering by the side of a road which led to a prosperous village. She hoped some traveler would be touched by her misery and would give her a few pennies with which to buy food and fuel.It had been snowing since early morning and a sharp east wind made the evening air bitterly cold. At the sound of approaching footsteps the old womans face brightened with expectancy but the next moment her eager expression changed to disappointment for the traveler passed without giving her anything.Poor old woman he said to himself. This is a bitter cold night to be begging on the roadside. It is indeed. I am truly sorry for her.And as his footsteps became fainter the beggar woman whispered I must not give up. Perhaps the next traveler will help me.In a little while she heard the sound of wheels. It happened to be the carriage of the mayor who was on his way to a Thanksgiving banquet. When his excellency saw the miserable old woman he ordered the carriage to stop lowered the window and took a piece of money from his pocket.Here you are he called holding out a coin.The woman hurried to the window as fast as she could. Before she reached it however the mayor noticed that he had taken a gold piece instead of a silver one out of his pocket.Wait a moment he said. Ive made a mistake.He intended to exchange the coin for one of less value but he caught his sleeve on the window fastening and dropped the gold piece in the snow. The woman had come up to the carriage window and he noticed that she was blind.Ive dropped the money my good woman he said but it lies near you there in the snow. No doubt youll find it.Thank you sir thank you said the beggar kneeling down to search for the coin.On rolled the mayor to the banquet. It was foolish to give her gold he thought but Im a rich man and I seldom make such a mistake.That night after the banquet when the mayor sat before a blazing fire in his comfortable chair the picture of the beggar woman kneeling in the snow and fumbling around for the gold piece came before his eyes.I hope she will make good use of my generous gift he mused. It was entirely too much to give but no doubt I shall be rewarded for my charity.The first traveler hurried on his way until he came to the village inn where a great wood fire crackled merrily in the cheery dining room. He took off his warm coat and sat down to wait for dinner to be served. But he could not forget the picture of the old beggar woman standing on the snowy roadside.Suddenly he rose put on his coat and said to the host Prepare dinner for two. I shall be back presently.He hastened back to the place where he had seen the poor old woman who was still on her knees in the snow searching for the mayors gold piece.My good woman what are you looking for he asked.A piece of money sir. The gentleman who gave it to me dropped it in the snow.Do not search any longer said the traveler but come with me to the village inn. There you may warm yourself before the great fire and we shall have a good dinner. Come you shall be my Thanksgiving guest.He helped her to her feet and then for the first time he saw that she was blind. Carefully he took her arm and led her along the road to the inn.Sit here and warm yourself he said placing her gently in a comfortable chair. In a few moments he led her to the table and gave her a good dinner.On that Thanksgiving Day an angel took up her pen and struck out all account of the gold piece from the book where the mayor recorded his good deeds. Another angel wrote in the travelers book of deeds an account of the old beggar womans Thanksgiving dinner at the village inn.
Godfather Misery was oldGod knows how old One day Jesus and St. Peter while wandering through the world to name the countries came to Godfather Miserys who offered his visitors some polenta and gave them his own bed. Jesus pleased with this reception gave him some money and granted him these three favors that whoever sits on his bench near the fire cannot get up that whoever climbs his figtree cannot descend and finally out of regard to St. Peter the salvation of his soul. One day Death came to Godfather Misery and wanted to carry him off. Godfather Misery said It is too cold to travel. Death pressed him then he asked her to sit by the fire and warm herself a moment and he would soon be ready. Meanwhile he piled wood on the fire. Death felt herself burning and tried to move but could not so she had to grant Godfather Misery another hundred years of life. Death was released the hundred years passed and Death returned.Godfather Misery was at the door pretending to wait for her and looking at his figtree in sorrow. He begged Death to pick him a few figs for their journey. So Death climbed up but could not descend until she granted Godfather Misery another hundred years. Even these passed and Death reappeared. This time there was no help he must go. Death gave him time only to recite an Ave Maria and a Paternoster. Godfather Misery however could not find this time and said to Death who was hurrying him You have given me time and I am taking it. Then Death had recourse to a stratagem and disguised herself like a Jesuit and went where Godfather Misery lived and preached. Godfather Misery at first did not attend these sermons but his wife finally persuaded him to go to the church and hear a sermon. Just as he entered the preacher cried out that whoever said an Ave Maria should save his soul. Godfather Misery who recognized Death answered from a distance Go away you will not get me. Then Death went away in despair and never got hold of him again. Godfather Misery still lives since misery never ends.
In a certain kingdom in a certain Empire there lived a Tsar with his Tsaritsa and he had three sons all of them young valiant and unwedded the like of whom is not to be told in tales nor written by pens and the youngest of them was called the Tsarevich Ivan. And the Tsar spoke these words to them My dear children take unto you your darts gird on your wellspanned bows and go hence in different directions and in whatsoever courts your arrows fall there choose ye your bridesThe elder brother discharged his arrow and it fell into a boyars court right in front of the terem of the maidens. The second brother discharged his arrow and it flew into the court of a merchant and remained sticking in a beautiful balcony and on this balcony was standing a lovely young maiden soul the merchants daughter. The youngest brother discharged his arrow and the arrow fell in a muddy swamp and a quackingfrog seized hold of it.The Tsarevich Ivan said to his father How can I ever take this quacker to wife A quacker is not my equalTake her replied his father tis thy fate to have herSo the Tsareviches all got marriedthe eldest to the boyars daughter the second to the merchants daughter and the youngest to the quackingfrog. And the Tsar called them to him and said Let your wives tomorrow morning bake me soft white bread.The Tsarevich Ivan returned home and he was not happy and his impetuous head hung down lower than his shoulders. Qua qua Ivan the Tsarevich wherefore art thou so sad asked the Frog. Or hast thou heard unpleasant words from thy father the TsarWhy should I not be sad my father and sovereign lord hath commanded thee to bake soft white bread tomorrow.Do not afflict thyself O Tsarevich lie down and rest the morning is wiser than the evening.She made the Tsarevich lie down and rest cast her frogskin and turned into a maiden soul Vasilisa Premudraya went out upon her beautiful balcony and cried with a piercing voice Nurseysnurseys assemble set to work and make me soft white bread such as I myself used to eat at my dear fathersIn the morning the Tsarevich Ivan awoke the frog had got the bread ready long ago and it was so splendid that the like of it is neither to be imagined nor guessed at but is only to be told of in tales. The loaves were adorned with various cunning devices royal cities were modelled on the sides thereof with moats and ditches. The Tsar praised the Tsarevich Ivan greatly because of his bread and gave this command to his three sons Let your wives weave me a carpet in a single night.The Tsarevich Ivan returned home and he was sad and his impetuous head hung lower than his shoulders. Qua qua Tsarevich Ivan wherefore art thou so sad Or hast thou heard cruel unfriendly words from thy father the TsarHave I not cause to grieve My father and sovereign lord commands thee to weave him a silk carpet in a single nightFret not Tsarevich come lay thee down and sleep the morning is wiser than the evening Then she made him lie down to sleep threw off her frogskin and turned into the lovely maiden soul Vasilisa Premudraya went forth upon her beautiful balcony and cried with a piercing voice Nurseysnurseys assemble set to work and weave me a silk carpet such as I was wont to sit upon at my dear fathersNo sooner said than done. In the morning the Tsarevich Ivan awoke and the frog had had the carpet ready long ago and it was such a wondrous carpet that the like of it can only be told of in tales but may neither be imagined nor guessed at. The carpet was adorned with gold and silver and with divers bright embroiderings. The Tsar greatly praised the Tsarevich Ivan for his carpet and there and then gave the new command that all three Tsareviches were to appear before him on the morrow to be inspected together with their wives.Again the Tsarevich Ivan returned home and he was not happy and his impetuous head hung lower than his shoulders. Qua qua Tsarevich Ivan wherefore art thou grieved Or hast thou heard words unkind from thy father the TsarHave I not cause to be sadMy father and sovereign lord has commanded me to appear before him with thee tomorrow How can I show thee to peopleFret not Tsarevich Go alone to the Tsar and pay thy visit and I will come after thee. The moment you hear a rumbling and a knocking say Hither comes my dear little Froggy in her little basketAnd behold the elder brothers appeared to be inspected with their richlyattired and splendidlyadorned consorts. There they stood and laughed at the Tsarevich Ivan and said Why brother why hast thou come hither without thy wife Why thou mightest have brought her with thee in a kitchen clout. And where didst thou pick up such a beauty I suppose thou didst search through all the swamps fairlySuddenly there was a great rumbling and knocking the whole palace shook. The guests were all terribly frightened and rushed from their places and knew not what to do with themselves but the Tsarevich Ivan said Fear not gentlemen tis only my little Froggy coming in her little basketAnd then a golden coach drawn by six horses flew up to the steps of the Tsars balcony and out of it stepped Vasilisa Premudraya such a beauty as is only to be told of in tales but can neither be imagined nor guessed at. The Tsarevich Ivan took her by the hand and led her behind the oaken table behind the embroidered tablecloth. The guests began to eat and drink and make merry. Vasilisa Premudraya drank wine but the dregs of her cup she poured behind her left sleeve she ate also of the roast swan but the bones thereof she concealed behind her right sleeve.The wives of the elder brothers watched these devices and took care to do the same. Afterwards when Vasilisa Premudraya began dancing with the Tsarevich Ivan she waved her left hand and a lake appeared she waved her right hand and white swans were swimming in the water the Tsar and his guests were astonished. And now the elder brides began dancing. They waved their left hands and all the guests were squirted with water they waved their right hands and the bones flew right into the Tsars eyes. The Tsar was wroth and drove them from court with dishonour.Now one day the Tsarevich Ivan waited his opportunity ran off home found the frogskin and threw it into a great fire. Vasilisa Premudraya duly arrived missed her frogskin was sore troubled fell aweeping and said to the Tsarevich Alas Tsarevich Ivan what hast thou done If thou hadst but waited for a little I should have been thine for ever more but now farewell Seek for me beyond lands thricenine in the Empire of Thriceten at the house of Koshchei Bezsmertny. Then she turned into a white swan and flew out of the window.The Tsarevich Ivan wept bitterly turned to all four points of the compass and prayed to God and went straight before his eyes. He went on and on whether it was near or far or long or short matters not when there met him an old old man. Hail good youth said he what dost thou seek and whither art thou going The Tsarevich told him all his misfortune.Alas Tsarevich Ivan why didst thou burn that frogskin Thou didst not make nor shouldst thou therefore have done away with it. Vasilisa Premudraya was born wiser and more cunning than her father he was therefore angry with her and bade her be a frog for three years. Here is a little ball for thee follow it whithersoever it rolls. Ivan the Tsarevich thanked the old man and followed after the ball. He went along the open plain and there met him a bear.Come now thought the Tsarevich Ivan I will slay this beast. But the bear implored him Slay me not Tsarevich Ivan I may perchance be of service to thee somehow. He went on further and lo behind them came waddling a duck. The Tsarevich bent his bow he would have shot the bird when suddenly she greeted him with a human voice Slay me not Ivan Tsarevich I also may befriend theeHe had compassion on her and went on further and a hare darted across their path. The Tsarevich again laid an arrow on his bow and took aim but the hare greeted him with a human voice Slay me not Tsarevich Ivan I also will befriend thee Ivan the Tsarevich had pity upon him and went on further to the blue sea and behold on the beach lay gasping a pike. Alas Tsarevich Ivan sighed the pike have pity on me and cast me into the sea.And he cast it into the sea and went on along the shore. The ball rolled a short way and it rolled a long way and at last it came to a miserable hut the hut was standing on hens legs and turning round and round. The Tsarevich Ivan said to it Little hut little hut stand the old way as thy mother placed thee with thy front to me and thy back to the sea And the little hut turned round with its front to him and its back to the sea.The Tsarevich entered in and saw the bonylegged BabaYaga lying on the stove on nine bricks and grinding her teeth.Hillo good youth why dost thou visit me asked the BabaYaga.Fie thou old hag thou callst me a good youth but thou shouldst first feed and give me to drink and prepare me a bath then only shouldst thou ask me questions. The BabaYaga fed him and gave him to drink and made ready a bath for him and the Tsarevich told her he was seeking his wife Vasilisa Premudraya.I know said the BabaYaga she is now with Koshchei Bezsmertny. Tis hard to get thither and it is not easy to settle accounts with Koshchei. His death depends upon the point of a needle that needle is in a hare that hare is in a coffer that coffer is on the top of a high oak and Koshchei guards that tree as the apple of his eye.The BabaYaga then showed him in what place that oak grew the Tsarevich Ivan went thither but did not know what to do to get at the coffer. Suddenly how who can tell the bear rushed at the tree and tore it up by the roots the coffer fell and was smashed to pieces the hare leaped out and with one bound had taken cover. But look the other hare bounded off in pursuit hunted him down and tore him to bits out of the hare flew a duck and rose high high in the air but the other duck dashed after her and struck her down whereupon the duck laid an egg and the egg fell into the sea.The Tsarevich Ivan seeing the irreparable loss of the egg burst into tears when suddenly the pike came swimming ashore holding the egg between its teeth. He took the egg broke it drew out the needle and broke off its little point. Then he attacked Koshchei who struggled hard but wriggle about as he might he had to die at last. Then the Tsarevich Ivan went into the house of Koshchei took out Vasilisa Premudraya and returned home. After that they lived together for a long long time and were very very happy.
A powerful conjurer who had a bear for his mascot thought he would like to go to the Moon. He had his hands tied up and a rope fastened around his knees and neck. Then he sat down at the rear of his hut with his back to the lamps and had the light extinguished.He called for his mascot and the bear at once appeared and he mounted its back. Up it carried him above the village above the mountains up and up till they reached the Moon. To his surprise the Moon was a house which was covered with beautiful white deerskins. Now white deer are strange and sacred and are hatched from long white eggs buried deep in the soil. There is mystery and magic in white deer white buffalo and in all albino animals. The Man in the Moon dried these white deerskins and fastened them over his house which as I said is the Moon itself.Illustration by George Carlson. Published in A Treasury of Eskimo Tales by Clara k. Bayliss 1922.On each side of the door to the house was the upper part of an enormous walrus. The beasts were alive and they threatened to tear the visitor in pieces. It was very dangerous to try to pass the fierce animals but the conjurer told his mascot to growl as loud as it could and that startled the walruses for an instant and in that instant the man slipped in.It must be chilly in the Moon for the house had a passageway to keep out the cold just as the Eskimo houses have. In this passageway was a redandwhite spotted dog the only dog which the Man in the Moon keeps. The man went on past this dog and into the inner room. There at the left he saw a door into another building in which sat a beautiful woman with a lamp before her. As soon as she saw the stranger she blew on her fire and made it flash up and she hid behind the blaze but he had seen enough so that he knew she was the Sun.The Man in the Moon rose from his seat on the ledge and came over to shake hands with the visitor and welcome him. Behind the lamps there was a great heap of venison and seal meat but the Man in the Moon did not offer his guest any of it which is not the way the Eskimo and Indians treat their guests. The Man in the Moon seemed to have a different idea of hospitality for he immediately saidMy wife Ulul will soon be here and we will have a dance. Mind you dont laugh or she will slice you in two with her knife and feed you to my ermine which is in yon little house outside.Before long a woman entered carrying an oblong choppingbowl in which lay her choppingknife. She set it down and stooped forward turning the bowl as if it were a whirligig. Then she commenced dancing and when she turned her back toward the stranger he saw that she was hollow. She had no back backbone or insides but only lungs and heart.Her husband presently joined in the dance and their attitudes and grimaces were so ludicrous that the stranger could scarcely keep from laughing. He did not wish to be impolite so he kept turning his face aside and pretending to cough. Fortunately for him just as he thought he would surely explode with laughter he recalled the warning the man had given him and rushed out of the house. The Man guessed what was the matter with him and called outBetter call your white bear mascotHe did so and escaped unhurt.However he went into the house another day and succeeded in keeping his face straight so when their performance was ended the Man in the Moon was very friendly to him and showed him all around the house and let him look into a small building near the entrance.In this building there were large herds of deer which seemed to be roaming over vast plains. The Man in the Moon said You may choose one of these for your own and as soon as he did so the animal fell through a hole and alighted on the earth right by the conjurers hut.In another building there were many seals swimming in an ocean and he was allowed to choose one of these which also fell down to his hut.Now you have seen all I can show you and you may go home said the Moon Man. So the conjurer called his mascot and rode down through the air to his hut.There his body had lain motionless while his spirit was away but now it revived. The cords with which his hands and knees had been bound dropped off though they had been tied in hard knots. The conjurer felt quite exhausted from his trip but when the lamps were lighted he told his eager neighbors all that he had seen during his flight to the Moon.
A folktale in its primitive plainness of word and entire absence of complexity in thought is peculiarly sensitive and susceptible to the touch of stranger hands and he who has been able to acquaint himself with the Norske Folkeeventyr of Asbjrnsen and Moe from which these stories are selected has an advantage over the reader of an English rendering. Of this advantage Mr. Kay Nielsen has fully availed himself and the exquisite bizarrerie of his drawings aptly expresses the innermost significance of the oldworld oldwives fables. For to term these legends Nursery Tales would be to curtail them by ninetenths of their interest. They are the romances of the childhood of Nations they are the neverfailing springs of sentiment of sensation of heroic example from which primeval peoples drank their fill at will.The quaintness the tenderness the grotesque yet realistic intermingling of actuality with supernaturalism by which the original Norske Folkeeventyr are characterised will make an appeal to all as represented in the pictures of Kay Nielsen. And these imperishable traditions whose bases are among the very roots of all antiquity are here reincarnated in line and colour to the delight of all who ever knew or now shall know them.Permission to reprint the Stories in this book which originally appeared in Sir G.

There lived once upon a time in the land of Marigliano a poor woman called Masella who had six pretty daughters all as upright as young firtrees and an only son called Antonio who was so simple as to be almost an idiot. Hardly a day passed without his mother saying to him What are you doing you useless creature If you werent too stupid to look after yourself I would order you to leave the house and never to let me see your face again.Every day the youth committed some fresh piece of folly till at last Masella losing all patience gave him a good beating which so startled Antonio that he took to his heels and never stopped running till it was dark and the stars were shining in the heavens. He wandered on for some time not knowing where to go and at last he came to a cave at the mouth of which sat an ogre uglier than anything you can conceive.He had a huge head and wrinkled broweyebrows that met squinting eyes a flat broad nose and a great gash of a mouth from which two huge tusks stuck out. His skin was hairy his arms enormous his legs like sword blades and his feet as flat as ducks. In short he was the most hideous and laughable object in the world.But Antonio who with all his faults was no coward and was moreover a very civilspoken lad took off his hat and said Goodday sir I hope you are pretty well. Could you kindly tell me how far it is from here to the place where I wish to goWhen the ogre heard this extraordinary question he burst out laughing and as he liked the youths polite manners he said to him Will you enter my serviceWhat wages do you give replied Antonio.If you serve me faithfully returned the ogre Ill be bound youll get enough wages to satisfy you.So the bargain was struck and Antonio agreed to become the ogres servant. He was very well treated in every way and he had little or no work to do with the result that in a few days he became as fat as a quail as round as a barrel as red as a lobster and as impudent as a bantamcock.But after two years the lad got weary of this idle life and longed desperately to visit his home again. The ogre who could see into his heart and knew how unhappy he was said to him one day My dear Antonio I know how much you long to see your mother and sisters again and because I love you as the apple of my eye I am willing to allow you to go home for a visit. Therefore take this donkey so that you may not have to go on foot but see that you never say Bricklebrit to him for if you do youll be sure to regret it.Antonio took the beast without as much as saying thank you and jumping on its back he rode away in great haste but he hadnt gone two hundred yards when he dismounted and called out Bricklebrit.No sooner had he pronounced the word than the donkey opened its mouth and poured forth rubies emeralds diamonds and pearls as big as walnuts.Antonio gazed in amazement at the sight of such wealth and joyfully filling a huge sack with the precious stones he mounted the donkey again and rode on till he came to an inn. Here he got down and going straight to the landlord he said to him My good man I must ask you to stable this donkey for me. Be sure you give the poor beast plenty of oats and hay but beware of saying the word Bricklebrit to him for if you do I can promise you will regret it. Take this heavy sack too and put it carefully away for me.The landlord who was no fool on receiving this strange warning and seeing the precious stones sparkling through the canvas of the sack was most anxious to see what would happen if he used the forbidden word. So he gave Antonio an excellent dinner with a bottle of fine old wine and prepared a comfortable bed for him. As soon as he saw the poor simpleton close his eyes and had heard his lusty snores he hurried to the stables and said to the donkey Bricklebrit and the animal as usual poured out any number of precious stones.When the landlord saw all these treasures he longed to get possession of so valuable an animal and determined to steal the donkey from his foolish guest. As soon as it was light next morning Antonio awoke and having rubbed his eyes and stretched himself about a hundred times he called the landlord and said to him Come here my friend and produce your bill for short reckonings make long friends.When Antonio had paid his account he went to the stables and took out his donkey as he thought and fastening a sack of gravel which the landlord had substituted for his precious stones on the creatures back he set out for his home.No sooner had he arrived there than he called out Mother come quickly and bring tablecloths and sheets with you and spread them out on the ground and you will soon see what wonderful treasures I have brought you.His mother hurried into the house and opening the linenchest where she kept her daughters wedding outfits she took out tablecloths and sheets made of the finest linen and spread them flat and smooth on the ground. Antonio placed the donkey on them and called out Bricklebrit. But this time he met with no success for the donkey took no more notice of the magic word than he would have done if a lyre had been twanged in his ear. Two three and four times did Antonio pronounce Bricklebrit but all in vain and he might as well have spoken to the wind.Disgusted and furious with the poor creature he seized a thick stick and began to beat it so hard that he nearly broke every bone in its body. The miserable donkey was so distracted at such treatment that far from pouring out precious stones it only tore and dirtied all the fine linen.When poor Masella saw her tablecloths and sheets being destroyed and that instead of becoming rich she had only been made a fool of she seized another stick and belaboured Antonio so unmercifully with it that he fled before her and never stopped till he reached the ogres cave.When his master saw the lad returning in such a sorry plight he understood at once what had happened to him and making no bones about the matter he told Antonio what a fool he had been to allow himself to be so imposed upon by the landlord and to let a worthless animal be palmed off on him instead of his magic donkey.Antonio listened humbly to the ogres words and vowed solemnly that he would never act so foolishly again. And so a year passed and once more Antonio was overcome by a fit of homesickness and felt a great longing to see his own people again.Now the ogre although he was so hideous to look upon had a very kind heart and when he saw how restless and unhappy Antonio was he at once gave him leave to go home on a visit. At parting he gave him a beautiful tablecloth and said Give this to your mother but see that you dont lose it as you lost the donkey and till you are safely in your own house beware of saying Tablecloth open and Tablecloth shut. If you do the misfortune be on your own head for I have given you fair warning.Antonio set out on his journey but hardly had he got out of sight of the cave than he laid the tablecloth on the ground and said Tablecloth open. In an instant the tablecloth unfolded itself and disclosed a whole mass of precious stones and other treasures.When Antonio perceived this he said Tablecloth shut and continued his journey. He came to the same inn again and calling the landlord to him he told him to put the tablecloth carefully away and whatever he did not to say Tablecloth open or Tablecloth shut to it.The landlord who was a regular rogue answered Just leave it to me I will look after it as if it were my own.After he had given Antonio plenty to eat and drink and had provided him with a comfortable bed he went straight to the tablecloth and said Tablecloth open. It opened at once and displayed such costly treasures that the landlord made up his mind on the spot to steal it.When Antonio awoke next morning the host handed him over a tablecloth exactly like his own and carrying it carefully over his arm the foolish youth went straight to his mothers house and said Now we shall be rich beyond the dreams of avarice and need never go about in rags again or lack the best of food.With these words he spread the tablecloth on the ground and said Tablecloth open.But he might repeat the injunction as often as he pleased it was only waste of breath for nothing happened. When Antonio saw this he turned to his mother and said That old scoundrel of a landlord has done me once more but he will live to repent it for if I ever enter his inn again I will make him suffer for the loss of my donkey and the other treasures he has robbed me of.Masella was in such a rage over her fresh disappointment that she could not restrain her impatience and turning on Antonio she abused him soundly and told him to get out of her sight at once for she would never acknowledge him as a son of hers again. The poor boy was very depressed by her words and slunk back to his master like a dog with his tail between his legs. When the ogre saw him he guessed at once what had happened. He gave Antonio a good scolding and said I dont know what prevents me smashing your head in you useless neerdowell You blurt everything out and your long tongue never ceases wagging for a moment. If you had remained silent in the inn this misfortune would never have overtaken you so you have only yourself to blame for your present suffering.Antonio listened to his masters words in silence looking for all the world like a whipped dog. When he had been three more years in the ogres service he had another bad fit of homesickness and longed very much to see his mother and sisters again.So he asked for permission to go home on a visit and it was at once granted to him. Before he set out on his journey the ogre presented him with a beautifully carved stick and said Take this stick as a remembrance of me but beware of saying Rise up Stick and Lie down Stick for if you do I can only say I wouldnt be in your shoes for something.Antonio took the stick and said Dont be in the least alarmed Im not such a fool as you think and know better than most people what two and two make.Im glad to hear it replied the ogre but words are women deeds are men. You have heard what I said and forewarned is forearmed.This time Antonio thanked his master warmly for all his kindness and started on his homeward journey in great spirits but he had not gone half a mile when he said Rise up Stick.The words were hardly out of his mouth when the stick rose and began to rain down blows on poor Antonios back with such lightninglike rapidity that he had hardly strength to call out Lie down Stick but as soon as he uttered the words the stick lay down and ceased beating his back black and blue.Although he had learnt a lesson at some cost to himself Antonio was full of joy for he saw a way now of revenging himself on the wicked landlord. Once more he arrived at the inn and was received in the most friendly and hospitable manner by his host. Antonio greeted him cordially and said My friend will you kindly take care of this stick for me But whatever you do dont say Rise up Stick. If you do you will be sorry for it and you neednt expect any sympathy from me.The landlord thinking he was coming in for a third piece of good fortune gave Antonio an excellent supper and after he had seen him comfortably to bed he ran to the stick and calling to his wife to come and see the fun he lost no time in pronouncing the words Rise up Stick.The moment he spoke the stick jumped up and beat the landlord so unmercifully that he and his wife ran screaming to Antonio and waking him up pleaded for mercy.When Antonio saw how successful his trick had been he said I refuse to help you unless you give me all that you have stolen from me otherwise you will be beaten to death.The landlord who felt himself at deaths door already cried out Take back your property only release me from this terrible stick and with these words he ordered the donkey the tablecloth and other treasures to be restored to their rightful owner.As soon as Antonio had recovered his belongings he said Stick lie down and it stopped beating the landlord at once.Then he took his donkey and tablecloth and arrived safely at his home with them. This time the magic words had the desired effect and the donkey and tablecloth provided the family with treasures untold. Antonio very soon married off his sister made his mother rich for life and they all lived happily for ever after.
It was on the day after the battle of Germantown that Warner who wore the blue met his hated neighbor the Tory Dabney near that bloody field.By a common impulse the men fell upon each other with their knives andWarner soon had his enemy in a position to give him the deathstroke butDabney began to bellow for quarter. My brother cried for quarter atPaoli answered the other and you struck him to the heart.I have a wife and child. Spare me for their sakes.My brother had a wife and two children. Perhaps you would like to beg your life of them.Though made in mockery this proposition was caught at so earnestly that Warner at length consented to take his adversary firmly bound to the house where the bereaved family was living. The widow was reading the Bible to her children but her grief was too fresh to gather comfort from it. When Dabney was flung into the room he grovelled at her feet and begged piteously for mercy. Her face did not soften but there was a kind of contempt in the settled sadness of her tone as she said It shall be as God directs. I will close this Bible open it at chance and when this boy shall put his finger at random on a line by that you must live or die.The book was opened and the child put his finger on a line That man shall die.Warner drew his knife and motioned his prisoner to the door. He was going to lead him into the wood to offer him as a sacrifice to his brothers spirit.No no shrieked the wretch. Give me one more chance one more Let the girl open the book.The woman coldly consents and when the book is opened for the second time she reads Love your enemies. There are no other words. The knife is used but it is to cut the prisoners bonds and he walks away with head hung down never more to take arms against his countrymen. And glad are they all at this when the husband is brought homenot dead though left among the corpses at Paoli but alive and certain of recovery with such nursing as his wife will give him. After tears of joy have been shed she tells him the story of the Bible judgment and all the members of the family fall on their knees in thanksgiving that the blood of Dabney is not upon their heads.
When the Plague desolates the country whole villages stand empty the cocks become hoarse and cannot crow even the dogs our household guardians no longer bark. They can however scent and see the Plague afar off. They growl and furiously try to attack it for the Plague delights to tease and worry them.A peasant once was asleep on the top of a hayrick near him leant a ladder. The moon shone brightly and the night was clear. Suddenly borne on the wind a great noise was heard in which the growling and howling of dogs rose distinctly above all other sounds.The peasant got up and saw with terror a tall woman clothed in white with dishevelled hair running straight towards him pursued by dogs. In front of her stood a high fence. The tall woman sprang clear over it at a bound and ran up the ladder. There secure from the furious dogs she put out her leg and teasing them criedNa goga noga Na goga noga There is my leg seize it.The peasant at once recognised in her the terrible Plague itself. He softly approached the ladder and pushed it off the rick with all his might. The Plague fell to the ground and the dogs seized her. She threatened the peasant with vengeance and then suddenly disappeared.The peasant did not die of the plague but he was never well afterwards and he would often involuntarily lift up his leg and repeat the cryNa goga noga Na goga nogaThese were the only words he could utter.
There was once a king who was so wicked that he would not allow any widows to live in his kingdom because he was certain that they had caused the death of their husbands nor would he admit of any fat man or woman as he was afraid that they would eat up everything in the kingdom.He was also very proud and arrogant and if any man happened to be taller than himself he would give him the choice of being lowered to a proper height by either having his head or his legs cut off.His subjects were so afraid of him and of his laws that the married women would not let their husbands go out of their sight lest any harm should happen to them and if they turned at all pale or had broken sleep or had lost their appetites they would nurse them night and day. So afraid were they of becoming widows that they always agreed with their husbands on all points lest by disagreeing they should bring about an attack of indigestion or something worse that might produce death.And when their children commenced to grow rapidly their fears were doubled lest they should become taller than the king for if they fed them on pudding which does not promote growth they incurred the danger of their becoming fat and if they fed them on meat so as to make them lean they would probably grow tall.It very soon became evident that there were more hunchbacks in that country than in any other for as soon as the children were approaching the forbidden height their parents would suspend heavy weights from their shoulders so that their backs became rounded and eventually humped.The young men when they were at an age to marry found it very difficult to get any woman to have them because they were afraid of becoming widows and also because so many of the men were humpbacked.But notwithstanding the kings wickedness it was admitted by the married men that their condition had considerably improved.There was a wide road made round the cities and towns on which all who were inclined to be stout both men and women would run until they were out of breath and jump over hurdles and there were so many of these people that the revenues of the Church commenced to suffer owing to the decreased demand for bulls as they willingly imposed long fasts on themselves.Now in the chief city of this country there was a very wise man well versed in the law and in concocting drugs for he was the public executioner and the chemist of the place. To him therefore went a deputation of the people to lay their grievances before him and after the spokesman had finished what he had to say the executioner looked very wise and after considering awhile he saidOur kings predecessor was held to be just and generous because he allowed every man to retain a fifth of his produce for the maintenance of his family and the tax he imposed on this fifth part was always readily paid. Here he touched the edge of his sharp axe and smiled and the deputation exclaimedQuite right so it was.Now the present king continued the wise man again feeling the edge of his axe has magnanimously increased your loyal tribute to him by one part in a hundred of the produce of the land and yet you are not satisfiedThe kings generosity we all feel said the deputation but if we may be allowed to express an opinion to you sir we wouldCertainly you may interrupted the man of drugs running his hand quickly over the axecertainly you may why should you notBy this time the chief spokesman had got behind the others and it was very evident that the members of the deputation were becoming aware that the logic of the executioner was too sharp for them.Seeing that they were all silent the executioner went on to say that the king had in his opinion been extremely considerate for he had by the law against widows contributed to the happiness and long life of the husbands and by enacting that no man should exceed a certain height or stoutness they had economized in many ways for they ate less and their clothes would cost them less. In fact he saw no reason for dissatisfaction but as they had come to him as a deputation he felt it to be his duty to place their supposed grievances before the king and he the executioner felt certain that the king would reply to them in a suitable manner. And having said this he raised the axe to the light to see that there was no notch on the edge which caused the deputation to tremble most violently and to assure the executioner that they were perfectly satisfied and desired to withdraw.The executioner however would not allow them to retirefor the grievances of a people should not be withheld from the kings ear but the members of the deputation became so frightened that they made their escape through the windows as fast as they could. And when the king heard all about it he remarked that Folly had entered with dignity by the door and Wisdom had unceremoniously escaped through the window.
RAVEN was traveling but he didnt know whence he came or whither he was going. As he journeyed along he was thinking How did I come to be alive Where did I come from Where am I going After traveling a long time he saw a smoke and going toward it saw four huntersblackbirds. Afraid to go near them he hid in the forest and watched.The next morning after the hunters had started away Raven crept up to their camp stole their meat carried it into the woods and made a camp for himself. He was lonely and he said I wish there were other people here. Looking around he saw a house west of his camp and going to it found Robin and his wife and five children. Raven ate the youngest child then ate the other four. The father and mother tried to drive him away but could not. When at last Raven went off he left old Rabin and his wife crying for their children.Sometime after this Raven saw a camp off in the southeast and going there found a family of Sparrows. He was afraid of the old people and he ran off but they followed him caught up and hit him on the head till they drove him far away.It is a shame to let such little people beat me thought Raven. But he was afraid to go back.Now Raven had gone far from his camp he hunted everywhere in the forest but couldnt find it. Well said he at last let it go I dont care and he walked away toward the North. Just before dark he found a camp and going towards it saw four men and a large quantity of meat. He hid in the forest and the next morning looking toward the camp he again saw the hunters.Ill wait till they go away thought Raven then Ill steal their meat. Soon he heard the men moving around then all was quiet and he knew that they had gone. He crept slowly toward the camp but when he reached it be didnt find even one bite of meatthey were the hunters from whom he had stolen before. They had finished hunting had packed their meat and started for home.Raven was disappointed. He walked on and toward night found another camp. Creeping near it he again saw the four hunters. He listened to what they were saying.One said I wonder who stole our meat that dayAnother said I think the thief is walking around in the woods I think his name is Raven.Oh thought Raven they are talking about me. They will be on the watch. How can I get their meat Then he said Let them fall asleep and sleep soundlyThat minute the four hunters fell asleep. Raven went up boldly took their meat carried it off into the woods and hid it saying This is the kind of man I amThe next morning the four hunters missed their meat.One said Somebody has stolen my meatAnother asked Who has stolen my meatThe third said I dreamed that I saw Raven around here and he started off toward the Southwest.Then the four said Let us follow the direction given by the dream.The hunters started to follow the thief. Soon they came to the place where he was camped. Raven had been out all night and now he was sleeping soundly.One of the men said We must kill him.No said another let him live he didnt kill us while we were asleep.They took their meat and went away.When Raven woke up he was very hungry but the meat was gone. Well thought he I must hunt for something to eat. He traveled around in every direction but found no game. About midday he heard the noise of people. He listened a while then went on till he came to a house. A man inside the house was singing and the song said Raven is coming Look out Be careful Raven is comingWhy does he sing about me thought Raven Ill go in and find out.He went into the house and found Groundbird and his wife and four children.I have come to stay a few days with you said Raven.Very well said the man.That night Raven ate the four children then he lay down and slept.The next morning the father and mother asked Where are our childrenRaven said I dreamed that a man came and carried your children off and my dream told me which way he went. I will go with you and hunt for them.When the three had traveled some distance Raven said The man who stole your children lives on that high cliff over there. I cant go there with you for I dont like that man. I will wait here till you come back.As soon as the father and mother were out of sight Raven ran off. He traveled till he came to where there were many of his own people. They were dancing and he sat down to watch them.Soon Muckworm was seen coming from the East. The people stopped dancing and ran in every direction but Muckworm pursued them and catching one after another by the neck he threw them aside dead.Raven who was watching thought What sort of man is that I wish he would see me. He cant throw me off dead in that way.Muckworm after killing many of the Raven people started toward the West Raven followed him. Muckworm kept on for a long time without seeming to know that there was anyone behind him but at last he stopped looked back and asked What do you wantI dont want anything said Raven Ive come to be company for you.I dont want company said Muckworm.Raven was frightened. Both men stood still for a minute then Muckworm sprang at Raven and caught him. He would have killed him but Raven screamed so loudly that many of his people heard the cry and came to his aid. They flew at Muckworm and pecked him to death.
Long long time ago the Laguna Indians used to live down by the ocean. One of the Indian men lived alone with his little daughter Thuntsay Sunlight. Thuntsay did not have a mother. Her father thought she was lonely so he brought a new mother to his house. This new mother had a little girl of her own Cohnnah Darkness. She did many nice things for her Cohnnah but she treated Thuntsay very unkindly. So Thuntsay used to run away from her stepmother down to the beach and make herself happy gathering shells and playing in the sand.One day she found a little fish that had been left in a pool of water on the sand when the tide went out.Thuntsay said the little fish I am hungry. Wont you please give me something to eatSo Thuntsay ran home and got bread crumbs for the little fish and every day for four days she fed him. On the fourth day he asked her Please throw me back into the ocean and I will give you a present.Thuntsay picked up the little fish and threw him back into the ocean and as she did so he said to her Go home and comb your hair and you will find my present.Thuntsay ran home as fast as she could and got her bunch of straw that she brushed and combed her hair with and began brushing it at once. And as she brushed all kind of beautiful things fell out. She was rich with gifts and she had plenty to share with her father.When her stepmother found out what had happened to Thuntsay she sent her own daughter Cohnnah down to the beach to look for the little fish so that he might give Cohnnah presents too.She found the little fish once more in a pool of water.Please give me some food Cohnnah asked the little fish for I am very hungry.But Cohnnah laughed and threw sand into the water. Then she went away and left the little fish.Next day Cohnnah went down to the beach where the little fish begged again for food and again she threw sand at him. He begged her on the third day and on the fourth day he said Please throw me back into the ocean and I will give you a present. Go home and comb your hair and you will find my present.Cohnnah picked him up quickly and threw him into the ocean. Then she ran home and told her mother Get my comb. The fish has promised me a present too. But when Cohnnah combed her hair it all fell out over the floor and there were no presents.Her mother was angry and she treated Thuntsay meaner than ever. So Thuntsay began to go to the beach again every day to get away from her stepmother.One day a big fish came up out of the water near her. Thuntsay he said I am the little fish that you fed. I have grown to be chief of the fishes now. Wont you come down into the ocean with me and be my bride I have beautiful things waiting for you.So Thuntsay jumped into the ocean and went down to live with the big FishChief. She lived happily with him for a long time until one day she grew homesick to see her father.Please let me go back home to see my father FishChief asked Thuntsay.All right you may go said FishChief and here are presents to take to him but you must promise me to come back again at the end of six months.I will come back replied Thuntsay so FishChief took her up to the shore and she went home.She found her father so sick from grieving over Thuntsays disappearance that even her stepmother was glad to have her return. Her father got well and Thuntsay was again so happy that she forgot all about her promise to FishChief.But one day as she was walking along the beach she saw poor FishChief lying on the sand almost dead. He was grieving himself to death. Thuntsay ran to him.I can not live without you Thuntsay. It is too lonely in my palace when you are gone. If you do not go back into the ocean with me I shall die. You may live with your father half of the time but if you do not come back to me for the other half I cannot live.So Thuntsay went back with FishChief and lived happily ever after spending half of the time in the Fish palace and half of the time with her father.
Once upon a time there lived a king who had but one son and he was called the Kindhearted. When the prince was twenty years old he asked the king his father to let him go traveling. His father fitted him out for the journey gave him a true servant to guard him and his fatherly blessing. The prince took leave of his father mounted a brave steed and went to different countries to see Gods world to learn many things and to return home a wiser and a better man.Once when the prince was slowly riding through a silent field he suddenly perceived an eagle in pursuit of a swan. The white swan was almost caught by the eagles sharp claws when the prince carefully aiming fired his pistol. The eagle fell dead and the happy swan came down and said Prince Kindhearted I thank you for your help. It is not a swan that is thanking you but the enchanted daughter of the Knight Invisible. You have not saved me from an eagles claws but from the terrible magician King Koshchey. My father will pay you well for your services. Remember whenever you are in need to say three times Knight Invisible come to my help The swan flew away as soon as it had finished speaking and the prince looked after it then continued his journey.He crossed many high mountains traversed deep rivers passed foreign countries and at last he came to a great desert where there was nothing to see but sky and sand. No man lived there no animals voice was ever heard no vegetable ever grew there the sun was shining so brightly and burning so terribly that all the rivers were dried up their beds were lost in the sand and there was not a drop of water anywhere. The young prince anxious to go everywhere and see everything and not noticing how dry things were kept going farther and farther and deeper and deeper into the desert. But after a while he became terribly thirsty. In order to find some water he sent his servant in one direction and he himself went in another. After a long time he succeeded in finding a well. He called to his servant I have found a means of getting some water and they both were happy. But their happiness did not last for the well was very deep and they had nothing with which to reach the water.The prince said to the servant Dismount I will let you down into the well by some long ropes and you shall draw up some water.No my prince answered the servant I am much heavier than you are and Your Majestys hands will not be able to hold me. You take hold of the ropes and I will let you down into the well.The prince the ropes tied around him went down into the well drank the cold water and taking some of it for the servant pulled the ropes as a sign for the servant to draw him up again.But instead of pulling him up the servant said Listen you kingly son From your cradledays until now you have lived a happy life surrounded by luxury and love and I have always led the life of a miserable wretch. Now you must agree to become my servant and I will be the prince instead of you. If you will not exchange say your last prayer for I am going to drown you.Do not drown me my true servant you will not gain anything by it. You will never find such a good master as I am and you know what a murderer may expect in the next world.Let me suffer in the next world but I will make you suffer in this one answered the servant and he began to loosen the ropes.Stop cried the prince I will be thy servant and you shall be the prince. I will give you my word for it.I do not believe your word. Swear that you will write down what you promise me now for words are lost in the air and writing always remains as a testimony against us.The servant let down into the well a sheet of paper and a pencil and told the prince to write the following The bearer of this is Prince Kindhearted traveling with his servant a subject of his fathers kingdom.The servant glanced over the note pulled the prince out of the well gave him his shabby clothes and put on the princes rich dress. Then having changed armor and horses they went on.In a week or so they came to the capital of a certain kingdom. When they approached the palace the false prince gave his horse to the false servant and told him to go to the stable and he himself went straight into the throne chamber and said to the king I come to you to ask for the hand of your daughter whose beauty and wisdom are known all over the world. If you consent you will have our favor if not we will decide it by war.You do not speak to me in a nice way at all not as a prince ought to speak but it may be that in your country you are not used to better manners. Now listen to me my future soninlaw. My kingdom is now in the hands of an enemy of mine. His troops have captured my best soldiers and now they are approaching my capital. If you will clear my kingdom from these troops my daughters hand will be yours as a reward.All right answered the false prince I will drive your enemies away. Do not worry if they come to the capital. Tomorrow morning not one enemy will be left in your land. In the evening he went out of the palace called his servant and said to him Listen my dear Go out to the city walls drive away the foreign troops and for this service I will return to you your note by which you denied your kingdom and swore to be my servant.The honest Prince Kindhearted put on his knightly armor mounted his steed went out to the city walls and called in a loud voice Knight Invisible Come to my helpHere I am said Knight Invisible what do you wish me to do for you I am ready to do everything for you because you saved my child from the terrible Koshchey.Prince Kindhearted showed him the troops and the Knight Invisible whistled loudly and called Oh you my wise horse come to me quicklyA wonderful horse appeared having a golden mane. Illustration by Ada Budell published in Stories to Read or Tell from Fairy Tales and Folklore by Laura Claire Foucher 1917 Moffat Yard and Company.There was a rustling in the air it thundered the earth trembled and a wonderful horse appeared having a golden mane from his nostrils a fire was burning from his eyes bright sparks were flying and from his ears thick clouds of smoke were coming.Knight Invisible jumped upon the horse and said to the prince Take this magic sword and attack the troops from the left and I upon my goldenmaned horse will attack them from the right.They both attacked the army. From the left the soldiers were falling like wood from the right like whole forests. In less than an hour the entire army vanished. Some of them remained upon the spot dead some of them fled. Prince Kindhearted and the Knight Invisible met upon the battlefield shook hands in a friendly way and in a minute the Knight Invisible and his horse turned into a bright red flame then into thick smoke which disappeared in the darkness. The prince returned quietly to the palace.The young princess felt very sad that evening. She could not sleep and so leaned out of her window whence she overheard the conversation between the prince and the servant. Then she saw what was going on behind the city walls. She also saw the Knight Invisible disappear in the darkness and Prince Kindhearted return to the palace. She saw the false prince coming out of the palace taking the knightly armor from the servant and Prince Kindhearted entering the stable to rest.The next morning the old king seeing his land freed from the enemies felt very happy and gave the prince many rich presents. But when he announced the engagement of his daughter to him she stood up took the hand of the real prince who helped to serve at the table led him before the old king and said My dearest father and king and all you that are present here This man is my bridegroom sent to me by God for he is your savior and the real prince. And that one who calls himself a prince is a traitor a false and dishonest man. Then the princess told everything she knew and said Let him show some proof that he really is a prince.The false prince gave to the king the note which was given to him in the well. The king opened it and read aloud The bearer of this note the false and untrue servant of Prince Kindhearted asks for pardon and expects a just punishment. The note was given to him in the well by Prince Kindhearted.Is it really so cried the wretch and he became pale as death.Yes read it yourself if you do not believe it answered the king.I cannot read said the poor fellow. He knelt before his master and begged for mercy but he received what he deserved.Prince Kindhearted and the princess were happily married and I was present at the wedding feast and also felt happy.
Once upon a time and a long long time ago it was there lived a widow who had a very pretty daughter. The mother good honest woman was quite content with her station in life. But with the daughter it was otherwise she like a spoilt beauty looked contemptuously upon her many admirers her mind was full of proud and ambitious thoughts and the more lovers she had the prouder she became.One beautiful moonlight night the mother awoke and being unable to sleep began to pray God for the happiness of her only child though she often made her mothers life miserable. The fond woman looked lovingly at the beautiful daughter sleeping by her side and she wondered as she saw her smile what happy dream had visited her. Then she finished her prayer and laying her head on the girls pillow fell asleep. Next day she said Come darling child tell me what you were dreaming about last night you looked so happy smiling in your sleep.Oh yes mother I remember. I had a very beautiful dream. I thought a rich nobleman came to our house in a splendid carriage of brass and gave me a ring set with stones that sparkled like the stars of heaven. When I entered the church with him it was full of people and they all thought me divine and adorable like the Blessed Virgin.Ah my child what sin May God keep you from such dreams.But the daughter ran away singing and busied herself about the house. The same day a handsome young farmer drove into the village in his cart and begged them to come and share his country bread. He was a kind fellow and the mother liked him much. But the daughter refused his invitation and insulted him into the bargain.Even if you had driven in a carriage of brass she said and had offered me a ring set with stones shining as the stars in heaven I would never have married youyou a mere peasantThe young farmer was terribly upset at her words and with a prayer for her soul returned home a saddened man. But her mother scolded and reproached her.The next night the woman again awoke and taking her rosary prayed with still greater fervour that God would bless her child. This time the girl laughed as she slept.What can the poor child be dreaming about she said to herself and sighing she prayed for her again. Then she laid her head upon her pillow and tried in vain to sleep. In the morning when her daughter was dressing she said Well my dear you were dreaming again last night and laughing like a maniac.Was I Listen I dreamt a nobleman came for me in a silver carriage and gave me a golden diadem. When I entered the church with him the people admired and worshipped me more than the Blessed Virgin.Ay me what a terrible dream what a wicked dream Pray God not to lead you into temptation.Then she scolded her daughter severely and went out slamming the door after her. That same day a carriage drove into the village and some gentlemen invited mother and daughter to share the bread of the lord of the manor. The mother considered such an offer a great honour but the daughter refused it and replied to the gentlemen scornfully Even if you had come to fetch me in a carriage of solid silver and had presented me with a golden diadem I would never have consented to be the wife of your lord.The gentlemen turned away in disgust and returned home the mother rebuked her severely for so much pride.Miserable foolish girl she cried pride is a breath from hell. It is your duty to be humble honest and sweettempered.The daughter replied by a laugh.The third night she slept soundly but the poor woman at her side could not close her eyes. Tormented with dark forebodings she feared some misfortune was about to happen and counted her beads praying fervently. All at once the young sleeper began to sneer and laugh.Merciful God ah me cried the poor woman what are these dreams that worry her poor brainIn the morning she said What made you sneer so frightfully last night You must have had bad dreams again my poor child.Now mother you look as if you were going to preach again.No no but I want to know what you were dreaming about.Well I dreamt some one drove up in a golden carriage and asked me to marry him and he brought me a mantle of cloth of pure gold. When we came into church the crowd pressed forward to kneel before me.The mother wrung her hands piteously and the girl left the room to avoid hearing her lamentations. That same day three carriages entered the yard one of brass one of silver and one of gold. The first was drawn by two the second by three the third by four magnificent horses. Gentlemen wearing scarlet gloves and green mantles got out of the brass and silver carriages while from the golden carriage alighted a prince who as the sun shone on him looked as if he were dressed in gold. They all made their way to the widow and asked for her daughters hand.I fear we are not worthy of so much honour replied the widow meekly but when the daughters eyes fell upon her suitor she recognised in him the lover of her dreams and withdrew to weave an aigrette of manycoloured feathers. In exchange for this aigrette which she offered her bridegroom he placed upon her finger a ring set with stones that shone like the stars in heaven and over her shoulders a mantle of cloth of gold. The young bride beside herself with joy retired to complete her toilette. Meanwhile the anxious mother a prey to the blackest forebodings said to her soninlaw My daughter has consented to share your bread tell me of what sort of flour it is madeIn our house we have bread of brass of silver and of gold my wife will be free to choose.Such a reply astonished her more than ever and made her still more unhappy. The daughter asked no questions was in fact content to know nothing not even what her mother suffered. She looked magnificent in her bridal attire and golden mantle but she left her home with the prince without saying goodbye either to her mother or to her youthful companions. Neither did she ask her mothers blessing though the latter wept and prayed for her safety.After the marriage ceremony they mounted the golden carriage and set off followed by the attendants of silver and brass. The procession moved slowly along the road without stopping until it reached the foot of a high rock. Here instead of a carriage entrance was a large cavern which led out into a steep slope down which the horses went lower and lower. The giant Zmotras he who makes the earthquakes closed the opening with a huge stone. They made their way in darkness for some time the terrified bride being reassured by her husband.Fear nothing said he in a little while it will be clear and beautiful.Grotesque dwarfs carrying lighted torches appeared on all sides saluted and welcomed their King Kovlad as they illumined the road for him and his attendants. Then for the first time the girl knew she had married Kovlad but this mattered little to her. On coming out from these gloomy passages into the open they found themselves surrounded by large forests and mountains mountains that seemed to touch the sky. And strange to relate all the trees of whatsoever kind and even the mountains that seemed to touch the sky were of solid lead. When they had crossed these marvellous mountains the giant Zmotras closed all the openings in the road they had passed. They then drove out upon vast and beautiful plains in the centre of which was a golden palace covered with precious stones. The bride was weary with looking at so many wonders and gladly sat down to the feast prepared by the dwarfs. Meats of many kinds were served roast and boiled but lo they were of metalbrass silver and gold. Every one ate heartily and enjoyed the food but the young wife with tears in her eyes begged for a piece of bread.Certainly madam with pleasure answered Kovlad. But she could not eat the bread which was brought for it was of brass. Then the king sent for a piece of silver bread still she could not eat it and again for a slice of golden bread that too she was unable to bite. The servants did all they could to get something to their mistresss taste but she found it impossible to eat anything.I should be most happy to gratify you said Kovlad but we have no other kind of food.Then she realised for the first time in whose power she had placed herself and she began to weep bitterly and wish she had taken her mothers advice.It is of no use to weep and regret said Kovlad you must have known the kind of bread you would have to break here your wish has been fulfilled.And so it was for nothing can recall the past. The wretched girl was obliged henceforth to live underground with her husband Kovlad the God of Metals in his golden palace. And this because she had set her heart upon nothing but the possession of gold and had never wished for anything better.
There was once an old castle that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl or crept about the country like a cat but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle he became quite fixed and could not move a step till she came and set him free which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird and the fairy put her into a cage and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle and all with beautiful birds in them.Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before and a shepherd lad whose name was Jorindel was very fond of her and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood that they might be alone and Jorindel said We must take care that we dont go too near to the fairys castle.It was a beautiful evening the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath and the turtledoves sang from the tall birches. Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun Jorindel sat by her side and both felt sad they knew not why but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way and when they looked to see which way they should go home they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.The sun was setting fast and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him and saw through the bushes that they had without knowing it sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear turned pale and trembled. Jorinda was just singingThe ringdove sang from the willow spray Welladay welladayHe mournd for the fate of his darling mate Welladaywhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale so that her song ended with a mournful jug jug. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them and three times screamedTu whu Tu whu Tu whuJorindel could not move he stood fixed as a stone and could neither weep nor speak nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down the gloomy night came the owl flew into a bush and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre with staring eyes and a nose and chin that almost met one another.She mumbled something to herself seized the nightingale and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gonebut what could he do he could not speak he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voiceTill the prisoner is fastAnd her doom is cast There stay Oh stayWhen the charm is around herAnd the spell has bound her Hie away awayOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda but she laughed at him and said he should never see her again then she went her way.He prayed he wept he sorrowed but all in vain. Alas he said what will become of me He could not go back to his own home so he went to a strange village and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go but all in vain he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl and he dreamt that he plucked the flower and went with it in his hand into the castle and that every thing he touched with it was disenchanted and that there he found his Jorinda again.In the morning when he awoke he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower and eight long days he sought for it in vain but on the ninth day early in the morning he found the beautiful purple flower and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower and set out and travelled day and night till he came again to the castle.He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it and yet he did not become fixed as before but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower and it sprang open so that he went in through the court and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry and screamed with rage but she could not come within two yards of him for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds but alas there were many many nightingales and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda While he was thinking what to do he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her touched the cage with the flower and his Jorinda stood before him and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.Then he touched all the other birds with the flower so that they all took their old forms again and he took Jorinda home where they were married and lived happily together many years and so did a good many other lads whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairys cages by themselves much longer than they liked.
Once upon a time there was a prince who studied and racked his brains so much that he learned magic and the art of finding hidden treasures. One day he discovered a treasure in a bank let us say the bank of Ddisisa Oh he says now I am going to get it out. But to get it out it was necessary that ten million million ants should cross one by one the river Gianquadara let us suppose it was that one in a bark made of the half shell of a nut. The prince puts the bark in the river and begins to make the ants pass over. One two threeand he is still doing it.Here the person who is telling the story pauses and says We will finish this story when the ants have finished passing over.
There was a king in a land not far from Greece who had two daughters and the younger was fairer than the elder daughter.This old king made a match between the king of Greece and his own elder daughter but he kept the younger one hidden away till after the marriage. Then the younger daughter came forth to view and when the king of Greece saw her he wouldnt look at his own wife. Nothing would do him but to get the younger sister and leave the elder at home with her father.The king wouldnt listen to this wouldnt agree to the change so the king of Greece left his wife where she was went home alone in a terrible rage and collected all his forces to march against the kingdom of his fatherinlaw.He soon conquered the king and his army and so far as he was able he vexed and tormented him. To do this the more completely he took from him a rod of Druidic spells enchantment and ring of youth which he had and striking the elder sister with the rod he said You will be a serpent of the sea and live outside there in the bay by the castle.Then turning to the younger sister whose name was Gil an Og he struck her and said Youll be a cat while inside this castle and have your own form only when you are outside the walls.After he had done this the king of Greece went home to his own country taking with him the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth. The king died in misery and grief leaving his two daughters spellbound.Now there was a Druid in that kingdom and the younger sister went to consult him and asked Shall I ever be released from the enchantment thats on me nowYou will not unless you find the man to release you and there is no man in the world to do that but a champion who is now with Fin MacCumhail in Erin.Well how can I find that man asked she.I will tell you said the Druid. Do you make a shirt out of your own hair take it with you and never stop till you land in Erin and find Fin and his men the man that the shirt will fit is the man who will release you.She began to make the shirt and worked without stopping till it was finished. Then she went on her journey and never rested till she came to Erin in a ship. She went on shore and inquired where Fin and his men were to be found at that time of the year.You will find them at Knock an Ar was the answer she got.She went to Knock an Ar carrying the shirt with her. The first man she met was Conan Maol and she said to him I have come to find the man this shirt will fit. From the time one man tries it all must try till I see the man it fits.The shirt went from hand to hand till Cuclin put it on. Well said she it fits as your own skin.Now Gil an Og told Cuclin all that had happenedhow her father had forced her sister to marry the king of Greece how this king had made war on her father enchanted her sister and herself and carried off the rod of enchantment with the ring of youth and how the old Druid said the man this shirt would fit was the only man in the world who could release them.Now Gil an Og and Cuclin went to the ship and sailed across the seas to her country and went to her castle.Youll have no one but a cat for company tonight said Gil an Og. I have the form of a cat inside this castle but outside I have my own appearance. Your dinner is ready go in.After the dinner Cuclin went to another room apart and lay down to rest after the journey. The cat came to his pillow sat there and purred till he fell asleep and slept soundly till morning.When he rose up a basin of water and everything he needed was before him and his breakfast ready. He walked out after breakfast Gil an Og was on the green outside before him and saidIf you are not willing to free my sister and myself I shall not urge you but if you do free us I shall be glad and thankful. Many kings sons and champions before you have gone to recover the ring and the rod but they have never come back.Well whether I thrive or not Ill venture said Cuclin.I will give you said Gil an Og a present such as I have never given before to any man who ventured out on my behalf I will give you the speckled boat.Cuclin took leave of Gil an Og and sailed away in the speckled boat to Greece where he went to the kings court and challenged him to combat.The king of Greece gathered his forces and sent them out to chastise Cuclin. He killed them all to the last man. Then Cuclin challenged the king a second time.I have no one now to fight but myself said the king and I dont think it becomes me to go out and meet the like of you.If you dont come out to me said Cuclin Ill go in to you and cut the head off you in your own castle.Thats enough of impudence from you you scoundrel said the king of Greece. I wont have you come into my castle but Ill meet you on the open plain.The king went out and they fought till Cuclin got the better of him bound him head and heels and said Ill cut the head off you now unless you give me the ring of youth and the rod of enchantment that you took from the father of Gil an Og.Well I did carry them away said the king but it wouldnt be easy for me now to give them to you or to her for there was a man who came and carried them away who could take them from you and from me and from as many more of us if they were here.Who was that man asked Cuclin.His name said the king is Lug Longhand. And if I had known what you wanted there would have been no difference between us. Ill tell you how I lost the ring and rod and Ill go with you and show you where Lug Longhand lives. But do you come to my castle. Well have a good time together.They set out next day and never stopped till they came opposite Lug Longhand castle and Cuclin challenged his forces to combat.I have no forces said Lug but Ill fight you myself. So the combat began and they spent the whole day at one another and neither gained the victory.The king of Greece himself put up a tent on the green in front of the castle and prepared everything necessary to eat and drink there was no one else to do it. After breakfast next day Cuclin and Lug began fighting again. The king of Greece looked on as the day before.They fought the whole day till near evening when Cuclin got the upper hand of Lug Longhand and bound him head and heels saying Ill cut the head off you now unless you give me the rod and the ring that you carried away from the king of Greece.Oh then said Lug it would be hard for me to give them to you or to him for forces came and took them from me and they would have taken them from you and from him if you had been here.Who in the world took them from you asked the king of Greece.Release me from this bond and come to my castle and Ill tell you the whole story said Lug Longhand.Cuclin released him and they went to the castle. They got good reception and entertainment from Lug that night and the following morning as well. He said The ring and the rod were taken from me by the knight of the island of the Flood. This island is surrounded by a chain and there is a ring of fire seven miles wide between the chain and the castle. No man can come near the island without breaking the chain and the moment the chain is broken the fire stops burning at that place and the instant the fire goes down the knight rushes out and attacks and slays every man thats before him. The king of Greece Cuclin and Lug Longhand now sailed on in the speckled boat towards the island of the Flood. On the following morning when the speckled boat struck the chain she was thrown back three days sail and was near being sunk and would have gone to the bottom of the sea but for her own goodness and strength.As soon as Cuclin saw what had happened he took the oars rowed on again and drove the vessel forward with such venom that she cut through the chain and went one third of her length on to dry land. That moment the fire was quenched where the vessel struck and when the knight of the Island saw the fire go out he rushed to the shore and met Cuclin the king of Greece and Lug Longhand.When Cuclin saw him he threw aside his weapons caught him raised him above his head hurled him down on the flat of his back bound him head and heels and said Ill cut the head off you unless you give me the ring and the rod that you carried away from Lug Longhand.I took them from him its true said the knight but it would be hard for me to give them to you now for a man came and took them from me who would have taken them from you and all that are with you and as many more if they had been here before him.Who in the world could that man be asked Cuclin.The Dark Gruagach of the Northern Island. Release me and come to my castle. Ill tell you all and entertain you well.He took them to his castle gave them good cheer and told them all about the Gruagach and his island. Next morning all sailed away in Cuclins vessel which they had left at the shore of the island and never stopped till they came to the Gruagachs castle and pitched their tents in front of it.Then Cuclin challenged the Gruagach. The others followed after to know would he thrive. The Gruagach came out and faced Cuclin and they began and spent the whole day at one another and neither of them gained the upper hand. When evening came they stopped and prepared for supper and the night.Next day after breakfast Cuclin challenged the Gruagach again and they fought till evening when Cuclin got the better in the struggle disarmed the Gruagach bound him and said Unless you give up the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth that you took from the knight of the island of the Flood Ill cut the head off you now.I took them from him tis true but there was a man named ThininIron who took them from me and he would have taken them from you and from me and all that are here if there were twice as many. He is such a man that sword cannot cut him fire cannot burn him water cannot drown him and tis no easy thing to get the better of him. But if youll free me now and come to my castle Ill treat you well and tell you all about him. Cuclin agreed to this.Next morning they would not stop nor be satisfied till they went their way. They found the castle of ThininIron and Cuclin challenged him to combat. They fought and he was cutting the flesh from Cuclin but Cuclins sword cut no flesh from him. They fought till Cuclin said It is time now to stop till tomorrow.Cuclin was scarcely able to reach the tent. They had to support him and put him to bed. Now who should come to Cuclin that night but Gil an Og and she said You have gone further than any man before you and Ill cure you now and you need go no further for the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth.Well said Cuclin Ill never give over till I knock another days trial out of ThininIron.When it was time for rest Gil an Og went away and Cuclin fell asleep for himself. On the following morning all his comrades were up and facing his tent. They thought to see him dead but he was in as good health as ever.They prepared breakfast and after breakfast Cuclin went before the door of the castle to challenge his enemy.ThininIron thrust his head out and said That man I fought yesterday has come again today. It would have been a good deed if I had cut the head off him last night. Then he wouldnt be here to trouble me this morning. I wont come home this day till I bring his head with me. Then Ill have peace.They met in combat and fought till the night was coming. Then ThininIron cried out for a cessation and if he did Cuclin was glad to give it for his sword had no effect upon ThininIron except to tire and nearly kill him he was enchanted and no arms could cut him. When ThininIron went to his castle he threw up three sups of blood and said to his housekeeper Though his sword could not penetrate me he has nearly broken my heart.Cuclin had to be carried to his tent. His comrades laid him on his bed and said Whoever came and healed him yesterday may be the same will be here tonight. They went away and were not long gone when Gil an Og came and said Cuclin if you had done my bidding you wouldnt be as you are tonight. But if you neglect my words now youll never see my face again. Ill cure you this time and make you as well as ever and whatever virtue she had she healed him so he was as strong as before.Oh then said Cuclin whatever comes on me Ill never turn back till I knock another days trial out of ThininIron.Well said she you are a stronger man than he but there is no good in working at him with a sword. Throw your sword aside tomorrow and youll get the better of him and bind him. Youll not see me again.She went away and he fell asleep. His comrades came in the morning and found him sleeping. They got breakfast and after eating Cuclin went out and called a challenge.Oh tis the same man as yesterday said ThininIron and if I had cut the head off him then it wouldnt be he that would trouble me today. If I live for it Ill bring his head in my hand tonight and hell never disturb me again.When Cuclin saw ThininIron coming he threw his sword aside and facing him caught him by the body raised him up then dashed him to the ground and said If you dont give me what I want Ill cut the head off you.What do you want of me asked ThininIron.I want the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth you carried from the Gruagach.I did indeed carry them from him but it would be no easy thing for me to give them to you or any other man for a force came which took them from me.What could take them from you asked Cuclin.The queen of the Wilderness an old hag that has them now. But release me from this bondage and Ill take you to my castle and entertain you well and Ill go with you and the rest of the company to see how will you thrive.So he took Cuclin and his friends to the castle and entertained them joyously and he said The old hag the queen of the Wilderness lives in a round tower which is always turning on wheels. There is but one entrance to the tower and that high above the ground and in the one chamber in which she lives keeping the ring and the rod is a chair and she has but to sit on the chair and wish herself in any part of the world and that moment she is there. She has six lines of guards protecting her tower and if you pass all of these youll do what no man before you has done to this day. The first guards are two lions that rush out to know which of them will get the first bite out of the throat of any one that tries to pass. The second are seven men with iron hurlies and an iron ball and with their hurlies they wallop the life out of any man that goes their way. The third is HungupNaked who hangs on a tree with his toes to the earth his head cut from his shoulders and lying on the ground and who kills every man who comes near him. The fourth is the bull of the Mist that darkens the woods for seven miles around and destroys everything that enters the Mist. The fifth are seven cats with poison tails and one drop of their poison would kill the strongest man.Next morning all went with Cuclin as far as the lions who guarded the queen of the Wilderness an old hag made young by the ring of youth. The two lions ran at Cuclin to see which would have the first bite out of him.Cuclin wore a red silk scarf around his neck and had a fine head of hair. He cut the hair off his head and wound it around one hand took his scarf and wrapped it around the other. Then rushing at the lions he thrust a hand down the throat of each lion for lions can bite neither silk nor hair. He pulled the livers and lights out of the two and they fell dead before him. His comrades looking on said Youll thrive now since you have done this deed and they left him and went home each to his own country.Cuclin went further. The next people he met were the seven men with the iron hurlies ball clubs and they said Tis long since any man walked this way to us well have sport now.The first one said Give him a touch of the hurly and let the others do the same and well wallop him till he is dead.Now Cuclin drew his sword and cut the head off the first man before he could make an offer of the hurly at him and then he did the same to the other six.He went on his way till he came to HungupNaked who was hanging from a tree his head on the ground near him. The queen of the Wilderness had fastened him to the tree because he wouldnt marry her and she said If any man comes who will put your head on you youll be free. And she laid the injunction on him to kill every man who tried to pass his way without putting the head on him.Cuclin went up looked at him and saw heaps of bones around the tree. The body said You cant go by here. I fight with every man who tries to pass.Well Im not going to fight with a man unless he has a head on him. Take your head. And Cuclin picking up the head clapped it on the body and said Now Ill fight with youThe man said Im all right now. I know where you are going. Ill stay here till you come if you conquer youll not forget me. Take the head off me now put it where you found it and if you succeed remember that I shall be here before you on your way home.Cuclin went on but soon met the bull of the Mist that covered seven miles of the wood with thick mist. When the bull saw him he made at him and stuck a horn in his ribs and threw him three miles into the wood against a great oak tree and broke three ribs in his side.Well said Cuclin when he recovered if I get another throw like that Ill not be good for much exercise. He was barely on his feet when the bull was at him again but when he came up he caught the bull by both horns and away they went wrestling and struggling. For three days and nights Cuclin kept the bull in play till the morning of the fourth day when he put him on the flat of his back. Then he turned him on the side and putting a foot on one horn and taking the other in his two hands he said Tis well I earned you there is not a stitch on me that isnt torn to rags from wrestling with you. He pulled the bull asunder from his horns to his tail into two equal parts and said Now that I have you in two its in quarters Ill put you. He took his sword and when he struck the backbone of the bull the sword remained in the bone and he couldnt pull it out.He walked away and stood awhile and looked. Tis hard to say said he that any good champion would leave his sword behind him. So he went back and made another pull and took the hilt off his sword leaving the blade in the back of the bull. Then he went away tattered and torn the hilt in his hand and he turned up towards the forge of the Strong Smith. One of the Smiths boys was out for coal at the time he saw Cuclin coming with the hilt in his hand and ran in saying There is a man coming up and he looks like a fool well have funHold your tongue said the master. Have you heard any account of the bull of the Mist these three daysWe have not said the boys.Perhaps said the Strong Smith thats a good champion thats coming and do you mind yourselves.At that moment Cuclin walked in to the forge where twelve boys and the master were working. He saluted them and asked Can you put a blade in this hiltWe can said the master. They put in the blade. Cuclin raised the sword and took a shake out of it and broke it to bits.This is a rotten blade said he. Go at it again.They made a second blade. The boys were in dread of him now. He broke the second blade in the same way as the first. They made six blades one stronger than the other. He did the same to them all. There is no use in talking said the Strong Smith we have no stuff that would make a right blade for you. Go down now said he to two of the boys and bring up an old sword thats down in the stable full of rust.They went and brought up the sword on two handspikes between them it was so heavy that one couldnt carry it. They gave it to Cuclin and with one blow on his heel he knocked the dust from it and went out at the door and took a shake out of it and if he did he darkened the whole place with the rust from the blade.This is my sword whoever made it said he.It is said the master its yours and welcome. I know who you are now and where you are going. Remember that Im in bondage here. The Strong Smith took Cuclin then to his house gave him refreshment and clothes for the journey. When he was ready the Smith said I hope youll thrive. You have done a deal more than any man that ever walked this way before. There is nothing now to stand in your way till you come to the seven cats outside the turning tower. If they shake their tails and a drop of poison comes on you it will penetrate to your heart. You must sweep off their tails with your sword. Tis equal to you what their bodies will do after that.Cuclin soon came to them and there wasnt one of the seven cats he didnt strip of her tail before she knew he was in it. He cared nothing for the bodies so he had the tails. The cats ran away.Now he faced the tower turning on wheels. The queen of the Wilderness was in it. He had been told by ThininIron that he must cut the axle. He found the axle cut it and the tower stopped that instant. Cuclin made a spring and went in through the single passage.The old hag was preparing to sit on the chair as she saw him coming. He sprang forward pushed the chair away with one hand and catching her by the back of the neck with the other said You are to lose your head now old womanSpare me and what you want youll get said she. I have the ring of youth and the rod of enchantment and she gave them to him. He put the ring on his finger and saying Youll never do mischief again to man he turned her face to the entrance and gave her a kick. Out she flew through the opening and down to the ground where she broke her neck and died on the spot.Cuclin made the Strong Smith king over all the dominions of the queen of the Wilderness and proclaimed that any person in the country who refused to obey the new king would be put to death.Cuclin turned back at once and travelled till he came to HungupNaked. He took him down and putting the head on his body struck him a blow of the rod and made the finest looking man of him that could be found. The man went back to his own home happy and well.Cuclin never stopped till he came to the castle of Gil an Og. She was outside with a fine welcome before him and why not to be sure for he had the rod of enchantment and the ring of youthWhen she entered the castle and took the form of a cat he struck her a blow of the rod and she gained the same form and face she had before the king of Greece struck her. Then he asked Where is your sister In the lake there outside answered Gil an Og in the form of a seaserpent. She went out with him and the moment they came to the edge of the lake the sister rose up near them. Then Cuclin struck her with the rod and she came to land in her own shape and countenance.Next day they saw a deal of vessels facing the harbor and what should they be but a fleet of ships and on the ships were the king of Greece Lug Longhand the knight of the island of the Flood the Dark Guagach of the Northern Island and ThininIron and they came each in his own vessel to know was there any account of Cuclin. There was good welcome for them all and when they had feasted and rejoiced together Cuclin married Gil an Og. The king of Greece took Gil an Ogs sister who was his own wife at first and went home.Cuclin went away himself with his wife Gil an Og never stopping till he came to Erin and when he came Fin MacCumhail and his men were at KilConaly near the river Shannon.When Cuclin went from Erin he left a son whose mother was called the Virago of Alba she was still alive and the son was eighteen years old. When she heard that Cuclin had brought Gil an Og to Erin she was enraged with jealousy and madness. She had reared the son whose name was Conln like any kings son and now giving him his arms of a champion she told him to go to his father.I would said he if I knew who my father is.His name is Cuclin and he is with Fin MacCumhail. I bind you not to yield to any man said she to her son nor tell your name to any man till you fight him out.Conln started from Ulster where his mother was and never stopped till he was facing Fin and his men who were hunting that day along the cliffs of KilConaly.When the young man came up Fin said There is a single man facing us.Conan Maol said Let some one go against him ask who he is and what he wants.I never give an account of myself to any man said Conln till I get an account from him.There is no man among us said Conan bound in that way but Cuclin. They called on Cuclin he came up and the two fought. Conln knew by the description his mother had given that Cuclin was his father but Cuclin did not know his son. Every time Conln aimed his spear he threw it so as to strike the ground in front of Cuclins toe but Cuclin aimed straight at him.They were at one another three days and three nights. The son always sparing the father the father never sparing the son.Conan Maol came to them the fourth morning. Cuclin said he I didnt expect to see any man standing against you three days and you such a champion.When Conln heard Conan Maol urging the father to kill him he gave a bitter look at Conan and forgot his guard. Cuclins spear went through his head that minute and he fell. I die of that blow from my father said he.Are you my son said Cuclin.I am said Conln.Cuclin took his sword and cut the head off him sooner than leave him in the punishment and pain he was in. Then he faced all the people and Fin was looking on.Theres trouble on Cuclin said Fin. Chew your thumb said Conan Maol to know whats on him.Fin chewed his thumb and said Cuclin is after killing his own son and if I and all my men were to face him before his passion cools at the end of seven days hed destroy every man of us.Go now said Conan and bind him to go down to Bale strand and give seven days fighting against the waves of the sea rather than kill us all.So Fin bound him to go down. When he went to Bale strand Cuclin found a great white stone. He grasped his sword in his right hand and cried out If I had the head of the woman who sent her son into peril of death at my hand Id split it as I split this stone and he made four quarters of the stone. Then he strove with the waves seven days and nights till he fell from hunger and weakness and the waves went over him.
Once upon a time  so long ago that the world has forgotten the date  in a city of the North of Europe  the name of which is so hard to pronounce that no one remembers it  there was a little boy just seven years old whose name was Wolff. He was an orphan and lived with his aunt a hardhearted avaricious old woman who never kissed him but once a year on New Years Day and who sighed with regret every time she gave him a bowlful of soup.The poor little boy was so sweettempered that he loved the old woman in spite of her bad treatment but he could not look without trembling at the wart decorated with four gray hairs which grew on the end of her nose.As Wolffs aunt was known to have a house of her own and a woolen stocking full of gold she did not dare to send her nephew to the school for the poor. But she wrangled so that the schoolmaster of the rich boys school was forced to lower his price and admit little Wolff among his pupils. The bad schoolmaster was vexed to have a boy so meanly clad and who paid so little and he punished little Wolff severely without cause ridiculed him and even incited against him his comrades who were the sons of rich citizens. They made the orphan their drudge and mocked at him so much that the little boy was as miserable as the stones in the street and hid himself away in corners to cry  when the Christmas season came.On the Eve of the great Day the schoolmaster was to take all his pupils to the midnight mass and then to conduct them home again to their parents houses.Now as the winter was very severe and a quantity of snow had fallen within the past few days the boys came to the place of meeting warmly wrapped up with furlined caps drawn down over their ears padded jackets gloves and knitted mittens and good strong shoes with thick soles. Only little Wolff presented himself shivering in his thin everyday clothes and wearing on his feet socks and wooden shoes.His naughty comrades tried to annoy him in every possible way but the orphan was so busy warming his hands by blowing on them and was suffering so much from chilblains that he paid no heed to the taunts of the others. Then the band of boys marching two by two started for the parish church.It was comfortable inside the church which was brilliant with lighted tapers. And the pupils made lively by the gentle warmth the sound of the organ and the singing of the choir began to chatter in low tones. They boasted of the midnight treats awaiting them at home. The son of the Mayor had seen before leaving the house a monstrous goose larded with truffles so that it looked like a blackspotted leopard. Another boy told of the fir tree waiting for him on the branches of which hung oranges sugarplums and punchinellos. Then they talked about what the Christ Child would bring them or what he would leave in their shoes which they would certainly be careful to place before the fire when they went to bed. And the eyes of the little rogues lively as a crowd of mice sparkled with delight as they thought of the many gifts they would find on waking  the pink bags of burnt almonds the bonbons lead soldiers standing in rows menageries and magnificent jumpingjacks dressed in purple and gold.Little Wolff alas knew well that his miserly old aunt would send him to bed without any supper but as he had been good and industrious all the year he trusted that the Christ Child would not forget him so he meant that night to set his wooden shoes on the hearth.The midnight mass was ended. The worshipers hurried away anxious to enjoy the treats awaiting them in their homes. The band of pupils two by two following the schoolmaster passed out of the church.Now under the porch seated on a stone bench in the shadow of an arched niche was a child asleep  a little child dressed in a white garment and with bare feet exposed to the cold. He was not a beggar for his dress was clean and new and  beside him upon the ground tied in a cloth were the tools of a carpenters apprentice.Under the light of the stars his face with its closed eyes shone with an expression of divine sweetness and his soft curling blond hair seemed to form an aureole of light about his forehead. But his tender feet blue with the cold on this cruel night of December were pitiful to seeThe pupils so warmly clad and shod passed with indifference before the unknown child. Some the sons of the greatest men in the city cast looks of scorn on the barefooted one. But little Wolff coming last out of the church stopped deeply moved before the beautiful sleeping child.Alas said the orphan to himself how dreadful This poor little one goes without stockings in weather so cold And what is worse he has no shoe to leave beside him while he sleeps so that the Christ Child may place something in it to comfort him in all his misery.And carried away by his tender heart little Wolff drew off the wooden shoe from his right foot placed it before the sleeping child and as best as he was able now hopping now limping and wetting his sock in the snow he returned to his aunt.You goodfornothing cried the old woman full of rage as she saw that one of his shoes was gone. What have you done with your shoe little beggarLittle Wolff did not know how to lie and though shivering with terror as he saw the gray hairs on the end of her nose stand upright he tried stammering to tell his adventure.But the old miser burst into frightful laughter. Ah the sweet young master takes off his shoe for a beggar Ah master spoils a pair of shoes for a barefoot This is something new indeed Ah well since things are so I will place the shoe that is left in the fireplace and tonight the Christ Child will put in a rod to whip you when you wake. And tomorrow you shall have nothing to eat but water and dry bread and we shall see if the next time you will give away your shoe to the first vagabond that comes along.And saying this the wicked woman gave him a box on each ear and made him climb to his wretched room in the loft. There the heartbroken little one lay down in the darkness and drenching his pillow with tears fell asleep.But in the morning when the old woman awakened by the cold and shaken by her cough descended to the kitchen oh wonder of wondersShe saw the great fireplace filled with bright toys magnificent boxes of sugarplums riches of all sorts and in front of all this treasure the wooden shoe which her nephew had given to the vagabond standing beside the other shoe which she herself had placed there the night before intending to put in it a handful of switches.And as little Wolff who had come running at the cries of his aunt stood in speechless delight before all the splendid Christmas gifts there came great shouts of laughter from the street.The old woman and the little boy went out to learn what it was all about and saw the gossips gathered around the public fountain. What could have happened Oh a most amusing and extraordinary thing The children of all the rich men of the city whose parents wished to surprise them with the most beautiful gifts had found nothing but switches in their shoesThen the old woman and little Wolff remembered with alarm all the riches that were in their own fireplace but just then they saw the pastor of the parish church arriving with his face full of perplexity.Above the bench near the church door in the very spot where the night before a child dressed in white with bare feet exposed to the great cold had rested his sleeping head the pastor had seen a golden circle wrought into the old stones. Then all the people knew that the beautiful sleeping child beside whom had lain the carpenters tools was the Christ Child himself and that he had rewarded the faith and charity of little Wolff.
Once upon a time some Dutch hunters went to Africa hoping to capture a whole family of lions. In this they succeeded. With a pack of hounds and plenty of aborigines to poke the jungle with sticks they drove a big male lion with his wife and four whelps out of the undergrowth into a circle. In the centre they had dug a pit and covered it over with sticks and grass. Into this the whole lion family tumbled. Then by nets and ropes the big fierce creatures and the little cubs were lifted out. They were put in cages and brought to Holland. The baby lions no bigger than pug dogs were as pretty and harmless as kittens. The sailors delighted to play with them.Now lions even before one was ever seen among the Dutch enjoyed a great reputation for strength courage dignity and power. It was believed that they had all the traits of character supposed to belong to kings and which boys like to possess. Many fathers had named their sons Leo which is Latin for lion. Dutch daddies had their baby boys christened with the name of Leeuw which is their word for the king of beasts.Before lions were brought from the hot countries into colder lands the bear and wolf were most admired because besides possessing plenty of fur as well as great claws and terrible teeth they had great courage. For these reasons many royal and common folks had taken the wolf and bear as namesakes for their hopeful sons.But the male lion could make more noise than wolves for he could roar while they could only howl. He had a shaggy mane and a very long tail. This had a nail at the end for scratching and combing out his hair when tangled up. If he were angry the mighty brute could stick out his red tongue curled like a pump handle and nearly half a yard long.So the lion was called the king of beasts and the crowned rulers and knights took him as their emblem. They had pictures of the huge creature painted on their flags shields and armor. Sometimes they stuck a gold or brass lion on their iron war hats which they called helmets. No knight was allowed to have more than one lion on his shield but kings might have three or four or even a whole menagerie of meateating creatures. These painted or sculptured lions were in all sorts of action running walking standing up and looking behind or before.Now there was a Dutch artist who noticed what funny fellows kings were and how they liked to have all sorts of beasts and birds of prey and sea creatures that devour on their banners. There were dragons twoheaded eagles boars with tusks serpents with fangs hawks griffins wyverns lions dragons and dragonlions besides horses with wings mermaids with scaly tails and even night mares that went flying through the dark. With such a funny variety of beast bird and fish some wondered why there were not cows with two tails cats with two noses rams with four horns and creatures that were half veal and half mutton. He noticed that kings did not care much for tame quiet peaceable or useful creatures such as oxen or horses doves or sheep but only for those brutes that hunt and kill the more defenceless creatures.Since then kings of the country must have a lion the artist resolved to make a new one. He would have some fun at any rate.So as painter or sculptor select men and women to pose for them in their study as their heroes and heroines and just as they picture plump little boys and girls as cherubs and angels so the Dutchman would make of the cubs and the father beast of prey his models for coats of arms.Poor lions They did not know but they soon found out how tiresome it was to pose. They must hold their paws up down sideways or behind according as they were told. They must stand or kneel for a long time in awkward positions. They must stick out their tongues to full length walk on their hind legs twist their necks to one side or the other look forward or backward and in many tiresome ways do just as they were ordered. They must also make of their tails every sort of use whether to wrap around posts or bundles to stick out of their cage or put between their legs as they ran away or to whisk them around as they roared or hoist them up high when rampant.In some cases they were expected even to put on spectacles and pretend to be reading to hold in their paws books and scrolls or town arms or shop signs. They must pose not only as companions of Daniel in the lions den at Babylon which was proper but also to sit as companion of St. Mark and even to stand on their legs on the top of a high column without falling off.In a word this artist belonged to the college of heralds and he introduced the king of beasts into Dutch heraldry.So from that day forth the life of that family of African lions from the daddy to the youngest cub was made a burden. When at home in the jungle and even in the cage the father lions favorite position was that of lolling on one side with his paws stretched out and half asleep and all day until he went out towards dark to hunt. Now he must stand up nearly all day. Daddy lion had to do most of the posing until the poor beasts front legs and paws were weary with standing so long. Moreover the hair was all worn off his body at the place where he had to sit on the hard wooden floor. He must do all this on penalty of being punched with a red hot poker if he refused. A charcoal furnace and long andirons were kept near by and these were attended to by a Dutch boy. Or it might be that the whole family of lions were not allowed to have any dinner till Daddy obeyed and did what he was told though often with a snarl or a roar.First Leo must rise upon his hind legs and look in front of him. This posture was not hard for in his native jungle he had often thus obtained a breakfast of venison for his wife and family. But oh to stand a half hour on two legs only when he had four and would gladly have used all of them was hard. Yet this was the position called the lion rampant which kings liked best.But the kings uncles nephews nieces cousins and his wifes relations generally every one of them wanted a lion on his or her stationery and pocket handkerchiefs as well as on their shields and flags. So the old lion was torturedthe hot poker being always in sightand he was made to take a great variety of positions. The artist called out to Leo just as a driver says to his cart horse whoa get up golong etc. When he yelled in this fashion the lion had to obey.Pretty soon lions in heraldry on flags armor town arms family crests and city seals became all the fashion. The whole country went lionmad. There were lions carved in stone wood and iron and every sort and kind possible or impossible. Some of them seemed to be engaged in a variety of tricks as if they belonged to a circus or were having a holiday. They laughed giggled yawned stuck out their tongues held boards for hotels bundles for the shopkeepers or barrels for beer halls and made excellent shop signs which the boys and girls enjoyed looking at.Mrs. Leo was not in much demand for Mr. Leo did not approve of his wifes appearing in public. She was kept busy in taking care of her cubs. Daddy Lion had to do multiple work for his family until the cubs were grown. Yet long before this time had come their Dad had died and been stuffed for a museum. How this first king of beasts in the Netherlands came to his untimely end was on this wise.Not satisfied with posing Leo in every posture and with all possible gestures his master the artist wanted him to look heraldical that is like some of the mythical beasts that were combinations of any and all creatures having fins fur feathers or scales such as the dragon or griffin. One day he attempted to make out of a live lion a fanciful creature of curlicues and curliewurlies. So he strapped the lion down and used a curling iron on his mane until he looked like a bearded bull of Babylon. Then he combed out and with curl papers twisted the long line of hair which is seen in front of Leos stomach. In like manner he treated the bunches of hair that grow over the animals kneepans and elbows. Last of all he took a hair brush and smoothed out the tuft at the end of the animals long tail. Then the artist made a picture of him in this condition all curled and rich in ringlets like a dandy.By this time the father of the lion family looked as if he had come out fresh from a hairdressers parlor. Indeed Mrs. Leo was so struck with her husbands appearance that she immediately licked her cubs all over until their fur shone so they should look like their father. Then having used her tongue as a comb to make her own skin smooth and glossy she completed the job by using the nail in her tail to do the finishing work. Altogether this was the curliest family of lions ever seen and Daddy Leo appeared to be the funniest curlyheaded and curlybodied lion ever seen. In fact he was all curls from head to tail.Notwithstanding all his pains the artist was not yet satisfied with his job. He wanted a circle of long hair to grow in the middle of the lions tail. His curly lion should beat all creation and in this way he proceeded.His own daughter being a young lady and having some trouble of the throat the doctor had ordered medicine for the girl charging her not to spill any drops of the liquid on her face or clothes.But in giving the dose either the mother or the daughter was careless. At that very moment the cat ran across the room after the mouse and just as she held the spoon to her mouth Puss got twisted in her skirts. So most of the medicine splashed upon her upper lip and then ran down to her chin on either side of her mouth. She laughed over the spill wiped off the liquid and thought no more of the matter.But a week later she was astonished. On waking she looked in the glass only to shrink back in horror. On her face had grown both moustaches and a beard. True both were rather downy but still they were black and until the barber came and shaved off the growth she was a bearded woman. Yet strange to tell after one or two shaves by the barber no more hair grew again on her face which was smooth again.By Saint Servatus Ill make a fortune on this cried the artist when he saw his daughters hairy face.So he sold his secret to a druggist and this man made an ointment giving it a Chinese name meaning beardgrower. This wonderful medicine as his sign declared would force the growth of luxuriant moustaches and a beard on the smoothest face of any young man who should buy and apply it.Soon the whole town rang with the news of the wonderful discovery. The druggist sold out his stock in two days to happy purchasers. Other young fellows that wanted to outrival their companions had to wait a fortnight for the new medicine to be made. By that time a full crop of downy hair had come out on the cheeks and chin and upper lip of many a youth. Some who had been trying for years to raise moustaches in order duly to impress the girls to whom they were making love were now jubilant. In several cases a lover was able to cut out his rival and win the maid he wanted. Several courtings were hastened and became genuine matches because a face long very smooth and like a desert as to hair bore a promising crop. Beard and cheeks had at last met together. So the new medicine was called a matchmaker.The artist rubbed his hands in glee at the prospect of a fortune. He argued that if the wonderful ointment made beards for men it must be good for lions also. So again Daddy Lion was coerced by the threat of the hot poker. Then his tail was seized and by means of a rope tied to a post on one side of the cage he was held fast. Then the artist anointed about six inches of the middle of the smooth tail with the magic liquid. For fear the lion might lick it off the poor beast was held in this tiresome position for a whole week so that he could not turn round and he nearly died of fatigue.But it happened to the lions tail as it did with the young mens chins cheeks and upper lips. A beard did indeed grow but once shaved offand many did shave thinking to promote greater growthno more hair ever appeared again. The ointment forced a downy growth but it killed the roots of the hair.A worse fate befell the lion. A crop of hair perhaps an inch longer than common grew out. But this time the bad medicine which had deceived men and was unfit for lions struck in.From this cause added to nervous prostration old Leo fell dead. As lion fathers go he was a good one and his widow and children mourned for him. He had never once however hungry tried to eat up his cubs which was something in his favor.Soon after these exploits the old artist died also. His son hearing there was still a demand among kings for lions and those especially with centre curls in their tails took the most promising of the whelps and petted and fed him well. In the seventh year when his mane and elbow and knee hair had grown out this cub was mated to a young lioness of like promise. When of this couple a male whelp was born it was found that in due time its knees elbows tailtuft and the front of its body were all rich in furry growth. In the middle of its tail also thick ringlets several inches long were growing. Evidently the hair tonic had done some good. So this one became the father of all the curlytailed lions in the Netherlands. Not only was this lion thus distinguished for so novel an ornament copied into heraldry but it adorned many city seals and town arms. In time the lion of the Netherlands was pictured with a crown on its head a sword in its right hand a bundle of seven arrowsin token of a union of seven statesand still later the new Order of the Netherlands Lion was founded. The original curly lion with long hair in the middle of its tail boasts of a long line of descendants that are proud of their ancestor.

A Countrymans son by accident trod upon a Serpents tail which turned and bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his axe and pursuing the Serpent cut off part of its tail. So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmers cattle and caused him severe loss. Well the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair and said to it Lets forget and forgive perhaps you were right to punish my son and take vengeance on my cattle but surely I was right in trying to revenge him now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again No no said the Serpent take away your gifts you can never forget the death of your son nor I the loss of my tail. Injuries may be forgiven but not forgotten.
A certain man had two childrenone a boy and the other a girl. This man required his children to relate to him every morning what they had dreamed. Indeed the girl related her dream whatever she had dreamed every morning but the boy did not for he dreamed every night what eventually happened to him he dreamed that he killed a king took to wife a counts daughter and became king in the kingdom in which he killed the king. Exasperated at this his father thought the reason why he did not tell his dream was because he was afraid and drove him out along a road and beat him so that he cried piteously. A count was driving past and heard the child crying. He ordered his servant to go to the man and tell him not to beat the child but say how much he should give him to take it away himself. The man said in reply that he need only take it away from before his eyes. He immediately took it and delivered it to the count and the count took it away home. The count had one daughter who took a great affection for the boy. It was also a custom with the count that the children were obliged to relate what they dreamed. But he would not reveal his dream to the count and say what he had dreamed and he had dreamed the very same dream that he had dreamed at his fathers. Then the count became very angry and caused a vault to be built in his garden inside which he was to be thrown and it was to be constructed of such masonry that nobody should be able to give him anything to eat and that no light should by possibility enter it. But the counts daughter who was very sorry for the boy went out to the masons and promised them a purse of money only to construct it in such a manner that she would be able to give him food at night. This the masons did in return for the good money. He was seven years inside and unable to sit or lie.Now came a time when king sent a staff to the count and said he would attack him with an army if he did not tell him on which side the staff opened. Now the damsel came at night and brought the lad food saying Now I have brought you food for the last time because a king has sent us a staff and my father must open it if he does not open it he will attack us with an army. We must perish under the open sky but you in this vault. He replied that she was not to frighten herself but go lie down and soon jump up and say to your father My dear papa I have dreamt of good luck for us. He will say What Reply to him I dreamt that I should tell you that if you will open the staff you need only fill a tub with water and put the staff in it the staff will turn with that side up on which it opens. Even so it came to pass. Her father did so sealed up the staff on that side and sent it to the king. The king wrote back to him You have certainly done it but not with your own stupid head. But you have one hard by your house of whom you know not he has done this for you. Then he wrote a letter again to the count and said I shall send you three horses all alike and you must tell me how many years old each is.And all alike they were. One was one year old the second two and the third three years old. Then the damsel took him food and said to him Now I am bringing you food for the last time you will have to die here and we in the open air for the king has sent us three horses exactly alike and we must tell him how old each is. He replied that she must go and lie down and say that she had dreamt thus that he must prepare three heaps of oats of three different years and let the horses go to the oats and they would go of themselves each to his own heap the one which was one year old would go to the oneyearold oats the second to the second and the third to the third heap. She told him this. And it came to pass just as she told him. Then he wrote in reply to the king and the king to him Certainly you have done this but not with your own stupid head but you have another who does it for you of whom you are not aware. But I shall send you one thing more. I shall send you on a given day at the hour when you will be at dinner a warmace weighing three hundredweight it will strike the spoon out of your mouth. You must throw it back to me just as I threw it to you. Indeed this too came to pass.The mace flew in knocked his spoon out of his hands and flew off with speed into the cellar inside which it stuck so fast that a score of soldiers couldnt move much less throw it. Now the count assembled and invited all people but no one was able to do it. She took him food again and said to him You have set us free twice but certainly the third time you will not be able to do so and now you will die here and all of us in the open air. He then asked her what sort of work it was that had to be done. She told him and he answered Go home and lie down then get up and say that you have dreamt that no one else but I can do it so I tell you but the count will not believe you yet will think since you have twice dreamed with success that possibly now too it may be true.And so it came to pass. The count caused him to be dug out. He saw how weak he was and said I am stronger than he but I cant throw it how then can he throw it He then said Go to a certain king he has nine hundred cows and has them all registered when each was calved. Buy for me one cow which is neither more nor less than nine years old and whatever he says you are to pay for it pay. If you pay one kreutzer less I shall be two hundredweight lighter. Well he went thither and inquired whether he had such a cow. The king answered that he had. Then he asked the price. The king replied Nine thousand pieces of silver. He paid them drove it home and had it slaughtered immediately. The young man then said that he must be three months by himself in a house without anybody being allowed to go in to him. Now he took at once two pounds of beef but did not eat the flesh but only the soup. This lasted for three months. Well the cook told the count that he would not eat the flesh in order to serve his own interests. Then the count went himself to him and asked him why he would not eat the flesh. He replied that something must be brought him to eat. Now he took a piece threw it upon the wall and said to the count You see the flesh has fallen down and the soup has stuck to the wall and so it is with me the soup abides with me and the flesh goes down from me.Then he went out to look at the mace. He was already able to move it. Then he went in for three months to eat. Then he was able with his left hand to throw it two hundred fathoms high into the air. He went in once more to eat for three months. Now he was exceedingly strong and told the count to write freely to the king that on such and such a day at such and such an hour the mace would arrive and knock the spoon out of his mouth at dinner. In fact so it was. He threw it a hundred and twentyfive hours walk into the other kingdom. Now the king saw that he had done this also. Then he wrote to him Certainly you have done all that I told you but not with your own stupid head but he has done it for you whom you caused to be walled up in a vault. But you must send him here to me that I may see him. But he wanted to slay him. Now the count was unwilling to let him go butnevertheless he was obliged to do so. But do you know what count Cause all your people to be summoned hither and we will select as many as ever we can that resemble me.There were only nine such and he was himself the tenth. Now he told him to have exactly similar uniforms made for them all so that at any rate no one would know one to be different from another and to provide similar horses for all and then he would go thither. Even so it came to pass. Then the ten went. But before they arrived at the town he said to them Indeed you dont know why we are going thither we are going to be put to death but I tell you not to be in any wise afraid. This king will give you the word of command when we enter Milutin such was the boys name dismount Then you must all dismount so that no one is behindhand but all alike and at once. Then he will say Milutin go into the houseall go into the house. Milutin shut the doorall off to shut it. Milutin take your seat at tableall do it at once. Milutin go to bedall off to bed at once.Even so it was. Thus the king could in no wise recognise him and did not venture to slaughter them but ordered his servant to conceal himself under a bed and listen which spoke most wisely and put a mark upon him. Now they all lay down and began to converse as to what would come out of this. Milutin then said Doubtless till now he has not recognised me and will ride after me and will overtake us but never mind that only kneel down and pray to God. Then notice well if I first emit fire out of my mouth kill yourselves but if he emits it first have no fear whatever this signifies to you that human flesh will seethe in human blood. The man under the bed heard this speech and cut off a piece from the heel of his boot. Morning arrived and Milutin told them that each must look well at his clothes maybe there would be some mark on someones uniform. But all at once he observed that just his bootheel had been cut off and said All give me your boots that I may cut off each of the heels just as I have mine cut off. Now the king came to summon them Milutin come to breakfast and they all went at once.And the king saw that they all had a similar mark and therefore did not know which to put to death. Then he reprimanded the servant. Now said the king Milutin go home and they all went homeward at once. But erelong the king recognised Milutin by his horsefor he had the horse from the countand overtook him. They immediately knelt down as he had previously bidden them and he began first to fight on horseback but nothing came of it. Then they both dismounted from their horses and fought thus each leaping against the other so that the earth quaked under them. Thus they fought terribly for some time. But all at once they observed that the king emitted fire out of his mouth and then Milutin afterwards. Then the king spat pure fire out of his mouth at Milutin and Milutin also spat fire. The two fought on in this frightful manner but suddenly Milutin overcame the king threw him down cut off his head and carried it home to the count. Now all was merriment and Milutin married the counts daughter took possession of the realm of the king whom he had slain and there was a grand festival. Thats the end.
At Behary lived a peasant whose name was Palichka. One day as he was walking to market at Kopidlno he found in the field under a peartree a black hen wet trembling with cold and crying. Palichka took the hen under his cloak and having brought her home put her behind the oven so that she might dry herself and then let her go into the yard among his other fowls.At night when everybody was asleep the peasant heard a strange noise in his storeroom and now and then a piercing voice half human and half like that of a fowl crying Master I have brought you some potatoes Palichka jumped out of bed rushed into the storeroom and there saw a flaming hen and three heaps of potatoes the hen was flying from heap to heap. Fie you unclean thing cried the terrified peasant and having violently shut the door he went to bed again but he could not sleep from fear at the thought of what a terrible creature he had brought home. In the morning he removed all these potatoes to a dunghill.On the following night Palichka again heard the same voice crying Master I have brought you some wheat rye and barley Palichka did not go to see what it was but trembling with fear like a leaf he prayed continually Deliver us from evil. In the morning he took up a spade and a besom and having carefully swept the room he removed all this corn away so that not even a grain was left behind.This event gave him a great deal of anxiety he did not know what to do and was greatly alarmed lest any of his neighbours should hear about it. But his neighbours soon knew all about the matter they saw at night something flying to Palichkas house looking like a burning wisp of straw and yet it did not set the house on fire in the daytime they observed a black hen in the yard among the other fowls. Soon a report was spread in the village that gossip Palichka had sold himself to the demon. Some of the more sober of his neighbours shook their heads doubtfully as from his youth they knew Palichka to be both pious and honest and they agreed among themselves to go and speak to him about the rumour. Accordingly they called upon Palichka and he told them candidly everything that had happened and asked them to advise him what to do.Afterwards some of the neighbours advised Palichka to sell all he had and remove from thence as Rarash would doubtless remain in the house. The peasant readily seized this idea and searched for a buyer but no one would buy a house with a Rarash in it. Palichka however was determined to get rid of Rarash at any price. Accordingly he sold all his corn cattle and all that he did not absolutely want bought a new hut in a neighbouring village and removed there. Having arrived for the last time with a cart and loaded it with sheep troughs household utensils harrows and other implements he set his strawcovered hut on fire it stood alone and could not hurt any other building. Then he cracked his whip and was about to drive away before doing so however he looked once more at his hut as it was burning and saidMay you burn there you unclean thing I am sure to get something for the land at least.Ha ha ha laughed somebody behind him on the cart. Palichka looked round and on the handle of a scythe the black hen was sitting she flapped with her wings and began to singWe shall remove from here we shall not stop hereWe shall not stop here we shall go away from hereWe shall not stop here we shall remove from hereWe shall remove from here somewhere else we shall steal.Gossip Palichka felt like one thunderstruck. He really did not know what to do next. Then a thought occurred to him whether Rarash would not be persuaded to go away of his own accord if he would feed him well. Accordingly he asked his wife to give Rarash daily a dishful of fresh milk and three small loaves of wheaten bread. Rarash enjoyed this food immensely and it did not seem at all likely that he would go away. One evening as Palichkas servant boy returned home from the field he saw on the steps of the hut the three small loaves which the wife had put there for Rarash. Being hungry the boy took up one of the loaves and ate it.It is better that I should eat this bread than that goblin he said to himself.At that very moment Rarash jumped upon his back and screamed First loaf second loaf Vashek ate the third loaf And after every exclamation pecked him so dreadfully on the back that for a long time afterwards the boy had black and blue marks on his body. In the morning when Palichka got up and went to wake the boy he found him so dreadfully beaten that he could scarcely move. Having heard what had happened Palichka went at once to Rarash and begged him to go away as otherwise no man would be willing to serve in his house.Ha ha ha laughed Rarash and said Take me there where you brought me from and I shall not trouble you any longer.The peasant at once put on his cloak and carried the hen back to the same peartree where he had found her. From that moment Rarash never troubled him any more.In a sheepfold at Libenice there was another Rarash but there he was called Shetek. He looked like a little boy only instead of nails he had claws on his fingers and toes. The farm labourers told many merry stories about him. Shetek was very fond of teasing dogs cats and turkeys he also did a great deal of mischief to the farm servants and whenever they did anything which they did not like their master to know he was sure to expose them afterwards. On that account especially the farm servants hated him very much they were however afraid to do anything to him because he would be sure to revenge himself moreover the master would not allow him to be hurt as during the whole of the time that Shetek stopped in the sheepfold not one of the sheep sickened.In winter Shetek loved to sit on the top of the oven and warm himself and when the young women brought into the room husks in pails in order to pour hot water over them he used to jump down from the oven into the pail screaming Now for the husks But one day he burned himself dreadfully. One of the young women had filled her pail with boiling hot water sprinkled some husks on the top of it and then came into the room as usual. Now for the husks cried Shetek and jumped into the pail but in a moment he was out again screaming and writhing with pain. The servants laughed so loudly that the windows shook in their frames. Shetek never forgave the girl. One day as she was walking over a ladder lying on the ground he entangled her dress so much in it that the other servants were obliged to come to the girls assistance and it was a long time before they could disengage her from the ladder.In summertime the farm servants used to sleep in the open air. One night Shetek came to them and having half climbed up a ladder that was standing near he began to tease the dogs that were sleeping in the yard. He lifted up now one of his legs now another and continually called out to themOne legtwo legs which of them would you like to biteThe dogs barked at him and almost got mad with fury. The men too became very angry with him for disturbing them in their sleep so one of them got up took up a bundle of straw threw it at Shetek and knocked him down with it from the ladder. The dogs received Shetek rather warmly and it was with the greatest difficulty that he escaped from them. The man knew that Shetek was sure to revenge himself he therefore was on his guard and tried to avoid him. All this precaution however did not help him in the least. One day as he was watching a flock of sheep in the meadow he sat down on the grass behind a heap of hay. Suddenly he heard a rustling noise near and before he had time to see what it was the whole heap of hay was thrown over him and entangled in his hair. The man screamed for help and the mowers ran to his assistance but do what they would they could not disentangle the hay from among the hair they were so closely interwoven one with the other. The man was obliged to have his head shaved. When some time afterwards he drove the sheep into the meadow and came to a wild peartree Shetek who was sitting on the top of it mocked him and laughed Ha ha ha
Once upon a time there lived in a little village in the very middle of France a widow and her only son a boy about fifteen whose name was Antoine though no one ever called him anything but TouenoBoueno. They were very poor indeed and their hut shook about their ears on windy nights till they expected the walls to fall in and crush them but instead of going to work as a boy of his age ought to do TouenoBoueno did nothing but lounge along the street his eyes fixed on the ground seeing nothing that went on round him.You are very very stupid my dear child his mother would sometimes say to him and then she would add with a laugh Certainly you will never catch a wolf by the tail.One day the old woman bade Antoine go into the forest and collect enough dry leaves to make beds for herself and him. Before he had finished it began to rain heavily so he hid himself in the hollow trunk of a tree where he was so dry and comfortable that he soon fell fast asleep. By and by he was awakened by a noise which sounded like a dog scratching at the door and he suddenly felt frightened why he did not know. Very cautiously he raised his head and right above him he saw a big hairy animal coming down tail foremost.It is the wolf that they talk so much about he said to himself and he made himself as small as he could and shrunk into a corner.The wolf came down the inside of the tree slowly slowly Antoine felt turned to stone so terrified was he and hardly dared to breathe. Suddenly an idea entered his mind which he thought might save him still. He remembered to have heard from his mother that a wolf could neither bend his back nor turn his head so as to look behind him and quick as lightning he stretched up his hand and seizing the wolfs tail pulled it towards him.Then he left the tree and dragged the animal to his mothers house.Mother you have often declared that I was too stupid to catch a wolf by the tail. Now see he cried triumphantly.Well well wonders will never cease answered the good woman who took care to keep at a safe distance. But as you really have got him let us see if we cant put him to some use. Fetch the skin of the ram which died last week out of the chest and we will sew the wolf up in it. He will make a splendid ram and to morrow we will drive him to the fair and sell him.Very likely the wolf who was cunning and clever may have understood what she said but he thought it best to give no sign and suffered the skin to be sewn upon him.I can always get away if I choose thought he it is better not to be in a hurry so he remained quite still while the skin was drawn over his head which made him very hot and uncomfortable and resisted the temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth.The fair was at its height next day when TouenoBoueno arrived with his wolf in rams clothing. All the farmers crowded round him each offering a higher price than the last. Never had they beheld such a beautiful beast said they and at last after much bargaining he was handed over to three brothers for a good sum of money.It happened that these three brothers owned large flocks of sheep though none so large and fine as the one they had just bought.My flock is the nearest observed the eldest brother we will leave him in the fold for the night and tomorrow we will decide which pastures will be best for him. And the wolf grinned as he listened and held up his head a little higher than before.Early next morning the young farmer began to go his rounds and the sheepfold was the first place he visited. To his horror the sheep were all stretched out dead before him except one which the wolf had eaten bones and all. Instantly the truth flashed upon him. It was no ram that lay curled up in the corner pretending to be asleep for in reality he could bend back and turn his head as much as he liked but a wolf who was watching him out of the corner of his eye and might spring upon him at any moment. So the farmer took no notice and only thought that here was a fine chance of revenging himself on his next brother for a trick which he had played and merely told him that the ram would not eat the grass in that field and it might be well to drive him to the pasture by the river where his own flock was feeding. The second brother eagerly swallowed the bait and that evening the wolf was driven down to the field where the young man kept the sheep which had been left him by his father. By the next morning they also were all dead but the second brother likewise held his peace and allowed the sheep which belonged to the youngest to share the fate of the other two. Then they met and confessed to each other their disasters and resolved to take the animal as fast as possible back to TouenoBoueno who should get a sound thrashing.Antoine was sitting on a plum tree belonging to a neighbour eating the ripe fruit when he saw the three young farmers coming towards him. Swinging himself down he flew home to the hut crying breathlessly Mother mother the farmers are close by with the wolf. They have found out all about it and will certainly kill me and perhaps you too. But if you do as I tell you I may be able to save us both. Lie down on the floor and pretend to be dead and be sure not to speak whatever happens.Thus when the three brothers each armed with a whip entered the hut a few seconds later they found a woman extended on the floor and Toueno kneeling at her side whistling loudly into her ears.What are you doing now you rascal asked the eldest.What am I doing Oh my poor friends I am the most miserable creature in the world I have lost the best of mothers and I dont know what will become of me and he hid his face in his hands and sobbed again.But what are you whistling like that forWell it is the only chance. This whistle has been known to bring the dead back to life and I hoped here he buried his face in his hands again but peeping between his fingers he saw that the brother had opened their six eyes as wide as saucers.Look he suddenly exclaimed with a cry Look I am sure I felt her body move And now her nostrils are twitching. Ah the whistle has not lost its power after all and stooping down Toueno whistled more loudly than before so that the old womans feet and hands showed signs of life and she soon was able to life her head.The farmers were so astonished at her restoration that it was some time before they could speak. At length the eldest turned to the boy and saidNow listen to me. There is no manner of doubt that you are a young villain. You sold us a ram knowing full well that it was a wolf and we came here today to pay you out for it. But if you will give us that whistle we will pardon what you have done and will leave you alone.It is my only treasure and I set great store by it answered the boy pretending to hesitate. But as you wish for it so much well I suppose I cant refuse and he held out the whistle which the eldest brother put in his pocket.Armed with the precious whistle the three brothers returned home full of joy and as they went the youngest said to the others I have such a good idea Our wives are all lazy and grumbling and make our lives a burden. Let us give them a lesson and kill them as soon as we get in. Of course we can restore them to life at once but they will have had a rare fright.Ah how clever you are answered the other two. Nobody else would have thought of that.So gaily the three husbands knocked down their three wives who fell dead to the ground. Then one by one the men tried the whistle and blew so loudly that it seemed as if their lungs would burst but the women lay stark and stiff and never moved an eyelid. The husbands grew pale and cold for they had never dreamed of this nor meant any harm and after a while they understood that their efforts were of no use and that once more the boy had tricked them. With stern faces they rose to their feet and taking a large sack they retraced their steps to the hut.This time there was no escape. Toueno had been asleep and only opened his eyes as they entered. Without a word on either side they thrust him into the sack and tying up the mouth the eldest threw it over his shoulder. After that they all set out to the river where they intended to drown the boy.But the river was a long way off and the day was very hot and Antoine was heavy heavier than a whole sheaf of corn. They carried him in turns but even so they grew very tired and thirsty and when a little tavern came in sight on the roadside they thankfully flung the sack down on a bench and entered to refresh themselves. They never noticed that a beggar was sitting in the shade at the end of the bench but Touenos sharp ears caught the sound of someone eating and as soon as the farmers had gone into the inn he began to groan softly.What is the matter asked the beggar drawing a little nearer. Why have they shut you up poor boyBecause they wanted to make me a bishop and I would not consent answered Toueno.Dear me exclaimed the beggar yet it isnt such a bad thing to be a bishop.I dont say it is replied the young rascal but I should never like it. However if you have any fancy for wearing a mitre you need only untie the sack and take my place.I should like nothing better said the man as he stooped to undo the big knot.So it was the beggar and not TouenoBoueno who was flung into the water.The next morning the three wives were buried and on returning from the cemetery their husbands met TouenoBoueno driving a magnificent flock of sheep. At the sight of him the three farmers stood still with astonishment.What you scoundrel they cried at last we drowned you yesterday and today we find you again as well as everIt does seem odd doesnt it answered he. But perhaps you dont know that beneath this world there lies another yet more beautiful and far far richer. Well it was there that you sent me when you flung me into the river and though I felt a little strange at first yet I soon began to look about me and to see what was happening. There I noticed that close to the place where I had fallen a sheep fair was being held and a bystander told me that every day horses or cattle were sold somewhere in the town. If I had only had the luck to be thrown into the river on the side of the horse fair I might have made my fortune As it was I had to content myself with buying these sheep which you can get for nothing.And do you know exactly the spot in the river which lies over the horse fairAs if I did not know it when I have seen it with my own eyes.Then if you do not want us to avenge our dead flocks and our murdered wives you will have to throw us into the river just over the place of the horse fair.Very well only you must get three sacks and come with me to that rock which juts into the river. I will throw you in from there and you will fall nearly on to the horses backs.So he threw them in and as they were never seen again no one ever knew into which fair they had fallen.
Many years ago in a certain city in Germany there lived an honest cobbler and his wife. The good man sat all day and mended boots and shoes he made new ones too if he could get a customer to trust him with the job but then he had first to buy the leather for he was too poor to keep a stock in hand. His wife sold fruit and vegetables which she grew in a little plot of ground outside the city gates. She had many customers for she was clean and tidy and had a knack of setting out her wares to be best advantage. The cobbler and his wife had a beautiful litde boy named Jacob. Although he was eight  years of ge he was tall and wellgrown and so he sat by his mothers side in the marketplace and acted as errand boy to the house wives and cooks who made large purchases from his mother carrying the fruit and vegetables home for them.Very often he came back with a piece of money in his pocket or at least with a cake or some sweetmeats for he was so pretty and obliging that people liked to see him in their homes. One morning the cobblers wife was sitting in her accustomed place in the market. She had a supply of cabbages and other vegetables fresh herbs and seeds and a smaller basket of earlv pears and apricots. Little Jacob sat beside her and called out in his shrill little voice Come buy come buy fine cabbages fresh herbs early pears fine ripe apples and apricots. Come buy buy buy my mothers goods are cheap today.An old woman came slowly across the market place. She was dressed in rags and tatters and had a little pointed face all wrinkled and furrowed with age redrimmed eyes and a sharp hooked nose that nearly met the pointed chin. She helped herself along with a stick and it is difficult to say how she moved for she stumbled and limped and rolled along almost as thoutjh her leofs were brokendown wheels which would soon give way. The cobblers wife stared hard at her for although she had been sitting in the marketplace every day for the last sixteen years she had never noticed the queer old creature before. But she shuddered involuntarily when the old woman hobbled to wards her and stood still before the baskets.Are you Hannah the vegetable dealer she said in a cracked unpleasant voice her head shaking as though with palsy. Yes that is my name replied the cobblers wife is there anything I can serve you withTo must see I must see she replied. Let me look at our herbs and see if you have anything I require. She plunged her brown skinny fingers into the basket of herbs which had been so neatly set out and grasping handful after handful put them to her long hooked nose and smelt them. The cobblers wife was much put out to see her rare herbs handled in this way but she did not like to say anything for it was the customers right to examine the goods and besides she was half afraid of the old woman. When the whole of the basket of herbs had been handled and turned over the old woman muttered  Rubbish rubbish the whole lot of it. Fifty years ago I could have bought what I wanted this is good for nothing.These words angered little Jacob. You are a rude old woman he said angrily first you take up our beautiful fresh herbs in your nasty between fingers and crush them then you put them to Our long hooked nose so that nobody else who had seen you would want to buy them and then you miscall our wares as bad stuff and rubbish when even the Dukes cook does not disdain to buy from us.The old woman looked fixedly at the spirited lad and laughed in a repulsive manner. Then said she in a hoarse croaking voice Ah my little man do you like my nose my nice long nose Then you shall have a nice long nose too one that shall reach from the middle of your face right down below your chin.As she talked she shuffled along to the other basket in which the cabbages were placed. She took the finest creamy crisp heads and crushed them in her hands until they creaked and cracked then threw them back into the basket anyhow. Bad goods bad cabbages she said.Dont shake your head to and fro like that cried the little boy beginning to feel frightened. Your neck is as thin as a cabbage stalk and looks as though it might snap in two and if your head rolled off into our cabbage basket who would buy from us thenSo you dont like thin necks eh muttered the old woman. Very well then you shall have none at all. Your head shall stick close down to our shoulders so that there will be no danger of its falling off your little body.Come come dont talk such rubbish to the child said the cobblers wife vexed at length if you wish to buy anything make your choice for you are frightening other customers away.Very well answered the old woman grimly I will buy these six cabbages. But you must let your little son carry them home for me for I have to support myself on my stick and can carry nothing myself. I will reward him for his trouble.The little boy did not want to go and began to cry for he was afraid of the ugly old woman but his mother bade him go quite sternly she wouldve been ashamed to let the weakly old creature carry such a heavy burden so he put the cabbages in a cloth and followed the old woman from the marketplace. She walked so slowly that it was about three quarters of an hour before they reached her home which was in a very outoftheway part of the town and which was a miserablelooking little house.The old woman drew a rusty key from her pocket and slipped it into the keyhole and the door sprang open. But what was little Jacobs astonishment on entering the house to find it most beautiful. The walls and ceiling were of marble the furniture of ebonv inlaid with gold and polished jewels and the floor was of glass and so slippery that the little boy fell down several times. The old woman drew a little silver whistle from her pocket and blew it so shrilly that the tones resounded all through the house. A number of guineapigs at once came hurrying down the stairs and Jacob was astounded to see that they were walking erect on their hind legs and had their feet thrust into nutshells instead of shoes. They wore mens clothing and had hats on their heads made in the newest fashion.Where have you put my slippers you ragamuffins asked the old woman striking them with her staff so that they began to whine and jump about. How much longer do you expect to keep me standing hereThe guineapigs bounded up the stairs and soon returned with a pair of cocoanut shells lined and bound with leather. These they put on the old womans feet and at once she ceased to hobble and limp flung away her staff and began to glide about over the slippery floor with the greatest rapidity dragging Jacob after her. She came at length to a room bearing some resemblance to a kitchen though the tables were of mahogany and the couches and chairs covered with exquisite tapestries.Sit down said the old woman in friendly tones pushing him as she spoke into a corner of a sofa and then rolling a table in front of him so that he could not get out again. You must be tired walking so far and carrying such a heavy burden she said now I am going to reward you for your trouble and make you some soup such as you have never tasted before and will remember all your life long.She again blew her whistle and again a number of guineapigs appeared dressed in human attire. They wore cooks aprons and had cooking spoons and carving knives stuck in their waistbands. After them came a crowd of squirrels clad in wide Turkish trousers with little green velvet caps on their heads. They appeared to be the kitchen servants for they at once began to clamber up and down the walls and brought pots and pans eggs and butter herbs and flour and carried them to the firepkice where the old woman seemed to be very busy with her cookery. The fire burned merrily and the contents of the pans began to steam and hiss and send forth a very pleasant smell.At length the soup was cooked and the old woman poured some into a silver dish and set it before little Jacob Eat mv little man said sheand you will have all that you have coveted in me. You shall become a clever cook too but you shall never never find the herb that was missing in your mothers basket.The boy did not understand what she was talking about but he went on eating his soup which was delicious. His mother often cooked tasty dishes for him but never anything like this. An odour of fine herbs and vegetables arose from it it was both sour and sweet and very strong. As he finished the last of it the guineapigs set light to some incense which rose in a blue cloud and was wafted througli the room. Thicker and thicker the incense rose athe little boy began to feel stupefied. He tried to rise telling himself that he must hasten back to his mother but he only fell back again and at length quite overcome he fell fast asleep on the old womans sofa. Then he began to dream such strange dreamsIt seemed to him as though the old woman took off all his clothes and dressed him up in a squirrels skin and he was at once able to jump about like the other squirrels in the house and began to take his place with them and the guineapigs and that like they he too became one of the old womans servants. At first he was the shoeblack and it was his duty to polish the cocoanut shells the old woman wore instead of shoes. He had learnt to polish shoes in his own home and as his father was a cobbler he had been particularly well taught so that he was clever at his work.A year seemed to pass and then he dreamt that he was given more important duties. He and some other squirrels were set to work to catch the sunbeam dust and sift it through fine sieves. This dust was used instead of flour to make the bread the old woman ate for she had no teeth and sunbeam dust makes the very softest and finest of bread.Another dream year passed and then he was promoted to be one of the watercarriers. You must not imagine the old woman kept a watercistern or a waterbutt handy. Oh dear no Jacob and the squirrels had to draw the dew from the roses into hazelnut shells this was the old womans drinking water and as she was always thirsty it was hard work to keep her supplied with it. At the end of another year he was appointed to do the indoor work. His particular duty was to keep the glass floor in order. He had to sweep it over and then wrap soft polishing cloths round his feet and slide up and down the room until the glass shone brilliantly.At the end of the year he was promoted to the kitchen this was a place of honour only to be reached after long training. lie began at the beginning as a scullion and advanced rapidly until he was head cook. Sometimes he could not but wonder at his own skill for he could cook the most difficult dishes and could make no less than two hundred different kinds of pastries. Then he was a firstrate hand at soups and could make every kind that had ever been heard of and knew the use of every kind of vegetable that grew. Several years had now passed away in the service of the old woman and one day she put on her cocoanut shoes took her staff and basket in her hand and prepared to go out.Before leaving she told Jacob to cook a chicken for her dinner on her return and be sure to stuff it well with seasoning. When he had prepared the chicken he went to the room where the herbs were kept to collect some to stuff it with and to his surprise saw a little cupboard that he had not noticed before. The door was ajar and he peeped curiously in and saw a number of little baskets from which issued a strong and pleasant odour. He opened one of them and saw that it contained a very curiouslooking plant. The leaves and stalks were of a bluishgreen colour and it bore a flower of a deep red hue flecked with yellow.He looked closely at the flower then smelt it and noticed it had the same scent as the soup which the old woman had once cooked for him. It was a very strong scent so strong indeed that it made him sneeze and he went on sneezing again and again until at length  he awoke. He lay on the old womans sofa and looked around him in surprise.How real dreams do seem sometimes he said to himself. I could have been certain that I was a squirrel just now and had guineapigs and squirrels for my companions also that I had learnt to be a firstrate cook. How Mother will laugh when I tell her all about it but she will scold me too for having fallen asleep in a strangers house instead of helping her in the marketplace.He jumped up in a hurry but his limbs were stiff from sleeping so long especially his neck he could not turn it about very easily and he seemed so sleepy still that he kept striking his nose against the walls and cupboards. As he stood upon the threshold the guineapigs and squirrels came whimpering round him as though they would like to go with him and he begged them to come for they were dear little creatures but they went clattering back in their nutshell shoes and he could hear them squeaking away in the house.The old woman had brought him a long distance from the marketplace and he had some difficulty in finding his way back through the narrow lanes especially as there seemed to be a great crowd of people. Somewhere near he thought there must be a dwarf to be seen for the people were pushing and craning their necks and calling out to one another Just look what a hideous dwarf Where can he come from What a long nose he has and how his head is sunk between his high shoulders he has no neck at all and see what great brown hands he has.Jacob would have liked to have seen the dwarf himself for he always liked to see anything extra ordinary but he could not wait because he knew he ought to hurry ack to his mother. He felt frightened and nervous when at length he reached the marketplace for his mother looked so altered. He felt sure he could not have slept very long for she had still a quantity of fruit and vegetables unsold but she sat with her head leaning on her hand never calling out to the passersby to buy her wares. She was paler too and looked very sad. He hesitated as to what he should do but at length he took heart and crept up behind her and laying his hand caressingly upon her arm said Mother dear what ails you Are you angry with meShe turned to look at him but started back with a cry of horror. What do you want with me you hideous dwarf she cried. Such jokes are out of place.But Mother said Jacob in alarm you cannot be well. Why do you drive your son away Have I not told you to go away said Hannah angrily you will get nothing from me by such jokes you ugly creature.She must be out of her mind said the little one however shall I get her back home Mother dear look well at me I am your own little son Jacob.Now you have gone too far with your impertinence cried the woman.  Not content you hideous dwarf with standing there and frightening my customers away you must needs make game of my grief and sorrow. Neighbours listen to this fellow who dares to say he is my son Jacob.Her neighbours all came crowding round her and began to abuse poor Jacob in no measured terms telling him it was cruel to joke with a  bereaved mother who had had her lovely boy stolen awav seven long years ago  and they threatened to tear him limb from limit if he did not go away at once. Poor Jacob knew not what to make of it all. He had gone that morning with his mother to the marketplace or so he beheved had helped her set out her wares of fruit and vegetables had carried home the old womans cabbages taken a little soup and fallen asleep for a short time and yet his mother and the neighbours declared he had been absent seven years. And they called him a horrible dwarf What could have taken placeWhen he saw that his mother would have nothing to do with him the tears came into his eyes and he turned sadly away and went up the street towards the little shop where his father sat and mended shoes during the daytime. I will see if he will recognise me he said to himself. I will just stand in the doorway and speak to him.When he reached the cobblers shop he stood in the doorway and looked in. The old man was so busy that he did not notice him at first but presently on looking up he dropped the shoe he was mending and cried out Good gracious me what is that Good evening master said the little man as he entered the shop how is trade just nowBad very bad little gentleman said the cobbler I cannot work as well as I did I am getting old and have no one to help me for I cannot afford an assistant. Jacob was astounded that his father should not have recognised him either so he answered Have you no son whom you could train to help youI had one Jacob by name he should be a tall wellgrown youth by now who would have been able to be my right hand for even as a little fellow he was handy and clever at my trade. He was so handsome too and had such pleasant manners that he would no doubt have brought me more customers very likely by this time I might have given up cobbling shoes and have made new ones instead. But alas such is lifeWhere is your son then enquired Jacob with trembling voice.No one can tell replied the old man for seven years ago he was stolen from us.Seven years ago cried Jacob in horrorstricken tones.Yes little gentleman seven long years ago. I remember it as though it were yesterday. My wife came home from the market weeping and wringing her hands the child had been absent all day and though she had searched for him everywhere she had not been able to find him. I had warned her many a time to keep a careful eye upon our pretty boy telling her there were bad folks in the town who might steal him for the sake of his good looks. But she was proud of him and often when the gentry bought fruit and vegetables of her she sent him to carry home their purchases. But one day an ugly old woman came into the market and began to bargain with her. In the end she bought more than she could carry and my wife being a kindhearted woman let her take the boy with her and from that hour to this he has never been seen again.And that was seven years ago asked Jacob. Seven years alas We sought him high and low and our neighbours who had all known and loved the dear little fellow helped in the search but without avail. Neither could we hear any news of the old woman who had taken him away. No one seemed to know anything about her except one old woman who was over ninety years of age and she said she must be the wicked Fairy Herbina who visited the town once every fifty vears to buy things she required. Thus spoke Jacobs father as he hammered away at his shoe and drew the thread backwards and forwards busily and the poor little fellow began to understand at last what had happened to him. It had been no dream but transformed into a squirrel he had really served the wicked fairy for seven years. His heart was wellnigh ready to burst with rage and grief. Seven years of his youth had been stolen from him and what had he received in return He had learnt to polish cocoanut shoes and glass floors. Also he had learnt all the secrets of the art of cookery from the old womans guineapigsHe stood so long considering what had been said that his father asked him at length Can I do anything for you sir Do you require a pair of shoes or he added with a smile perhaps a covering for your nose would be useful to you.What is the matter with my nose asked Jacob why should I require a covering for itAell replied the cobbler everone to his taste. But I must say if I had a nose like yours I would make a case for it of bright red leather. See I have just such a piece by me. A good stout cover for your nose would be most useful for I am quite sure you must be constantly knocking it against everything that comes in your way.The little fellows heart sank with fear. He felt his nose and found it was very thick and quite two spans in length. And so the old woman had altered his appearance too That was why his mother had not known him and why everyone called him an ugly dwarf. Master he said to his father  have you a mirror you could lend meYoung sir said the father earnestly your figure is hardly such as to give you cause for conceit and you have no reason to look into a glass constantly. Break yourself of the habit in your case it is a foolish one.Believe me it is not out of conceit that I wish to see myself said Jacob and I do beseech you to lend me a glass for a moment.I do not possess such a thing said the cobbler. My wife had one somewhere but I do not know where she has hidden it. If you really do wish to see yourself you had best go across the road and ask Urban the barber to let you take a look in his. He has one about twice the size of your head so go and admire yourself by all means.With these words his father took him by the shoulders and pushed him gently from the shop locked the door upon him and went on with his work. Jacob who had known the barber well in days gone by crossed the road and entered his shop. Goodmorning Urban he said I have come to ask a favour of you. Will you be so good as to allow me a glance into your lookingglassWith pleasure there it stands he said laughing heartily and the customer who was being shaved laughed also. You are a handsome little fellow the barber went on tall and slim a neck like a swan hands as dainty as a queens and as pretty a little nose as one could see anywhere. It is no wonder that you are conceited and wish to take a glance at yourself. Well you are welcome to the use of my mirrors for it shall never be said of me that I was so jealous of your good looks I would not lend you my mirror to admire them in.Shrieks of laughter greeted the barbers words but poor little Jacob who had seen himself reflected in the mirror could not keep the tears from his eyes. No wonder you did not recognise your son. Mother dear he said to himself in the happy days when you were wont to parade him proudly before the neighbours eyes he bore little resemblance to the thing he has now become.Poor fellow his eyes were small and set like a pigs his nose was enormous und reached beyond his chin his neck had disappeared altogether and his head had sunk down between his shoulders so that it was painful to attempt to move it either to the right or left. He was no taller than he had been seven years before but his back and his chest were bowed out in such a manner that they resembled a well hulled sack supported upon two weak little legs. His arms however had grown so long that they hung down almost to his feet and his coarse brown hands were the size of those of a fullgrown man with ugly spiderlike fingers. The handsome lively little Jacob had been changed into an ugly and repulsivelooking dwarf.He thought once more of the morning on which the old witch had fingered his mothers goods and when he had twitted her with her large nose and huge hands. Everything he had found fault with in her she held given him now with the exception of the thin neck for he had no neck at all.Surely you have admired yourself sufficiently said the barber laughingly. Never in my dreams have I seen such a comical fellow as you and I have a proposal to make to you. It is true I have a great many customers but not quite as I had at one time for my rival Barber Lather has come across a giant and has engaged him to stand at his door and invite the people to enter. Now a giant is no very great wonder but you are my little man. Enter into my service and I will give you board and lodging and clothing free and all you will have to do is to stand at my door and ask folks to come in and be shaved and hand the towels soap and so on to the customers. I shall get more customers and you may be sure you will receive a good many coins for yourself.The little fellow was inwardly very much hurt that he should have been invited to act as a barbers decoy but he answered quite politely that he did not wish for such employment and walked out of the shop. His one consolation was that however much the old witch had altered his body she had had no control over his spirit. He felt that his mind had become enlarged and improved and he knew himself to be wiser and more intelligent than he had been seven years previously. He wasted no time in bewailing the loss of his good looks but what did grieve him was the thought that he had been driven like a dog from his fathers door and therefore he determined to make one more effort to convince his mother of his identity.He returned to the marketplace and begged her to listen quietly to him. He reminded her of the day on which the old woman had taken him away and recalled to her many incidents of his childhood. Then he told her how transformed into a squirrel he had served the wicked fairy for seven years and how his present hideous features had been given him because he had found fault with the old womans features. The cobblers wife knew not what to believe. Every detail he had told her of his childhood was correct and yet she could not believe it possible that he could have been changed into a squirrel besides which she did not believe in fairies good or evil.When she looked at the ugly little dwarf she found it impossible to accept him as her son. She thought the best thing that could be done was to talk the matter over with her husband and so she collected her baskets and she and Jacob went back to the cobblers shop. See here she said this fellow declares he is our lost Jacob. He has described to me exactly how he was stolen away seven years ago and how he has been bewitched by a bad fairy.Indeed cried the cobbler angrily he has told you exactly what I told him an hour ago and has tried to take you in with his story. Bewitched was he well I will disenchant this little son of mine. So saying the cobbler took a bundle of leather strappings and seizing poor Jacob whipped him mercifully until the poor fellow screaming with pain managed to make his escape. It is strange how little sympathy is ever shown to an unfortunate being who happens to have anything ridiculous about his appearance.This was the reason that poor Jacob was obliged to pass all that day and night without tasting food and that he had no better couch than the cold steps of a church. But notwithstanding he slept until the morning sun rose and wakened him and then he set himself earnestly to consider how he was to earn a livelihood for himself seeing that this father and mother had cast him off. He was too proud to serve as a barbers sign post or to exhibit himself in a show for money. But remembering how excellently he had learnt to cook when he was in his squirrel form he thought it possible that he might make use of his art now at any rate he determined to try.He remembered to have heard that the Duke who owned that country was said to be very fond of good living and so as soon as the day was sufficiently advanced he made his way to the palace. The porter at the great gateway laughed at him in scorn when he said he wished to see the chief cook but on his persisting he led him across the courtyard all the servants who were about the place stared at him and then followed in his train laughing and jeering at him. They made such an uproar that the steward came out to see what all the noise was about. He carried a whip in his hand and with it he laid about him right and left. You hounds said he how dare you disturb your masters slumbers Dont you know that he is not awake yetBut sir cried the servants look what brings us here. Is that not excuse enough Look at the queer little dwarf we are bringing youAs the steward saw poor Jacob he had hard work to keep from laughing too but as he considered it would be beneath his dignity to join in the mirth with the other servants he managed to restrain himself and driving them off with his whip led Jacob into his own apartments and asked him what he wanted. Jacob begged to be conducted to the head cook but the steward could scarcely believe him.Surely my little man it is to me you wish to apply for a situation. Do you not wish to become the Dukes jesterNo sir replied the dwarf. I am a firstrate cook and understand how to prepare all sorts of delicacies. I thought the head cook might be willing to make use of my art.Every man to his own liking little man  but it seems to me you are rather a foolish fellow. As the Dukes jester you would have had no work to do fine clothes to wear and plenty of good food to eat and drink. Still we will see what we can do for you though I doubt if your cookery is sufficiently good to suit the Dukes table and you are too good to be made a mere scullion of.The steward then led him to the head cook to whom Jacob hastened to offer his services. The head cook took a good look at him and burst out laughing. You a cook indeed he said scornfully. Why you could not reach the top of the stove to stir a pan. Someone has been making game of you in sending you here.But Jacob was not to be put off in this way. Of what account are a few eggs syrup and wine flour and spices in a house like this he said order me to make any tasty dish you can think of and allow me to have the ingredients I require and you shall soon judge whether or no I am a good cook.Well so be it said the head cook and taking the stewards arm he led the way to the kitchen. Just for the joke of the thing we will let the little man do as he wishes.The kitchen was a magnificent place. Fires burned in twenty huge stoves a stream of clear water which served also for a fishpond flowed through the apartment the cupboards which contained the stores mostly in use were of marble and costly wood and there were ten large pantries containing every kind of delicious foods from both Eastern and Western countries. Numbers of servants were running to and fro carrying kettles and pans and spoons and ladles. As the head cook entered they all stood still and there was not a sound to be heard but the crackling of the fires and the rippling of the stream.What has the Duke ordered for his breakfast today the great man  asked of one of the inferior cooks. My lord has been pleased to order Danish soup and red Hamburg patties replied the man.       Very well said the head cook turning to Jacob you hear what his Highness has ordered. Will you undertake to prepare such difficult dishes As to the Hamburg patties you will never be able to make them for the recipe is a secret.There is nothing easier replied the dwarf for as a squirrel cook he had often been called upon to prepare these dishes. For the soup I shall require herbs spices wild boars head certain roots vegetables and eggs and for the patties here he lowered his voice so that only the steward and the head cook could hear him I require four kinds of meat ginger and a sprig of a herb that is known by the name of  trenchermans mint. By my honour as a cook you must have learnt your trade from a magician said the head cook You have hit upon the right ingredients and ihc mint is an addition I never thought of but which will certainly add to the flavour of the dish.Well said the steward I would not have believed it possible but by all means let him have the things he asks for and see how he will manage to prepare the breakfast.As it was found that the dwarf could not reach up to the table a slab of marble was laid across two chairs and all the things he asked for were set upon it. Steward head cook and all the rest of the servants stood around and watched in amazement the clever cleanly and brisk manner in which he prepared the food. When he had mixed everything he ordered the pots to be placed upon the fire and allowed to boil until he said they were to be taken off. Then he began to count  One two three and so on right up to five hundred and then he cried Stop off with the potsThey were immediately taken off the fire and the dwarf begged the head cook to taste the contents. A golden spoon was brought and the head cook approached the stove lifted the lid of one of the pots helped himself to a spoonful of soup then closing his eyes smacked his lips with pleasure and enjoyment.Delicious he murmured by the Dukes head it is delicious. Steward will you not taste it The Steward tasted both soup and patties and then stroked his waistcoat gently with delight. Head cook said he you are an experienced and firstrate cook but never have you made such soup or such patties.The head cook tasted the food again then he reverently shook the dwarf by the hand. Little one said he you are a master of your craft. That pinch of trenchermans herb has given the patties an extra flavour that renders them quite perfect.At this moment the Dukes special attendant came to say that his master was ready for his break fast so the food was served up in silver dishes. The head cook however took the little man into his room and was about to have a talk with him when a message came from the Duke desiring his attendance. He dressed himself in his best clothes and hastened into his masters presence. The Duke was looking extremely pleased. He had finished every morsel of the food set before him and was wiping his beard as the head cook entered.Cook said he I have always been well satisfied with your cooking and with the work of those under you but tell me who prepared my breakfast this morning I declare it has never been so well served since I sat upon the throne of my fathers. I wish to know the cooks name so that I may reward him with a few ducats.My lord it is a most wonderful story answered the head cook and proceeded to tell his master about the dwarf who had arrived that morning and who had insisted upon being engaged as a cook. The Duke was much surprised and sent for Jacob and questioned him close as to his name where he came from and so on. Poor Jacob could not very well own that he had been bewitched and changed into a squirrel but he was not far from the truth when he said he was now without parents and that he had learnt cooking from an old woman.The Duke did not urge him to say more being much taken up with staring at the strange figure and features of his new cook. If you will serve me he said I will pay you fifty ducats a year give you a fine robe and two pairs of breeches. Your duties will be to cook my breakfast every morning order and superintend the preparation of my dinner and take over the entire management of the kitchen. As I always prefer to name my servants myself I shall give you the name of LongNose and your position will be that of second head cook.LongNose fell at the feet of his new master kissed them and vowed to serve him faithfully.  The little fellow was thus provided for and he certainly did honour to his position for the Duke was a different man from the time the dwarf entered his service. Before that time he had been in the habit of throwing the plates and dishes at the head of the cook who did not manage to please him indeed on one occasion he had flung a calfs foot at his head cook because it was not sufficiently tender and catching the poor man on the forehead had hurt him so much that for three days he had to keep his bed. It is true the Duke always paid for his acts of temper afterwards with a handful of ducats but nevertheless his cooks were wont to set the dishes before him in fear and with trembling hands. But since the dwarf had been in the house all had been changed. The master took five meals a day instead of three in order to thoroughly appreciate the skill of his little servant and never had he been dissatisfied yet but had found everything served to him both novel and excellent.He was always in a good temper and grew fatter day by day. Sometimes as he sat at table he would send for his head cook and Jacob and bid them share the delicious food set before him which was considered a very great honour indeed. The dwarf was the wonder of the whole city.. The head cook constantly received entreaties from various personages to be allowed to witness the dwarfs cooking and some of the most distinguished men in the State asked and received permission from the Duke to allow their cooks to take lessons from the little man. They paid him well for the instructions they received but LongNose divided the money between all the other cooks for he did not wish them to become jealous of him. Two whole years the dwarf passed in the Dukes service and was well connt with the treatment he received. It was only the thought of his estrangement from his parents that gave him the least unhappiness. Nothing out of the common had happened to him until the following occurrence took place. He was a better hand at a bargain than most always seeing at a glance which were the best goods on sale and for this reason whenever he had the time he used to go to market himself.One morning he went to the goose fair to buy geese. He was no longer treated with scorn and laughter for everyone knew him to be the Dukes favourite cook and every good wife with geese to sell thought herself lucky if his long nose turned in her direction.He went up and down the marketplace and at length purchased three live geese which were just the size he required. He lifted the basket in which they were placed upon his broad shoulders and turned towards home. It struck him as somewhat strange that only two of the geese cackled and gabbled as geese are wont to do the third was silent except when she heaved a sigh that sounded almost human.The creature must be ill he said aloud.  I had better cook her quickly before she gets worse. Then to his astonishment the goose answered quite plainly  LongNose look thee If thou cook me. No good twill do The deed thoult rue.Frightened out of his wits LongNose set down the cage and the goose looked at him with her beautiful wise eyes and sighed. There there said the dwarf have no fear I would not harm such a wonderful bird as yourself for it is not once in a lifetime that one meets a goose that can talk. I wager you have not always worn feathers I myself have been bewitched and turned into a squirrel and I expect it is the same with you.You are right said the goose. Alas I did not always bear this humble form and at my birth who would have dared prophecy that Mimi the daughter of the great magician Wetterbock would end her days in a Dukes kitchen.Set your mind at rest dear Miss Mimi said the dwarf consolingly  so sure as I am an honest fellow and second cook to his Highness no one shall do you any harm. I will have a coop placed for you in my own apartment and you shall have as much food as you require and I will devote all my spare time to you. The rest of the kitchen servants will be told that I am fattening you on some particular herbs to give you a specially good flavour and I will take the first opportunity of setting you at liberty.The goose thanked him with tears in her eyes and the dwarf took means to provide for her as he had promised. She was placed in a wicker cage and fed by LongNose alone and he took care instead of giving her the ordinary food required by geese to serve her with dainty cakes and sweets. As often as he could he sat and talked to her and tried to comfort her. They told each other their sad stories and in this way LongNose learned that Mimi was the daughter of the great magician Wetterbock who lived on the island of Gothland. He had quarrelled with a very wicked fairy who had managed to outwit him and in revenge to change Mimi into a goose and bring her far away from her home.The dwarf in return told her all his adventures and she said I am not altogether ignorant of magic myself having learnt some things from my father. What you tell me about the quarrel over the herb basket and your sudden transformation on smelling a certain herb proves to me that the old woman used some herb in her enchantment and if vou are able to find that herb you will probably regain your natural form.This was small comfort for LongNose for he had not the least idea where he could find such a herb. Still he thanked her and tried to be a little more hopeful too. It was just at this time that the Duke had a visit from a neighbouring Prince a friend of his. He sent for LongNose and said to him Now is the time to prove if you serve me faithfully and are a true master of your art. This Prince who is now my guest lives better than anyone I know except myself. He prides himself upon the firstrate cooks he keeps and he is a very knowing man. Now be careful that my table is served daily with such dishes that may arouse his astonishment and envy. Never let the same kind of food appear twice during his visit. You may ask my treasurer for as much money as you require to purchase materials for your cooking. If you wanted to baste your roasts with gold and diamonds you should have them. I would sooner beggar myself than have to blush for the quality of my viands.The dwarf bowed and promised the Duke that he would so manage that the dainty palate of the Prince could not fail to approve of the dishes set before him. The little cook exerted all his skill and spared neither his masters treasures nor himself. All day long he was enveloped in a cloud of steam out of which issued his voice giving orders to the other cooks and scullions. It would take too long to recount all the delicious foods he cooked suffice it to say that for a whole fortnight the Duke and his guest were served as they had never been served before and a smile of enjoyment was constantly to be seen upon the face of the royal visitor.At the end of that time the Duke sent for the dwarf and presented him to the Prince asking him at the same time what he thought of him as a cook. You are indeed a wonderful cook said the noble visitor to the little man. During the whole of my stay here I have not had the same kind of dish twice. But I must own I have been surprised that you have never tempted our appetites with the queen of all dainties a Souzeraine pasty.The dwarf was rather upset for it chanced that he had never heard of this before but he managed to hide his discomposure. Sir said he I had hoped you were to honour this court with your presence for a long time yet and therefore did I delay setting this dish before you for with what better dish could a cook serve you as a parting greeting than with that of a Souzeraine pastyOh indeed said the Duke smiling so I suppose you were waiting for me to leave the world for ever before giving me the parting greeting for I have never so much as heard of this pasty much less tasted it. But we will wait for it no longer to morrow morning we shall expect you to serve it up to us for breakfast.As my lord wills answered the dwarf and bowing low he left their presence. He was terribly upset for he had not the least idea how to make the pasty. He went to his room and there wept and bemoaned his sad fate. But the goose Mimi came to him and after enquiring the cause of his sorrow said Dry your tears for I think I can help you in this matter. This dish was frequently set upon my fathers table and I  know pretty well how it was concocted. Even if I cannot tell you every single ingredient you will no doubt flavour the pie so deliciously that the Prince will not detect any omission.She then proceeded to name to the dwarf the various ingredients required. He was ready to jump for joy and blessed the day upon which he had purchased the goose and then set to work to make the pasty. He made a little trial one to begin with and it tasted delicious. He gave the head cook a piece to taste and he could not say enough in praise of it. The following morning he made a large one and sent it to table decorated with wreaths of flowers. He dressed himself in his state robes and entered the dining hall just as the carver had served the Duke and his guest with slices of the pasty. The Duke took a large mouthful and then cast his eyes up towards the ceiling. Ah said he as soon as he could speak this has been truly called the queen of pasties and as for my cook he is the king of cooks. What say you dear friendThe guest took one or two mouthfuls before answering and then having tasted the flavour he said rather scornfullv as he pushed away his plate It is as I thought It is an excellent pasty no doubt hut not the Souzeraine.The Duke frowned and reddened with anger  Dog of a dwarf cried he how dare you treat me so I have a good mind to have your head chopped off as a punishment for your bad cookery.My lord I assure you I have made the pasty according to all the rules of the art of cookery replied the dwarf trembling.It is false you rascal replied the Duke kicking him away. If it were right my guest would not say it was wrong. I have a good mind to have you made into mincemeat and baked in a pie yourself.Have mercy cried the poor little man prostrating himself before the royal guest and clasping his feet in his arms. I pray you tell me what I have left out of the pasty that it fails to suit your palate Do not condemn me to death for a handful of meat and flour.It will be of little assistance to you to know my dear LongNose answered the Prince with a smile I was quite certain yesterday that you would not be able to make this pastry as well as my cook can because the chief requisite is a herb which does not grow in this country. It is known as The Cooks Delight and without this the pasty is practically tasteless and your master will never eat it with the same pleasure that I can in my own country.Then the Duke flew into the most terrible rage I vow by my honour that either you shall taste this jjasty tomorrow morning exactly as you are accustomed to have it or else the head of this fellow shall pay for his blunder. Go dog of a dwarf I give you fourandtwenty hours to accomplish it in.The poor dwarf went to his room and told this fresh trouble to the goose. Come take heart said she fortunately I know every herb that grows and I am sure I can find this one for you. It is a happy thing that it chances to be a new moon tonight for only at the time of the new moon does this plant grow. But tell me are there any ancient chestnut trees near the palaceOh  yes replied the dwarf with a lighter heart. Two hundred paces from the palace beside the lake there is quite a large group of chestnut trees but why do you askBecause the herb is only found at the root of very old chestnut trees answered Mimi. Let us lose no time but go and search for what you require. Take me under your arm and put me down when we have reached the spot and I will help you search.He did as she bade him but as he would have passed out of the gateway of the palace the sentry barred the way with his lance. My good Long Nose said he I have the strictest orders not to let you out of the house. Your end has come I fear. But surely I can go into the garden replied the dwarf. Be so good as to send one of your comrades to enquire if I may go into the garden to search for herbs.The sentry did so and permission was given for the garden had such high walls surrounding it that it seemed impossible for him to escape. As soon as he was in the open he placed Mimi carefully on the ground and she at once began to run towards the lake on the banks of which the chestnut trees grew. LongNose followed her with a sinking heart for he had already made up his mind that if the herb could not be found he would drown himself in the lake rather than allow his head to be cut off. The goose sought in vain for the herb she left not a blade of grass unturned and at length she began to cry from sympathy. She would not  give up the search until evening began to fall and the darkness made it difficult to distinguish any surrounding objects.Just as they were about to abandon the search the dwarf looked across the lake and then cried out Look at the other side of the lake is a huge old chestnut tree. Let us go and search there perhaps good fortune blooms yonder. The goose waddled and flew and waddled and flew the dwarf hurrying after her as fast as his little legs would let him until at length they had reached the other side of the lake. The chestnut tree cast a vast shade and it was so dark all around that it was difficult to distinguish anything but suddenly the goose gave a cry of joy and flapped her wings with delight. She thrust her head into the long grass and plucked something which she deftly offered in her bill to LongNose.This is the herb said she and it grows here in such quantities you will always have a plentiful supply. The dwarf looked at the herb thoughtfully. A sweet scent assailed his nostrils and reminded him of the scene of his transformation the stalk too of the plant was of a bluishgreen colour and it bore a bright red flower flecked with yellow.Mimi said he by great good fortune I do believe we have chanced upon the very herb that changed me from a squirrel into the creature I am now. Shall I make a trial of itNot yet replied the goose. Take a handful of the herbs with you and let us go back to your room. There you can collect your money and all that you possess and then we will try the power of the herb.They returned to the dwarfs room he with a heart beating loudly with excitement. He took  between fifty and sixty ducats he had saved and tied them up in a bundle with some of his clothes then saying  May good fortune aid me to be rid of my burden he thrust his nose into the bunch of herbs and sniffed their fragrance. Then his limbs and joints began to crack and stretch he could feel his head rising from between his shoulders squinting down his nose he could see it growing smaller and smaller his back and chest straightened themselves out. and his legs became longer. The goose looked on in astonishment. Oh how tall and handsome you are she cried there is not the faintest resemblance left to the dwarf LongNose.As for Jacob he was beside himself with joy but he did not forget the thanks he owed to Mimi. His first impulse was to go to his parents but gratitude urged him to supress this wish. But for you he said to Mimi I might have retained my hideous form all the days of my life or I might even have lost my life. Now is the time to repay my debt. I will take you straightway to your father whose magic powers will at once enable him to disenchant you.The goose wept tears of joy and accepted his offer gratefully. Jacob passed the sentries safely for the had only been ordered to bar the way to the dwarf LongXose. With Mimi beneath his arm he very soon reached the seashore and before long her home was in sight. The great Wetterbock soon turned the goose into a charming young lady and having loaded her rescuer with valuable gifts bade him farewell. Jacob hastened home and his parents were only too delighted to accept the handsome young man as their longlost son. With the presents he had received from Wetterbock he was able to purchase a shop and he became a very rich man and lived happily all his days. But his disappearance from the Dukes palace caused a great hubbub.When the morning came on which the Duke was to fulfil his vow and behead the dwarf if he had not found the herb lo the dwarf himself was missing. The Prince declared the Duke had allowed him to escape to avoid losing such a splendid cook and said he had broken his word. They quarrelled so violently that a war ensued which is known in all histories of those lands as The Herb War and when at length peace was declared it was called The Pasty Peace and at the reconciliation feast the Princes cook served up a Souzeraine pasty to which the Duke did full justice.
An honest Hampshire farmer was sore distressed by the nightly unsettling of his barn. However straightly over night he laid his sheaves on the threshing floor for the application of the mornings flail when morning came all was topsyturvy higgledypiggledy though the door remained locked and there was no sign whatever of irregular entry.I weat you weat I sweat do you sweatHodge could contain himself no longer. He leapt out cryingThe deuce sweat ye Let me get among ye.The fairies all flew away so frightened that they never disturbed the barn any more.
In a certain kingdom there once served in the kings army a soldier. He served him honestly and faithfully for twentyfive years. For his good service the king gave him a leave of absence and presented him with his warhorse and armor. The soldier bade farewell to his comrades and went home. He traveled one day another day a third day and a whole week. The soldier had no money to buy food for himself or for his horse and his home was still very far off. He was very hungry and tired. He looked all around and saw a large and beautiful castle.Well thought he I will try to enter it perhaps they will take me into service and I can earn something.He entered the castle put his horse in the stable gave it food and went to the palace. In one of the rooms a table was set with the best foods and drinks a person could wish for. He ate and drank and thought of taking a rest.Suddenly a bear entered. Do not be afraid young man. You can do me some good. I am not a frightful bear I am a fair maiden an enchanted princess. If you will pass three nights here my enchantment will be broken and I will marry you.The soldier consented. The bear left and he was all alone. He felt so sad. A great anxiety took hold of him and he felt such a longing to depart that he almost lost his mind. The third night he decided to leave the castle and to flee. But no matter how he looked and searched he could find no way of escape. He had to remain in the castle against his will. In the morning the princess came in. She was as beautiful as a dream. She thanked him for the service and told him to get ready for the wedding. The wedding was celebrated and they lived happily together.After some time the soldier thought of his old home and wanted to visit it.Stay here my friend Do not go. Arent you happy here asked the princess.But the soldier insisted upon going to see his old parents. Before departing his wife gave him a small bag full of seeds. Wherever you go throw these seeds on both sides of the road wherever they fall trees will grow up upon the trees rare fruits will grow beautiful birds will sing.The soldier mounted his good old horse and departed. Wherever he went he threw the magic seeds and after him forests rose as if creeping out of the earth. On the third evening of his journey in the middle of an open field he saw a group of men sitting upon the grass playing cards. Near them a kettle was hanging and though there was no fire under it the soup inside was boiling.What a wonder thought the soldier. No fire is to be seen yet the kettle is boiling hot. Let me look at it. He turned his horse approached the men and said Good evening honest people. You have a wonderful thing a kettle boiling without fire but I have something more wonderful.He took out one seed and threw it upon the ground. In a minute a tree grew up rare fruit upon its branches wonderful birds singing beautiful songs. Now the soldier did not know that these men were the magicians that had enchanted the princess his wife. They recognized him.Oh said they that is the same fellow who saved the princess. Let us make him sleep for half a year.They treated him with an enchanted drink. The soldier immediately fell fast asleep and the men with the kettle disappeared.Soon after this the princess took a walk in her garden. There she saw that all the treetops were dry and dead. That foretells me nothing good thought she. Something wrong must have happened to my husband. He has been away for three months already. It is time for him to come back and as yet I have heard nothing of him. She decided then to go to look for him.She went by the same road over which the soldier had gone. On both sides forests were growing and birds were singing. But after a while she reached the place where there were no more trees. The road was clearly marked in the open field. She thought Where could my husband have gone I hope he has not been swallowed up by the earth. She looked around and saw aside from the road a wonderful tree and under it her husband. She ran to him shook him called him but could not wake him up. She pinched him stuck pins into his body but he felt no pain. He was lying as one dead and did not move.The princess became angry and in her anger she cursed him. O you wretched sleepyhead I wish a storm would raise you and carry you off far away to unknown countriesHardly had she spoken these words when raging winds came blowing and whistling and raised the soldier and carried him off before the princess eyes. The princess felt sorry for her bad words but it was too late. She cried bitterly but could not get her husband back. She returned to her palace and lived there a sad and lonely life.The poor soldier was carried by the wind through many lands and seas and was thrown upon a very lonely sandbank between two seas. If in his sleep he should turn to his right or to his left he would fall into the sea and perish. For half a year he slept and did not move a finger. When he awoke he jumped straight upon his feet and looked around. From both sides the waves were rising and there was no end to the waters. He asked himself in surprise How did I come here Who brought me hitherHe went along the bank and came to an island. There he saw a very high and steep mountain. Its top reached the clouds. Upon it there was a large stone. He approached the mountain and saw at its foot three men fighting. They were the sons of a malicious magician.What is the matter asked the soldier. What are you fighting forYou see answered they our father died and left us three wonderful things a flying carpet sevenleague boots and an invisible cap. But we cannot divide them peaceably.O you silly magicians Stop your fighting If you wish I will divide the things between you so that everyone shall be satisfied.The magicians consented.Now said the soldier do you see that large stone upon the mountain top Climb up to it push it down the mountain and run after it whoever shall reach the stone first shall choose among the three wonders the second one between the two wonders and the third shall take that which shall be left.The magicians climbed up pushed the stone and ran after it. It was rolling down very quickly. One reached it seized upon itthe stone turned over fell upon him and killed him. The same happened to the other two magicians.The soldier took the sevenleague boots the invisible cap sat down upon the flying carpet and went to look for his kingdom. After some time he came to a hut and entered. An old fairy lived there.Good morning grandmother Tell me how to find my dear little princess.I do not know my dear I have never seen her nor heard of her. Go to the other side of the ocean. There lives my older sister. She knows more than I do perhaps she will tell you.The soldier flew upon his carpet to the older fairy. The journey was very long. When he felt hungry or thirsty he had only to put on his invisible cap go to the shops and there he had everything he wished. At last he came to the older fairy.Good morning grandmother. Cant you tell me how to find my beautiful princessNo dear I cant tell you. But you cross many oceans and many lands until you reach the end of the world. There lives my oldest sister perhaps she knows about the princess.At last he flew to the end of the world where there was no hut and no road beyond. Illustration by Maurice Day published in Wonder Tales from Russia by Jeremiah Curtin 1921 Little Brown and Company.The soldier felt very much discouraged but he was anxious to find his wife. He went then to look for the oldest fairy. He traveled for a very very long time over many seas and many lands until he came to the end of the world. A single hut was standing and beyond it nothing could be seen but thick darkness.Well thought the soldier sadly if I dont find out anything here I can fly no further.He went into the hut. There he saw an old old fairy. Her teeth had fallen out her hair was white like snow. She was half blind and lame.Good morning grandmother Tell me please where to find my princessWait awhile said the fairy. I will call all the winds and ask them. They blow all over the world so they must know where she lives.She went out upon the porch and called in a loud voice. Suddenly from all sides raging winds arose and blew so that the hut trembled. Be calmer cried she and said O you my raging winds you blow all over the world have you seen anywhere the beautiful princessNo we have not seen her answered all the winds.Are you all hereAll but the South Wind.After a short time the South Wind came. The old fairy asked him angrily Where were you until now I have been waiting impatiently for you.Pardon me grandmother I went into a new kingdom where a beautiful princess lives. Her husband disappeared no one knows where. Now different kings and princes come to woo her.And how far is it to that kingdomIt will take thirty years to walk thither ten years to fly upon wings and if I blow I can carry one over in three hours.Then the soldier with tears in his eyes begged the South Wind to carry him to his princess.Well said the South Wind I will do it if you will allow me to blow in your kingdom for three days and three nights.You may blow for three weeks if you like.All right. Let me take a rest of three days. I will gather my strength and then we will go.The South Wind rested and then said to the soldier Now my friend get ready for the journey but do not be afraid I will not hurt youSuddenly the strong wind whistled and blew the soldier was raised in the air and carried over mountains and seas right under the clouds and in just three hours he was in the new kingdom where the beautiful princess lived.The South Wind said Goodbye young man I pity you and do not want to blow in your kingdom.The young prince asked Why soBecause if I begin to blow not one house will be left in the cities not one tree in the gardens. I will overthrow everything.Goodbye South Wind Thank you for your service to me said the soldier put on his invisible cap and went into the palace.All the time while he had been away the trees had been standing with dried and faded tops now when he appeared again they revived and began to blossom. He entered the large room. Around the table there were sitting all the many kings and princes that had come to woo the princess feasting. When one of them put the wineglass to his lips the soldier hit upon the glass and broke it. All the guests were surprised but the beautiful princess guessed the meaning of it immediately.My husband must have come back thought she. She looked through the window into the garden. There all the trees were alive again and covered with blossoms. So she gave to her guests a riddle to solve I had a wonderful handmade casket with a golden key to it. I had lost my key and had never expected to find it and suddenly the key has found itself. Whoever shall guess the riddle shall be my husband.All the kings and princes tried in vain to solve it. Then the princess said Come out and show yourself my belovedThe soldier took off his invisible cap took the white hands of the princess and kissed her sweet lips.Here is the key to my riddle said the fair princess. The casket is myself and the golden key is my faithful husband.All the wooers had to go home with nothing and the princess and the soldier lived happily ever after.
Once there lived a handsome young man named Ram Singh who though a favourite with everyone was unhappy because he had a scold for a stepmother. All day long she went on talking until the youth was driven so distracted that he determined to go away somewhere and seek his fortune. No sooner had he decided to leave his home than he made his plans and the very next morning he started off with a few clothes in a wallet and a little money in his pocket.But there was one person in the village to whom he wished to say goodbye and that was a wise old guru or teacher who had taught him much. So he turned his face first of all towards his masters hut and before the sun was well up was knocking at his door. The old man received his pupil affectionately but he was wise in reading faces and saw at once that the youth was in trouble.My son said he what is the matter Nothing father replied the young man but I have determined to go into the world and seek my fortune.Be advised returned the guru and remain in your fathers house it is better to have half a loaf at home than to seek a whole one in distant countries.But Ram Singh was in no mood to heed such advice and very soon the old man ceased to press him.Well said he at last if your mind is made up I suppose you must have your way. But listen carefully and remember five parting counsels which I will give you and if you keep these no evil shall befall you. First  always obey without question the orders of him whose service you enter second  never speak harshly or unkindly to anyone third  never lie fourth  never try to appear the equal of those above you in station and fifth  wherever you go if you meet those who read or teach from the holy books stay and listen if but for a few minutes that you may be strengthened in the path of duty.Then Ram Singh started out upon his journey promising to bear in mind the old mans words.After some days he came to a great city. He had spent all the money which he had at starting and therefore resolved to look for work however humble it might be. Catching sight of a prosperouslooking merchant standing in front of a shop full of grain of all kinds Ram Singh went up to him and asked whether he could give him anything to do. The merchant gazed at him so long that the young man began to lose heart but at length he answeredYes of course there is a place waiting for you.What do you mean asked Ram Singh.Why replied the other yesterday our rajahs chief wazir dismissed his body servant and is wanting another. Now you are just the sort of person that he needs for you are young and tall and handsome I advise you to apply there.Thanking the merchant for this advice the young man set out at once for the wazirs house and soon managed thanks to his good looks and appearance to be engaged as the great mans servant.One day soon after this the rajah of the place started on a journey and the chief wazir accompanied him. With them was an army of servants and attendants soldiers muleteers cameldrivers merchants with grain and stores for man and beast singers to make entertainment by the way and musicians to accompany them besides elephants camels horses mules ponies donkeys goats and carts and wagons of every kind and description so that it seemed more like a large town on the march than anything else.Thus they travelled for several days till they entered a country that was like a sea of sand where the swirling dust floated in clouds and men and beasts were half choked by it. Towards the close of that day they came to a village and when the headmen hurried out to salute the rajah and to pay him their respects they began with very long and serious faces to explain that whilst they and all that they had were of course at the disposal of the rajah the coming of so large a company had nevertheless put them into a dreadful difficulty because they had never a well nor spring of water in their country and they had no water to give drink to such an army of men and beasts Great fear fell upon the host at the words of the headmen but the rajah merely told the wazir that he must get water somehow and that settled the matter so far as he was concerned. The wazir sent off in haste for all the oldest men in the place and began to question them as to whether there were no wells near by.They all looked helplessly at each other and said nothing but at length one old greybeard repliedTruly Sir Wazir there is within a mile or two of this village a well which some former king made hundreds of years ago. It is they say great and inexhaustible covered in by heavy stonework and with a flight of steps leading down to the water in the very bowels of the earth but no man ever goes near it because it is haunted by evil spirits and it is known that whoso disappears down the well shall never be seen again.The wazir stroked his beard and considered a moment. Then he turned to Ram Singh who stood behind his chair.There is a proverb said he that no man can be trusted until he has been tried. Go you and get the rajah and his people water from this well.Then there flashed into Ram Singhs mind the first counsel of the old guru   Always obey without question the orders of him whose service you enter. So he replied at once that be was ready and left to prepare for his adventure. Two great brazen vessels he fastened to a mule two lesser ones he bound upon his shoulders and thus provided he set out with the old villager for his guide. In a short time they came to a spot where some big trees towered above the barren country whilst under their shadow lay the dome of an ancient building. This the guide pointed out as the well but excused himself from going further as he was an old man and tired and it was already nearly sunset so that he must be returning home. So Ram Singh bade him farewell and went on alone with the mule.Arrived at the trees Ram Singh tied up his beast lifted the vessels from his shoulder and having found the opening of the well descended by a flight of steps which led down into the darkness. The steps were broad white slabs of alabaster which gleamed in the shadows as he went lower and lower. All was very silent. Even the sound of his bare feet upon the pavement seemed to wake an echo in that lonely place and when one of the vessels which he carried slipped and fell upon the steps it clanged so loudly that he jumped at the noise. Still he went on until at last he reached a wide pool of sweet water and there he washed his jars with care before he filled them and began to remount the steps with the lighter vessels as the big ones were so heavy he could only take up one at a time. Suddenly something moved above him and looking up he saw a great giant standing on the stairway  In one hand he held clasped to his heart a dreadful looking mass of bones in the other was a lamp which cast long shadows about the walls and made him seem even more terrible than he really was.What think you O mortal said the giant of my fair and lovely wife  And he held the light towards the bones in his arms and looked lovingly at them.Now I must tell you that this poor giant had had a very beautiful wife whom he had loved dearly but when she died her husband refused to believe in her death and always carried her about long after she had become nothing but bones. Ram Singh of course did not know of this but there came to his mind the second wise saying of the guru which forbade him to speak harshly or inconsiderately to others so he repliedTruly sir I am sure you could find nowhere such another.Ah what eyes you have  cried the delighted giant. you at least can see  I do not know how often I have slain those who insulted her by saying she was but dried bones  You are a fine young man and I will help you.So saying he laid down the bones with great tenderness and snatching up the huge brass vessels carried them up again and replaced them with such ease that it was all done by the time that Ram Singh had reached. the open air with the smaller ones.Now said the giant you have pleased me and you may ask of me one favour and whatever you wish I will do it for you. Perhaps you would like me to show you where lies buried the treasure of dead kings  he added eagerly.But Ram Singh shook his head at the mention of buried wealth.The favour that I would ask said he is that you will leave off haunting this well so that men may go in and out and obtain water.Perhaps the giant expected some favour more difficult to grant for his face brightened and he promised to depart at once and as Ram Singh went off through the gathering darkness with his precious burden of water he beheld the giant striding away with the bones of his dead wife in his arms.Great was the wonder and rejoicing in the camp when Ram Singh returned with the water. He never said anything however about his adventure with the giant but merely told the rajah that there was nothing to prevent the well being used and used it was and nobody ever saw any more of the giant.The rajah was so pleased with the bearing of Ram Singh that he ordered the wazir to give the young man to him in exchange for one of his own servants. So Ram Singh became the rajahs attendant and as the days went by the king became more and more delighted with the youth because mindful of the old gurus third counsel he was always honest and spoke the truth. He grew in favour rapidly until at last the rajah made him his treasurer and thus he reached a high place in the court and had wealth and power in his hands. Unluckily the rajah had a brother who was a very bad man and this brother thought that if he could win the young treasurer over to himself he might by this means manage to steal little by little any of the kings treasure which he needed. Then with plenty of money he could bribe the soldiers and some of the rajahs counsellors head a rebellion dethrone and kill his brother and reign himself instead. He was too wary of course to tell Ram Singh of all these wicked plans but he began by flattering him whenever he saw him and at last offered him his daughter in marriage. But Ram Singh remembered the fourth counsel of the old guru  never to try to appear the equal of those above him in station  therefore he respectfully declined the great honour of marrying a princess. Of course the prince baffled at the very beginning of his enterprise was furious and determined to work Ram Singhs ruin and entering the rajahs presence he told him a story about Ram Singh having spoken insulting words of his sovereign and of his daughter. What it was all about nobody knew and as it was not true the wicked prince did not know either but the rajah grew very angry and red in the face as he listened and declared that until the treasurers head was cut off neither he nor the princess nor his brother would eat or drink.But added he I do not wish anyone to know that this was done by my desire and anyone who mentions the subject will be severely punished. And with this the prince was forced to be content.Then the rajah sent for an officer of his guard and told him to take some soldiers and ride at once to a tower which was situated just outside the town and if anyone should come to inquire when the building was going to be finished or should ask any other questions about it the officer must chop his head off and bring it to him. As for the body that could be buried on the spot. The old officer thought these instructions rather odd but it was no business of his so he saluted and went off to do his masters bidding.Early in the morning the rajah who had not slept all night sent for Ram Singh and bade him go to the new huntingtower and ask the people there how it was getting on and when it was going to be finished and to hurry back with the answer  Away went Ram Singh upon his errand but on the road as he was passing a little temple on the outskirts of the city he heard someone inside reading aloud and remembering the gurus fifth counsel he just stepped inside and sat down to listen for a minute. He did not mean to stay longer but became so deeply interested in the wisdom of the teacher that he sat and sat and sat while the sun rose higher and higher.In the meantime the wicked prince who dared not disobey the rajahs command was feeling very hungry and as for the princess she was quietly crying in a corner waiting for the news of Ram Singhs death so that she might eat her breakfast.Hours passed and stare as he might from the window no messenger could be seen.At last the prince could bear it no longer and hastily disguising himself so that no one should recognise him he jumped on a horse and galloped out to the huntingtower where the rajah had told him that the execution was to take place. But when he got there there was no execution going on. There were only some men engaged in building and a number of soldiers idly watching them. He forgot that he had disguised himself and that no one would know him so riding up he cried outNow then you men why are you idling about here instead of finishing what you came to do  When is it to be done At his words the soldiers looked at the commanding officer who was standing a little apart from the rest. Unperceived by the prince he made a slight sign a sword flashed in the sun and off flew a head on the ground beneath As part of the princes disguise had been a thick beard the men did not recognise the dead man as the rajahs brother but they wrapped the head in a cloth and buried the body as their commander bade them. When this was ended the officer took the cloth and rode off in the direction of the palace.Meanwhile the rajah came home from his council and to his great surprise found neither head nor brother awaiting him as time passed on he became uneasy and thought that he had better go himself and see what the matter was. So ordering his horse he rode off alone.It happened that just as the rajah came near to the temple where Ram Singh still sat the young treasurer hearing the sound of a horses hoofs looked over his shoulder and saw that the rider was the rajah himself  Feeling much ashamed of himself for having forgotten his errand he jumped up and hurried out to meet his master who reined up his horse and seemed very surprised as indeed he was to see him. At that moment there arrived the officer of the guard carrying his parcel. He saluted the rajah gravely and dismounting laid the bundle in the road and began to undo the wrappings whilst the rajah watched him with wonder and interest. When the last string was undone and the head of his brother was displayed to his view the rajah sprang from his horse and caught the soldier by the arm. As soon as he could speak he questioned the man as to what had occurred and little by little a dark suspicion darted through him. Then briefly telling the soldier that he had done well the rajah drew Ram Singh to one side and in a few minutes learned from him how in attending to the gurus counsel he had delayed to do the kings message.In the end the rajah found from some papers the proofs of his dead brothers treachery and Ram Singh established his innocence and integrity. He continued to serve the rajah for many years with unswerving fidelity and married a maiden of his own rank in life with whom he lived happily dying at last honoured and loved by all men. Sons were born to him and in time to them also he taught the five wise sayings of the old guru.Guru. A Hindu religious teacher or saint in this case a Sikh.
You must know that Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus Christ. Now when Judas betrayed him his Master said Repent Judas for I pardon you. But Judas not at all he departed with his bag of money in despair and cursing heaven and earth. What did he do While he was going along thus desperate he came across a tamarindtree. You must know that the tamarind was formerly a large tree like the olive and walnut. When he saw this tamarind a wild thought entered his mind remembering the treason he had committed. He made a noose in a rope and hung himself to the tamarind. And hence it is because this traitor Judas was cursed by God that the tamarindtree dried up and from that time on it ceased growing up into a tree and became a short twisted and tangled bush and its wood is good for nothing neither to burn nor to make anything out of and all on account of Judas who hanged himself on it.Some say that the soul of Judas went to the lowest hell to suffer the most painful torments but I have heard from older persons who can know that Judass soul has a severer sentence. They say that it is in the air always wandering about the world without being able to rise higher or fall lower and every day on all the tamarind shrubs that it meets it sees its body hanging and torn by the dogs and birds of prey. They say that the pain he suffers cannot be told and that it makes the flesh creep to think of it. And thus Jesus Christ condemned him for his great treason.
In the lower part of the township of Cavendish Vermont the Black River seeks a lower level through a gorge in the foothills of the Green Mountains. The scenery here is romantic and impressive for the river makes its way along the ravine in a series of falls and rapids that are overhung by trees and ledges while the geologist finds something worth looking at in the caves and potholes that indicate an older level of the river. At a turn in the ravine rises the sheer precipice of Lovers Leap. It is a vertical descent of about eighty feet the water swirling at its foot in a black and angry maelstrom. It is a spot whence lovers might easily step into eternity were they so disposed and the name fits delightfully into the wild and somber scene but ask any good villager thereabout to relate the legend of the place and he will tell you thisAbout forty years ago a couple of young farmers went to the Leapwhich then had no nameto pry out some blocks of the schistose rock for a foundation wall. They found a good exposure of the rock beneath the turf and began to quarry it. In the earnestness of the work one of the men forgot that he was standing on the verge of a precipice and through a slip of his crowbar he lost his balance and went reeling into the gulf. His horrified companion crept to the edge expecting to see his mangled corpse tossing in the whirlpool but to his amazement the unfortunate was crawling up the face of a huge table of stone that had fallen from the opposite wall and lay canted against it.Hello shouted the man overhead. Are you hurt muchThe victim of the accident slowly got upon his feet felt cautiously of his legs and ribs and began to search through his pockets his face betraying an anxiety that grew deeper and deeper as the search went on. In due time the answer came back deliberate sad and nasal but distinct above the roar of the torrent Waal I aint hurt much but Ill be durned if I havent lost my jackknifeAnd he was pulled out of the gorge without it.
A legend of the volcano of Canlaon on the island of Negros. It is told generally in Western Negros and Eastern Cebu. The volcano is still active and smoke and steam rises from its crater.Long before the strange men came over the water from Spain there lived in Negros on the mountain of Canlaon an old man who had great power over all the things in the earth. He was called Harisaboqued King of the Mountain.When he wished anything done he had but to tap the ground three times and instantly a number of little men would spring from the earth to answer his call. They would obey his slightest wish but as he was a kind old man and never told his dwarfs to do anything wrong the people who lived near were not afraid. They planted tobacco on the mountain side and were happy and prosperousThe fields stretched almost to the top of the mountain and the plants grew well for every night Harisaboqued would order his dwarfs to attend to them and though the tobacco was high up it grew faster and better than that planted in the valley below.The people were very grateful to the old man and were willing to do anything for him but he only asked them not to plant above a line he had ordered his little men to draw around the mountain near the top. He wished that place for himself and his dwarfs.All obeyed his wish and no one planted over the line. It was a pretty sight to see the long rows of tobacco plants extending from the towns below far up to the line on the mountain side.One day Harisaboqued called the people together and told them that he was going away for a long time. He asked them again not to plant over the line and told them that if they disregarded this wish he would carry all the tobacco away and permit no more to grow on the mountain side until he had smoked what he had taken. The people promised faithfully to obey him. Then he tapped on the ground the earth opened and he disappeared into the mountain.Many years passed and Harisaboqued did not come back. All wondered why he did not return and at last decided that he would never do so. The whole mountain side was covered with tobacco and many of the people looked with greedy eyes at the bare ground above the line but as yet they were afraid to break their promise.At last one man planted in the forbidden ground and as nothing happened others did the same until soon the mountain was entirely covered with the waving plants. The people were very happy and soon forgot about Harisaboqued and their promise to him.But one day while they were laughing and singing the earth suddenly opened and Harisaboqued sprang out before them. They were very much frightened and fled in terror down the mountain side. When they reached the foot and looked back they saw a terrible sight. All the tobacco had disappeared and instead of the thousands of plants that they had tended so carefully nothing but the bare mountain could be seen.Then suddenly there was a fearful noise and the whole mountain top flew high in the air leaving an immense hole from which poured fire and smoke.The people fled and did not stop until they were far away. Harisaboqued had kept his word.Many years have come and gone but the mountain is bare and the smoke still rolls out of the mountain top. Villages have sprung up along the sides but no tobacco is grown on the mountain. The people remember the tales of the former great crops and turn longing eyes to the heights above them but they will have to wait. Harisaboqued is still smoking his tobacco.
At the time of the great famine all the animals were very thin and weak from want of food but there was one exception and that was the tortoise and all his family who were quite fat and did not seem to suffer at all. Even the leopard was very thin in spite of the arrangement he had made with the animals to bring him their old grandmothers and mothers for food.In the early days of the famine as you will remember the leopard had killed the mother of the tortoise in consequence of which the tortoise was very angry with the leopard and determined if possible to be revenged upon him. The tortoise who was very clever had discovered a shallow lake full of fish in the middle of the forest and every morning he used to go to the lake and without much trouble bring back enough food for himself and his family. One day the leopard met the tortoise and noticed how fat he was. As he was very thin himself he decided to watch the tortoise so the next morning he hid himself in the long grass near the tortoises house and waited very patiently until at last the tortoise came along quite slowly carrying a basket which appeared to be very heavy. Then the leopard sprang out and said to the tortoiseWhat have you got in that basketThe tortoise as he did not want to lose his breakfast replied that he was carrying firewood back to his home. Unfortunately for the tortoise the leopard had a very acute sense of smell and knew at once that there was fish in the basket so he saidI know there is fish in there and I am going to eat it.The tortoise not being in a position to refuse as he was such a poor creature saidVery well. Let us sit down under this shady tree and if you will make a fire I will go to my house and get pepper oil and salt and then we will feed together.To this the leopard agreed and began to search about for dry wood and started the fire. In the meantime the tortoise waddled off to his house and very soon returned with the pepper salt and oil he also brought a long piece of cane tietie which is very strong. This he put on the ground and began boiling the fish. Then he said to the leopardWhile we are waiting for the fish to cook let us play at tying one another up to a tree. You may tie me up first and when I say Tighten you must loose the rope and when I say Loosen you must tighten the rope.The leopard who was very hungry thought that this game would make the time pass more quickly until the fish was cooked so he said he would play. The tortoise then stood with his back to the tree and said Loosen the rope and the leopard in accordance with the rules of the game began to tie up the tortoise. Very soon the tortoise shouted out Tighten and the leopard at once unfastened the tietie and the tortoise was free. The tortoise then said Now leopard it is your turn so the leopard stood up against the tree and called out to the tortoise to loosen the rope and the tortoise at once very quickly passed the rope several times round the leopard and got him fast to the tree. Then the leopard said Tighten the rope but instead of playing the game in accordance with the rules he had laid down the tortoise ran faster and faster with the rope round the leopard taking great care however to keep out of reach of the leopards claws and very soon had the leopard so securely fastened that it was quite impossible for him to free himself.All this time the leopard was calling out to the tortoise to let him go as he was tired of the game but the tortoise only laughed and sat down at the fireside and commenced his meal. When he had finished he packed up the remainder of the fish for his family and prepared to go but before he started he said to the leopardYou killed my mother and now you want to take my fish. It is not likely that I am going to the lake to get fish for you so I shall leave you here to starve.He then threw the remains of the pepper and salt into the leopards eyes and quietly went on his way leaving the leopard roaring with pain.All that day and throughout the night the leopard was calling out for some one to release him and vowing all sorts of vengeance on the tortoise but no one came as the people and animals of the forest do not like to hear the leopards voice.In the morning when the animals began to go about to get their food the leopard called out to every one he saw to come and untie him but they all refused as they knew that if they did so the leopard would most likely kill them at once and eat them. At last a bush rat came near and saw the leopard tied up to the tree and asked him what was the matter so the leopard told him that he had been playing a game of tight and loose with the tortoise and that he had tied him up and left him there to starve. The leopard then implored the bush rat to cut the ropes with his sharp teeth. The bush rat was very sorry for the leopard but at the same time he knew that if he let the leopard go he would most likely be killed and eaten so he hesitated and said that he did not quite see his way to cutting the ropes. But this bush rat being rather kindhearted and having had some experience of traps himself could sympathise with the leopard in his uncomfortable position. He therefore thought for a time and then hit upon a plan. He first started to dig a hole under the tree quite regardless of the leopards cries. When he had finished the hole he came out and cut one of the ropes and immediately ran into his hole and waited there to see what would happen but although the leopard struggled frantically he could not get loose as the tortoise had tied him up so fast. After a time when he saw that there was no danger the bush rat crept out again and very carefully bit through another rope and then retired to his hole as before. Again nothing happened and he began to feel more confidence so he bit several strands through one after the other until at last the leopard was free. The leopard who was ravenous with hunger instead of being grateful to the bush rat directly he was free made a dash at the bush rat with his big paw but just missed him as the bush rat had dived for his hole but he was not quite quick enough to escape altogether and the leopards sharp claws scored his back and left marks which he carried to his grave.Ever since then the bush rats have had white spots on their skins which represent the marks of the leopards claws.
Gouverneur Morris American minister to the court of Louis XVI was considerably enriched at the close of the reign of terror by plate jewels furniture paintings coaches and so on left in his charge by members of the French nobility that they might not be confiscated in the sack of the city by the sans culottes for so many of the aristocracy were killed and so many went into exile or disguised their names that it was impossible to find heirs or owners for these effects. Some of the people who found France a good country to be out of came to America where adventurers had found prosperity and refugees found peace so many times before. Marshal Ney and Bernadotte are alleged to have served in the American army during the Revolution and at Hogansburg New York the Reverend Eleazer Williams an Episcopal missionary who lies buried in the churchyard there was declared to be the missing son of Louis XVI. The question Have we a Bourbon among us was frequently canvassed but he avoided publicity and went quietly on with his pastoral work.All property left in Mr. Morriss hands that had not been claimed was removed to his mansion at Port Morris when he returned from his ministry and he gained in the esteem and envy of his neighbors when the extent of these riches was seen. Once at the wine he touched glasses with his wife and said that if she bore a male child that son should be heir to his wealth. Two relatives who sat at the table exchanged looks at this and cast a glance of no gentle regard on his lady. A year went by. The son was born but Gouverneur Morris was dead.It is the first night of the year 1817 the servants are asleep and the widow sits late before the fire her baby in her arms listening betimes to the wind in the chimney the beat of hail on the shutters the brawling of the Bronx and the clash of moving ice upon it yet thinking of her husband and the sinister look his promise had brought to the faces of his cousins when a tramp of horses is heard without and anon a summons at the door. The panels are beaten by loaded ridingwhips and a mans voice cries Anne Morris fetch us our cousins will or well break into the house and take it. The woman clutches the infant to her breast but makes no answer. Again the clatter of the whips but now a mist is gathering in the room and a strange enchantment comes over her for are not the lions breathing on the coat of arms above the door and are not the portraits stirring in their framesThey are indeed. There is a rustle of robes and clink of steel and one old warrior leaps down his armor sounding as he alights and striking thrice his sword and shield together he calls on Gouverneur Morris to come forth. Somebody moves in the room where Morris died there is a measured footfall in the corridor with the clank of a scabbard keeping time the door is opened and on the blast that enters the widow hears a cry then a double gallop passing swiftly into distance. As she gazes her husband appears apparelled as in life and with a smile he takes a candelabrum from the mantel and beckoning her to follow moves from room to room. Then for the first time the widow knows to what wealth her baby has been born for the ghost discloses secret drawers in escritoires where money title deeds and gems are hidden turns pictures and wainscots on unsuspected hinges revealing shelves heaped with fabrics plate and lace then returning to the fireside he stoops as if to kiss his wife and boy but a bell strikes the first hour of morning and he vanishes into his portrait on the wall.
There was once a horrible Vampire who took the form of a handsome young man and went to the house of an old woman who had three daughters and pretended he wanted to marry the oldest.I live far from here the Vampire said. I own my own farm and am welltodo and in marrying me your daughter would get a desirable husband. Indeed I am so well off that I dont have to ask any dowry.Now the old woman was so poor that she couldnt have given a penny of dowry. That was the only reason why all three of her daughters hadnt long ago been married to youths of their own village. So when the stranger said he would require no dowry the old woman whispered to her oldest daughterHe seems to be all right. Perhaps you had better take him.The poor girl accepted her mothers advice and that afternoon started off with the Vampire who said he would lead her home and marry her.They walked a great distance and as evening came on they reached a wild ghostly spot which frightened the girl half to death.This way my dear the Vampire said pushing her into an opening in the earth. We take this underground passage and soon well be home.The passage led to a sort of cave which really was the Vampires home.What an awful place the poor girl cried in terror. Let me outLet you out indeed the Vampire sneered taking his own horrible shape and laughing cruelly. Here you are and here you stay and if you dont do everything I tell you Ill soon finish you Here now drink this.He offered the poor girl a pitcher and when she saw what was in it she nearly fainted with horror.No she cried. I wont I wontIf you dont drink this the Vampire said darkly then Ill drink youAnd with that he killed her with no more feeling than if she were a fly.Then in a short time he went back to the old woman and saidDear mother my poor wife is ill and she begs that you send her your second daughter to nurse her. She asks for her sister night and day and I fear she will die unless she sees her.When the poor old mother heard this she begged the second daughter to go at once with the young man and nurse her sick sister.Well the same thing happened to the second sister and in no time at all the Vampire had killed her too to satisfy his awful thirst.Then he returned again to the old mother and this time he pretended that both sisters were sick and were trying for the third sister to come and nurse them. So the poor old woman sent her Youngest Daughter away with the Vampire.The Youngest Sister when she found out the truth about the horrid Vampire didnt sit down and weep helplessly as the others had done and wait for the Vampire to kill her but she prayed Gods help and then tried to find some way of escape.There were doors in the cave which the Vampire told her were doors to closets she must not enter. When the Vampire was out she opened these doors and found that they all led into long underground passages.This is my one chance to get back to earth the girl thought and commending her undertaking to God she fled down one of the passages.You may be sure the Vampire when he came back and found her gone fell into a great rage. He went running wildly up and down the various passages and lost so much time searching the wrong passages that the girl was able to make good her escape and reach the upper world in safety.She came out in a wood with no sign of human habitation anywhere in sight.What shall I do now she thought. If I stay here alone and unprotected some wild beast or evil creature may get me.So she knelt down and prayed God to give her a chest that she could lock from the inside with one of her own golden hairs so securely that no one could force it open. God heard her prayer and presently behind some bushes she found just such a chest. When it grew dark and she was ready to go to bed she crept into the chest locked it with a hair and slept peacefully knowing that nothing could harm her.So she lived in the wood some time eating berries and fruits and sleeping safely in the chest.Now it so happened that the Kings son one morning went hunting in this very wood and caught a glimpse of the girl as she was gathering berries. He thought he had never seen such a beautiful creature and in stantly he fell in love with her. But when he reached the clump of bushes where he had seen her she was gone. He called his huntsmen together and told them to search everywhere. They hunted for hours and all they could find was a chest. They tried to open the chest to see what was in it but couldnt.Waste no more time over it the Prince said at last. Carry it home to the palace as it is and have it placed in my chamber.The huntsmen did this and a few hours later when the girl peeped out of her chest she found herself alone in the Princes chamber. His supper was standing on a table in readiness for his coming. The girl ate the supper and was safely back in her chest before he arrived. When he did come the Prince was amazed to see empty plates and called the servants to know who had eaten his supper. The servants were as much surprised as the Prince and declared that no one had entered the chamber.The same thing happened the next day and the following day the Prince had one of his servants hide behind the curtains and watch to find out if possible how the food disappeared.The story the servant had to tell of what he saw was so thrilling that the Prince could scarcely wait for the next day when he himself hid behind the curtains and watched.The serving people put the food on the table and retired and presently the lid of the chest opened and the Prince saw the beautiful maiden of the wood step out. When she sat down at the table the Prince slipped up behind her and caught her in his arms.You lovely creature he said Im not going to let you escape me againAt first the girl was greatly frightened but the Prince reassured her telling her that he loved her dearly and only wanted to make her his wife.He led her at once to the King his father and the girl was so modest and lovely that the King soon agreed to the marriage.Everybody in court was delightedeverybody that is but the Chamberlain who had had hopes of marrying his own daughter to the Prince. His daughter was an ugly illtempered girl and the Prince had never even looked at her. The Chamberlain was sure however that with a little more time he could arrange the match to his liking. So the appearance of this beautiful girl who came from Heaven knows where threw him into a fearful rage and he decided to do away with her at any cost. Now he had in his employ a great burly Blackamoor. He called this fellow to him and he told him that he must kidnap the girl at once and kill her. The Blackamoor who was accustomed to do such deeds for the Chamberlain nodded and said he would.So when the palace was quiet that night he stole to the bedchamber where the girl was lying asleep threw a great robe over her head to stifle her cries and carried her off. She fainted away from fright and the Blackamoor thinking her dead tossed her into a field of nettles in the outskirts of the town.Now as you can imagine in the morning there was a great uproar in the palace when it was discovered that the Princes beautiful bridetobe had disappeared. The Prince was utterly griefstricken and refused to eat. The King and all the ladies of the court tried their best to comfort him but he turned away from them declaring he would die if his bride were not restored to him.The rascally Chamberlain put his handkerchief to his eyes and pretended to weep he was so affected by the sight of the Princes grief.My dear boy he said I would that I could find this maiden for you It breaks my heart to see you sad and unhappy But Im sorry to tell you that I hear she was a Vila and not a human maiden at all. You know how mysteriously she came and now shes gone just as mysteriously. So put the thought of her out of your mind and Im sure youll soon find a human maiden who is worthy of your love. Come here my daughter and tell the Prince how sorry you are that he is in grief.But the sight of the Chamberlains ugly daughter only made the Prince long the more for the beautiful girl who was gone.She meantime had found refuge in the hut of an old woman who had heard her groan in the early dawn when she lay among the nettles and had taken compassion on her.You may stay with me until youre well the old woman said.The girl was young and healthy and in a day or two had recovered the ill treatment she had suffered at the hands of the Blackamoor.Wont you let me live with you awhile granny she said to the old woman. Ill cook and scrub and work and you wont have to regret the little I eat.Can you cook Because if you can perhaps you know a dish that would tempt the appetite of our poor young Prince the old woman said. You know the poor boy has had a terrible disappointment in love and he refuses to eat. The heralds were out this morning proclaiming that the King would richly reward any one who could prepare a dish that would tempt the Princes appetite.Granny the girl said I know a wonderful way to prepare beans Let me cook a dish of beans and do you carry them to the palace.So the girl cooked the beans and placed them prettily in a dish and on one side of the dish she put a tiny little ringlet of her own golden hair.If he sees the hair she thought to herself hell know the beans are from me.And thats exactly what happened. To please his father the Prince had consented to look at every dish as it came. He had already looked at hundreds of them before the old woman arrived and turned away from them all. Then the old woman came. As she passed before the Prince she lifted the cover of the dish held it towards him and curtsied. The Prince was just about to turn away when he saw the tiny ringlet of hair.Oh he said. Wait a minute Those beans look goodTo the Kings delight he took the dish out of the old womans hand examined it carefully and when no one was looking slipped the ringlet into his pocket. Then he ate the beansevery last one of themThe King gave the old woman some golden ducats and begged her to prepare another dish for the Prince on the morrow.So the next day the girl again sent a tiny ringlet of her hair on the side of the plate and again the Prince after scorning all the other food offered him took the old womans dish and ate it clean.On the third day the Prince engaged the old woman in conversation.Where do you live grannyIn a little tumbledown house beside the nettles she told him.Do you live aloneJust now the old woman said I have a dear girl living with me. I found her one morning lying in the nettles where some ruffians had left her for dead. Shes a good girl and she scrubs and bakes and cooks for me and lets me rest my poor old bones.Now the Prince knew what he wanted to know.Granny he said tomorrows Sunday. Now I want you to stay home in the afternoon because Im coming to see you.In great excitement the old woman hurried home and told the girl that the Prince was coming to see them on Sunday afternoon.He mustnt see me the girl said. Ill hide in the bread trough under a cloth and if he goes looking for me you tell him that Ive gone out.Foolish child the old woman said. Why should you hide from a handsome young man like the PrinceBut the girl insisted and at last when Sunday afternoon came the old woman was forced to let her lie down in the bread trough and cover her with a cloth.The Prince arrived and when he found the old woman there alone he was mightily disappointed.Wheres that girl who lives with you he asked.Shes gone out the old woman said.Then I think Ill wait till she comes back.This made the old woman feel nervous.But my Prince I dont know when shes coming back.Just then the Prince thought he saw something move in the bread trough.Whats that lumpy thing in the bread trough grannyThat Oh thats just dough thats rising my Prince. Im baking today.Then make me a loaf granny. Ill wait for it until it rises and until you bake it. Then Ill eat it hot out of the oven.What was the old woman to say to that She fussed and fidgeted and thought again what a foolish young girl that was to be hiding in the bread trough when there was a handsome young Prince in the room.I dont know why that dough doesnt rise she remarked at last.Perhaps theres something the matter with it the Prince said.Before the old woman could stop him he jumped up tossed the cloth aside and there was his lovely brideWhy are you hiding from me he asked as he lifted her up and kissed her tenderly.Because I knew if you really loved me you would find me she said.Now that I have found you the Prince declared I shall never let you leave me again.Then the girl told the Prince about the wicked Chamberlain and the Blackamoor and it was all she and the old woman could do to keep the Prince from drawing his sword and rushing out instantly to kill both of them.The old woman begged the Prince to take the girl secretly to the King and have the King hear her story and then let him pass judgment on the Chamberlain according to the laws of the land. At last the Prince agreed to this.So they covered the girls head with a veil and took her to the King. When the King heard her story he called the court together at once and told them the outrage that had been committed against his sons promised bride. He commanded that the murderous Blackamoor be executed the next day and he decreed that the Chamberlain and his wicked daughter be stripped of their lands and riches and sent into exile.Let us hope that exile taught them the evil of their ways and made them repent.As for the girl she married the Prince and they lived together in great happiness. And she deserved to be happy too for she was a brave girl and a good girl and God loves people who are brave and good and blesses them.
On one side of the Island there lived a great shark Kaialeale he was named he was the King of the Sharks of that place and he had ten shaks under him. He lived near a cave that was filled with lobsters. But no one dared to dive down and go into that cave and take lobsters out of it on account of Kaialeale and the ten sharks he had under him they stayed around the cave night and day and if a diver ventured near they would bite him and devour him.There was a boy named Punia whose father had been killed by the sharks. Now after his father had been killed there was no one to catch fish for Pu nia and his mother they had sweet potatoes to eat but they never had any fish to eat with them. Often Punia heard his mother say that she wished she had a fish or lobster to eat with the sweet potatoes. He made up his mind that they should have lobsters.He came above the cave where the lobsters were. Looking down he saw the sharks  Kaialeale and his ten sharks they were all asleep. While he was watching them they wakened up. Punia pretended that he did not know that the sharks had wakened. He spoke loudly so that they would hear him and he said Here am I Punia  and I am going into the cave to get lobsters for myself and my mother. That great shark  Kai aleale is asleep now and I can dive to the point over there and then go into the cave I will take two lobsters in my hands and my mother and I will have something to eat with our sweet potatoes.  So Punia said speaking loudly and pretending that he thought the sharks were still asleep .Said Kaialeale speaking softly to the other sharks Let us rush to the place where Punia dives and let us devour him as we devoured his father.  But Punia was a very cunning boy and not at all the sort that could be caught by the stupid sharks. He had a stone upon his hand while he was speaking and he flung it towards the point that he said he was going to dive to. Just as soon as the stone struck the water the sharks made a rush to the place leaving the cave of the lobsters unguarded. Then Punia dived. He went into the cave took two lobsters in his hands and came up on the place that he had spoken from before.He shouted down to the sharks Here is Punia and he has come back safely. He has two lobsters and he and his mother have something to live on. It was the first shark the second shark the third shark the fourth shark the fifth shark the sixth shark the seventh shark the eighth shark the ninth shark the tenth shark  it was the tenth shark the one with the thin tail that showed Punia what to do. When the King of the Sharks Kai aleale heard this from Punia he ordered all the sharks to come together and stay in a row. He counted them and there were ten of them and the tenth one had a thin tail. So it was you Thin Tail  he said that told the boy Punia what to do. You shall die. Then according to the orders of Kaialeale the thin tailed shark was killed. Punia called out to them You have killed one of your own kind.  With the two lobsters in his hands he went back to his mothers.Punia and his mother now had something to eat with their sweet potatoes. And when the lobsters were all eaten Punia went back to the place above the cave. He called out the same as he had done the first time I can dive to the place over there and then slip into the cave for the sharks are all asleep I can get two lobsters for myself and my mother so that well have something to eat with our sweet potatoes.  Then he threw down a stone and made ready to dive to another point.When the stone struck the water the sharks rushed over leaving the cave unguarded. Then Punia dived down and went into the cave. He took two lobsters in his hands and got back to the top of the water  and when he got to the place that he had spoken from before he shouted down to the sharks It was the first shark the second shark the third shark the fourth shark  the fifth shark the sixth shark the seventh shark the eighth shark the ninth shark  it was the ninth shark the one with the big stomach that told Punia what to do. Then the King of the Sharks Kai aleale  or dered the sharks to get into a line. He counted them  and he found that the ninth shark had a big stomach. So it was you that told Punia what to do  he said and he ordered the bigstomached shark to be killed. After that Punia went home with his two lobsters and he and his mother had something to eat with their sweet potatoes.Punia continued to do this. He would deceive the sharks by throwing a stone to the place that he said he was going to dive to when he got the sharks away from the cave he would dive down slip in and take two lobsters in his hands. And always when he got to the top of the water he would name a shark. The first shark the second shark the third shark the shark with the little eye the shark with the grey spot on him  told Punia what to do he would say and each time he would get one of the sharks killed. He kept on doing this until only one of the sharks was left this one was Kaialeale the King of the Sharks .After that Punia went into the forest  he hewed out two hard pieces of wood each about a yard long then he took sticks for lighting a fire  the auli ma to rub with and the aunaki to rub on he got charcoal to burn as a fire and he got food. He put all into a bag  and he carried the bag down to the beach. He came above the cave that Kaialeale was watching and he said speaking in a loud voice If I dive now and if Kaialeale bites me my blood will come to the top of the water and my mother will see the blood and will bring me back to life again. But if I dive down and Kaialeale takes me into his mouth whole I shall die and never come back to life again. Kaialeale was listening of course. He said to himself No I will not bite you you cunning boy I will take you into my mouth and swallow you whole and then you will never come back to life again. I shall open my mouth wide enough to take you in. Yes indeed this time I will get you. Punia dived holding his bag. Kaialeale opened his mouth wide and got Pu  nia into it. But as soon as the boy got within he opened his bag and took out the two pieces of wood which he had hewn out in the forest. He put them between the jaws of the shark so that Kaialeale was not able to close his jaws. With his mouth held open Kaialeale went dashing through the water.Punia was now inside the big shark he took the firesticks out of his bag and rubbed them together making a fire. He kindled the charcoal that he had brought and he cooked his food at the fire that he had made. With the fire in his insides the shark could not keep still he went dashing here and there through the ocean.At last the shark came near the Island of Hawaii again. If he brings me near the breakers I am saved  said Punia  speaking aloud  but if he takes me to the sand near where the grass grows I shall die I cannot be saved.  Kai aleale when he heard Punia say this said to himself I will not take him near the breakers I will take him where the dry sand is near the grass.  Saying this he dashed in from the ocean and up to where the shrubs grew on the shore. No shark had ever gone there before and when Kai aleale got there he could not get back again.Then Punia came out of the shark. He shouted out  Kaialeale Kaiale  ale the King of the Sharks has come to visit us.  And the people hearing about their enemy Kaialeale came down to the shore with their spears and their knives and killed him. And that was the end of the ugly and wicked King of the Sharks.Every day after that Punia was able to go down into the cave and get lobsters for himself and his mother. And all the people rejoiced when they knew that the eleven sharks that guarded the cave had been got rid of by the boy Punia.
Once upon a time the King of GreenBank had three daughters who were perfect jewels with whom three sons of the King of FairMeadow were desperately in love. But these Princes having been changed into animals by the spell of a fairy the King of GreenBank disdained to give them his daughters to wife. Whereupon the first who was a beautiful Falcon called together all the birds to a council and there came the chaffinches tomtits woodpeckers flycatchers jays blackbirds cuckoos thrushes and every other kind of bird. And when they were all assembled at his summons he ordered them to destroy all the blossoms on the trees of GreenBank so that not a flower or leaf should remain. The second Prince who was a Stag summoning all the goats rabbits hares hedgehogs and other animals of that country laid waste all the cornfields so that there was not a single blade of grass or corn left. The third Prince who was a Dolphin consulting together with a hundred monsters of the sea made such a tempest arise upon the coast that not a boat escaped.Now the King saw that matters were going from bad to worse and that he could not remedy the mischief which these three wild lovers were causing so he resolved to get out of his trouble and made up his mind to give them his daughters to wife and thereupon without wanting either feasts or songs they carried their brides off and out of the kingdom.On parting from her daughters Granzolla the Queen gave each of them a ring one exactly like the other telling them that if they happened to be separated and after a while to meet again or to see any of their kinsfolk they would recognise one another by means of these rings. So taking their leave they departed. And the Falcon carried Fabiella who was the eldest of the sisters to the top of a mountain which was so high that passing the confines of the clouds it reached with a dry head to a region where it never rains and there leading her to a most beautiful palace she lived like a Queen.The Stag carried Vasta the second sister into a wood which was so thick that the Shades when summoned by the Night could not find their way out to escort her. There he placed her as befitted her rank in a wonderfully splendid house with a garden.The Dolphin swam with Rita the third sister on his back into the middle of the sea where upon a large rock he showed her a mansion in which three crowned Kings might live.Meanwhile Granzolla gave birth to a fine little boy whom they named Tittone. And when he was fifteen years old hearing his mother lamenting continually that she never heard any tidings of her three daughters who were married to three animals he took it into his head to travel through the world until he should obtain some news of them. So after begging and entreating his father and mother for a long time they granted him permission bidding him take for his journey attendants and everything needful and befitting a Prince and the Queen also gave him another ring similar to those she had given to her daughters.Tittone went his way and left no corner of Italy not a nook of France nor any part of Spain unsearched. Then he passed through England and traversed Slavonia and visited Poland and in short travelled both east and west. At length leaving all his servants some at the taverns and some at the hospitals he set out without a farthing in his pocket and came to the top of the mountain where dwelt the Falcon and Fabiella. And as he stood there beside himself with amazement contemplating the beauty of the palacethe cornerstones of which were of porphyry the walls of alabaster the windows of gold and the tiles of silverhis sister observed him and ordering him to be called she demanded who he was whence he came and what chance had brought him to that country. When Tittone told her his country his father and mother and his name Fabiella knew him to be her brother and the more when she compared the ring upon his finger with that which her mother had given her and embracing him with great joy she concealed him fearing that her husband would be angry when he returned home.As soon as the Falcon came home Fabiella began to tell him that a great longing had come over her to see her parents. And the Falcon answered Let the wish pass wife for that cannot be unless the humour takes me.Let us at least said Fabiella send to fetch one of my kinsfolk to keep my company.And pray who will come so far to see you replied the Falcon.Nay but if any one should come added Fabiella would you be displeasedWhy should I be displeased said the Falcon it would be enough that he were one of your kinsfolk to make me take him to my heart.When Fabiella heard this she took courage and calling to her brother to come forth she presented him to the Falcon who exclaimed Five and five are ten love passes through the glove and water through the boot. A hearty welcome to you you are master in this house command and do just as you like. Then he gave orders that Tittone should be served and treated with the same honour as himself.Now when Tittone had stayed a fortnight on the mountain it came into his head to go forth and seek his other sisters. So taking leave of Fabiella and his brotherinlaw the Falcon gave him one of his feathers saying Take this and prize it my dear Tittone for you may one day be in trouble and you will then esteem it a treasure. Enoughtake good care of it and if ever you meet with any mishap throw it on the ground and say Come hither come hither and you shall have cause to thank me.Tittone wrapped the feather up in a sheet of paper and putting it in his pocket after a thousand ceremonies departed. And travelling on and on a very long way he arrived at last at the wood where the Stag lived with Vasta and going halfdead with hunger into the garden to pluck some fruit his sister saw him and recognised him in the same manner as Fabiella had done. Then she presented Tittone to her husband who received him with the greatest friendship and treated him truly like a Prince.At the end of a fortnight when Tittone wished to depart and go in search of his other sister the Stag gave him one of his hairs repeating the same words as the Falcon had spoken about the feather. And setting out on his way with a bagful of crownpieces which the Falcon had given him and as many more which the Stag gave him he walked on and on until he came to the end of the earth where being stopped by the sea and unable to walk any further he took ship intending to seek through all the islands for tidings of his sister. So setting sail he went about and about until at length he was carried to an island where lived the Dolphin with Rita. And no sooner had he landed than his sister saw and recognised him in the same manner as the others had done and he was received by her husband with all possible affection.Now after a while Tittone wished to set out again to go and visit his father and mother whom he had not seen for so long a time. So the Dolphin gave him one of his scales telling him the same as the others had and Tittone mounting a horse set out on his travels. But he had hardly proceeded half a mile from the seashore when entering a woodthe abode of Fear and the Shades where a continual fair of darkness and terror was kept uphe found a great tower in the middle of a lake whose waters were kissing the feet of the trees and entreating them not to let the Sun witness their pranks. At a window in the tower Tittone saw a most beautiful maiden sitting at the feet of a hideous dragon who was asleep. When the damsel saw Tittone she said in a low and piteous voice O noble youth sent perchance by heaven to comfort me in my miseries in this place where the face of a Christian is never seen release me from the power of this tyrannical serpent who has carried me off from my father the King of BrightValley and shut me up in this frightful tower where I must die a miserable death.Alas my beauteous lady replied Tittone what can I do to serve thee Who can pass this lake Who can climb this tower Who can approach yon horrid dragon that carries terror in his look sows fear and causes dismay to spring up But softly wait a minute and well find a way with anothers help to drive this serpent away. Step by stepthe more haste the worse speed we shall soon see whether tis egg or wind. And so saying he threw the feather the hair and the scale which his brothersinlaw had given him on the ground exclaiming Come hither come hither And falling on the earth like drops of summer rain which makes the frogs spring up suddenly there appeared the Falcon the Stag and the Dolphin who cried out all together Behold us here what are your commandsWhen Tittone saw this he said with great joy I wish for nothing but to release this poor damsel from the claws of yon dragon to take her away from this tower to lay it all in ruins and to carry this beautiful lady home with me as my wife.Hush answered the Falcon for the bean springs up where you least expect it. Well soon make him dance upon a sixpence and take good care that he shall have little ground enough.Let us lose no time said the Stag troubles and macaroni are swallowed hot.So the Falcon summoned a large flock of griffins who flying to the window of the tower carried off the damsel bearing her over the lake to where Tittone was standing with his three brothersinlaw and if from afar she appeared a moon believe me when near she looked truly like a sun she was so beautiful.Whilst Tittone was embracing her and telling her how he loved her the dragon awoke and rushing out of the window he came swimming across the lake to devour Tittone. But the Stag instantly called up a squadron of lions tigers panthers bears and wildcats who falling upon the dragon tore him in pieces with their claws. Then Tittone wishing to depart the Dolphin said I likewise desire to do something to serve you. And in order that no trace should remain of the frightful and accursed place he made the sea rise so high that overflowing its bounds it attacked the tower furiously and overthrew it to its foundations.When Tittone saw these things he thanked the animals in the best manner he could telling the damsel at the same time that she ought to do so too as it was by their aid she had escaped from peril. But the animals answered Nay we ought rather to thank this beauteous lady since she is the means of restoring us to our proper shapes for a spell was laid upon us at our birth caused by our mothers having offended a fairy and we were compelled to remain in the form of animals until we should have freed the daughter of a King from some great trouble. And now behold the time is arrived which we have longed for the fruit is ripe and we already feel new spirit in our breasts new blood in our veins. So saying they were changed into three handsome youths and one after another they embraced their brotherinlaw and shook hands with the lady who was in an ecstasy of joy.When Tittone saw this he was on the point of fainting away and heaving a deep sigh he said O Heavens why have not my mother and father a share in this happiness They would be out of their wits with joy were they to see such graceful and handsome sonsinlaw before their eyes.Nay answered the Princes tis not yet night the shame at seeing ourselves so transformed obliged us to flee from the sight of men but now that thank Heaven we can appear in the world again we will all go and live with our wives under one roof and spend our lives merrily. Let us therefore set out instantly and before the Sun tomorrow morning unpacks the bales of his rays at the customhouse of the East our wives shall be with you.So saying in order that they might not have to go on footfor there was only an old brokendown mare which Tittone had broughtthe brothers caused a most beautiful coach to appear drawn by six lions in which they all five seated themselves and having travelled the whole day they came in the evening to a tavern where whilst the supper was being prepared they passed the time in reading all the proofs of mens ignorance which were scribbled upon the walls. At length when all had eaten their fill and retired to rest the three youths feigning to go to bed went out and walked about the whole night long till in the morning when the Stars like bashful maidens retire from the gaze of the Sun they found themselves in the same inn with their wives whereupon there was a great embracing and a joy beyond the beyonds. Then they all eight seated themselves in the same coach and after a long journey arrived at GreenBank where they were received with incredible affection by the King and Queen who had not only regained the capital of four children whom they had considered lost but likewise the interest of three sonsinlaw and a daughterinlaw who were verily four columns of the Temple of Beauty. And when the news of the adventures of their children was brought to the Kings of FairMeadow and BrightValley they both came to the feasts which were made adding the rich ingredient of joy to the porridge of their satisfaction and receiving a full recompense for all their past misfortunes forOne hour of joy dispels the caresAnd sufferings of a thousand years.
Among the natives of Block Island was a man named Lee. Born in the last century among fishermen and wreckers he has naturally taken to the sea for a livelihood and never having known the influences of education and refinement he is rude and imperious in manner. His ship lies in a Spanish port fitting for sea but not with freight for tired of peaceful trading Lee is equipping his vessel as a privateer. A Spanish lady who has just been bereaved of her husband comes to him to ask a passage to America for she has no suspicion of his intent. Her jewels and wellfilled purse arouse Lees cupidity and with pretended sympathy he accedes to her request even going so far as to allow Senoras favorite horse to be brought aboard.Hardly is the ship in deep water before the ladys servants are stabbed in their sleep and Lee smashes in the door of her cabin. Realizing his purpose and preferring to sacrifice life to honor she eludes him climbs the rail and leaps into the sea while the ship ploughs on. As a poor revenge for being thus balked of his prey the pirate has the beautiful white horse flung overboard the animal shrilling a neigh that seems to reach to the horizon and is like nothing ever heard before. But these things he affects to forget in dice and drinking. In a dispute over a division of plunder Lee stabs one of his men and tosses him overboard. Soon the rovers come to Block Island where under cover of night they carry ashore their stealings to hide them in pits and caves reserving enough gold to buy a welcome from the wreckers and here they live for a year gaming and carousing. Their ship has been reported as a pirate and to baffle search it is set adrift.One night a ruddy star is seen on the seaverge and the ruffians leave their revelling to look at it for it is growing into sight fast. It speeds toward them and they can now see that it is a shiptheir shipwrapped in flames. It stops off shore and out of the ocean at its prow emerges something white that they say at first is a wavecrest rolling upon the sands but it does not dissolve as breakers do it rushes on it scales the bluff it is a milkwhite horse that gallops to the men who inly wonder if this is an alcoholic vision and glares at Lee. A spell seems to be laid on him and unable to resist it the buccaneer mounts the animal. It rushes away snorting and plunging to the highest bluff whence Lee beholds in the light of the burning ship the bodies of all who have been done to death by him staring into his eyes through the reddening waves.At dawn the horse sinks under him and he stands there alone. From that hour even his companions desert him. They fear to share his curse. He wanders about the island a broken miserable man unwilling to live afraid to die refused shelter and friendship and unable to reach the mainland for no boat will give him passage. After a year of this existence the ship returns the spectre horse rises from the deep and claims Lee again for a rider. He mounts the animal speeds away to the cliff but does not pause at the brink this time with a sickening jump and fall he goes into the sea. Spurning the wavetops in his flight he makes a circuit of the burning ship and in the hellish light that fills the air and penetrates to the ocean bottom the pirate sees again his victims looking up with smiles and arms spread to embrace him.There is a cry of terror as the steed stops short then a gurgle and horse and rider have disappeared. The fire ship vanishes and the night is dark.
There was once a poor man whose wife died leaving him a daughter. The little girls name was Lenka. She was a good little girl cheerful and obedient and very industrious and she did all she could to make her father comfortable.After some time the man married again. His second wife also had a little girl just Lenkas age. Her name was Dorla. Dorla was a lazy illnatured child always quarreling and bickering. Yet her mother thought Dorla was perfect and she was always praising her to her husband.See what a good child my Dorla is she would say to him. She works and spins and never says a cross word. Very different from your goodfornothing Lenka who always breaks everything she touches and does nothing in return for all the good food she eatsShe never stopped nagging and scolding her poor stepchild and complaining about her to her husband. Lenka was patient and went on quietly doing what was right and she was always polite to her stepmother and kind to her illnatured stepsister.She and Dorla used to go to spinning bees together. Dorla would play and waste her time and hardly fill one spindle. Lenka always worked industriously and usually filled two or three spools. Yet when the two girls got home the mother always took Dorlas halffilled spindle and said to the father See what beautiful yarn my Dorla spins She would hide Lenkas spools and say Your Lenka did nothing but play and waste her timeAnd before other people she talked the same way pretending Dorla did everything that she didnt do and saying that good industrious Lenka was lazy and goodfornothing.One night when the two girls were walking home together from a spinning bee they came to a ditch in the road. Dorla jumped quickly across and then reached back her hand and saidMy dear sister let me hold your spindle. You may fall and hurt yourself.Poor Lenka suspecting nothing unkind handed Dorla her full spindle. Dorla took it and ran home and then boasted to her mother and her stepfather how much she had spun.Lenka she said has no yarn at all. She did nothing but play and waste her time.You see said the woman to her husband. This is what Im always telling you but you never believe me. That Lenka of yours is a lazy goodfornothing girl who expects me and my poor daughter to do all the work. Im not going to stand her in the house any longer. Tomorrow morning out she goes to make her own way in the world. Then perhaps shell understand what a good home shes had with meThe poor man tried to defend Lenka but his wife would hear nothing. Lenka must go and that was all there was to it.Early the next morning while it was still dark the woman started Lenka off. She gave her a sack that she said was full of good meal and smoked meat and bread. But instead of meal she put in ashes instead of smoked meat straw and instead of bread stones.Here is meal and smoked meat and bread for your journey she said. You will be a long time finding any one who will be as good to you as I have been Now be off with you and never let me see you again Let your father put you out in service if he canThe poor man put his ax on his shoulder and started off with Lenka. He had no place to take her and he hardly knew what to do. He led her off into the mountains where he built her a little tworoom hut. He was ashamed to tell her that he was going to leave her alone so he said to herYou stay here my dear child while I go farther into the forest and cut you some firewood.But instead of cutting her firewood he hung his mallet on a beech tree and whenever the wind blew the mallet made a knocking sound. All afternoon poor little Lenka hearing the knockknock of the mallet thought to herself There is my dear father chopping wood for meWhen evening came and he hadnt returned Lenka went out to find him but all she could find was the mallet going knockknock on the tree. Then the poor girl realized that her father had deceived her but she forgave him for she knew that it was her stepmothers fault.She went back to the little hut to get her supper but when she opened the sack her stepmother had given her instead of meal and smoked meat and bread she found only ashes and straw and stones. Then indeed did Lenka feel deserted and sitting down she cried with loneliness and hunger.While she was crying an old beggar with a long beard came into the hut.God grant you happiness my child he said.May He grant you the same old father Lenka said standing up and bowing politely.Thank you my child thank you. And now will you be so kind as to wash my face and give me a bite of supperIndeed old father Id gladly wash your face and give you food but theres no water here and nothing to carry it in. And as for food my stepmother filled the sack with ashes straw and stones.Thats nothing my child. Just go behind the hut and you will find a spring.Lenka went and there sure enough was a clear bubbling spring and on the ground beside it a bucket. She filled the bucket and carried it back to the hut.As she entered the door she could hardly believe her eyes for on the wall she saw a row of shining plates big plates and little plates and cups and everything else that ought to be in a kitchen. The old beggar had started a fire so Lenka at once put on water to boil.Look in the sack the beggar said.Lenka untied the sack again and here it was full of fine meal and bread and smoked meatSo now Lenka lost no time in preparing a good supper. Then she washed the old beggars face and hands and together they ate. After supper Lenka spread out her ragged clothes on the floor of the inner room and put the beggar in there for the night. She herself stretched out on the kitchen bench. It was a hard bed but Lenka made no complaint and presently she fell asleep.At midnight there was a knocking at the door and a voice called outA man am ISix inches highBut a long long beardHangs from my chin.Open the doorAnd let me inLenka jumped down and opened the door and there before her stood a tiny dwarf with a long beard. He was Long Beard who lived in the mountains and of whom Lenka had often heard stories.He came in dragging after him a heavy bag of golden ducats.I was that old beggar he said whose face you washed and with whom you shared your supper. These ducats are to reward you for your kindness. Now go into your bedroom and lie down comfortably.As he said this he vanished.Lenka went into her bedroom and there instead of her few rags on the floor was a fine feather bed and coverlets and a painted chest full of clothes. Lenka lay down on the feather bed and instantly fell asleep.On the third day her father came supposing by that time Lenka had either died of hunger or been devoured by wild beasts. At least he thought he would gather together her bones.But when he reached the hut he rubbed his eyes in surprise. Instead of the rough hut there was a pretty little cottage and instead of a handful of bones there was a happy girl singing away at her spinning.My daughter my daughter he cried. How are youVery well dear father. You couldnt have found a better place for me.She told him how happy she was and how pleasantly she passed the time spinning and singing and working. Then she took a tablecloth and filled it with golden ducats and gave it to him.So he went away very happy thanking God for the good fortune that had come to Lenka.As he neared home the old dog that lay at the door said to the stepmotherBowwow mistress here comes the master. Its chinkchink the money before him and chinkchink the money behind himNot so old dog the stepmother cried. Its rattlerattle bones before him and rattlerattle bones behind himNow when the man came into the cottage he said Wife give me a basket and let me empty this tablecloth.What she cried. Do you expect me to give you a basket for your daughters bonesBut he began to chink the golden ducats and then she got a basket fast enough.When she had all the ducats safely put away she saidIsnt it just like you to find a place like that for your Lenka But what have you ever done for my poor Dorla Tomorrow you will take her out into the world and find a good place for herSo she got ready for Dorla a fine new bed and stylish clothes and as much good food as she could carry. The next day the man took Dorla out into the mountains and built her a little hut of two rooms.Dorla sat in the hut and thought about the good supper she was going to cook for herself.In the evening the same old beggar came and said to herMay God grant you happiness my child. Wont you please wash my faceWash your face indeed cried Dorla in a rage. This is what Ill do to you And she took a stick and drove the old beggar away.Very well he muttered. Very well Very wellThen Dorla cooked herself a fine supper. After she had eaten every bite of it herself she lay down on the bed and went soundly to sleep.At midnight Long Beard knocked at the door and called outA man am ISix inches highBut a long long beardHangs from my chin.Open the doorAnd let me inThen Dorla was very frightened and she hid in the corner. Long Beard broke open the door and he caught Dorla and he shook her out of her skin. It served her right too for she was a wicked spiteful girl and she had never been kind to anybody in her life.Long Beard left her bones in a heap on the floor and he hung her skin on the nail at the back of the door. Then he put her grinning skull in the window.On the third day Dorlas mother gave her husband a brand new tablecloth and saidGo now and see how my Dorla is getting on. Here is a tablecloth for the ducats.So the man took the tablecloth and went to the mountains. As he came near the hut he saw something in the window that looked like grinning teeth. He said to himselfDorla must be very happy to be smiling at me from this distance.But when he reached the hut all he found of Dorla was a heap of bones on the floor the skin hanging on the nail behind the door and the skull grinning in the window.Without a word he gathered the bones into the tablecloth and started back.As he neared home the old dog saidBowwow mistress here comes the master and its rattlerattle before him and rattlerattle behind him.Not so old dog cried the woman. Its chinkchink before him and chinkchink behind himBut the old dog kept on barking and sayingNo no bowwow its rattlerattle before him and rattlerattle behind himIn a rage the woman took a stick and beat the dog.Then the man stepped into the cottage and at once his wife brought out a basket for the ducats. But when he shook out the tablecloth there was only the rattlerattle of bones.
Twardowski was by birth a nobleman. He desired to be wiser than other honest folks and to discover an elixir against death for of all things he feared to die. He had learnt in an old book the art of calling demons into his presence. He left Cracow in which city he was a doctor of medicine secretly at midnight and came to Podgorze where he began his magical arts to summon the demon from the deep. The evil spirit soon appeared. As was customary in those days the two entered into a covenant. The demon knelt on the ground and wrote out a bond which Twardowski signed with his own blood squeezed out of the third finger of his left hand. The chief condition of the covenant was this the demon should have no power over the body or soul of Twardowski unless he could catch him in Rome.By virtue of the bond executed between them Twardowski commanded the services of the demon and he ordered him to collect all the silver in Poland to bury it at Olkusz and to cover it well over with sand. The obedient servant did as he was bid. Hence the celebrated silver mines of Olkusz. Then Twardowski ordered the evil spirit to bring a great rock to Piaskowa Skala to set it on its sharpest point in the earth and there to leave it for ever. The obedient servant at once obeyed the command. The rock still stands as it was first set up and is called the Hawks Rock.In a word whatever Twardowski desired he could at once obtain. He could ride on a painted horse and fly in the air without wings. When he travelled he would seat himself on a cock and gallop on his way faster than on horseback. He would proceed in a boat on the river Vistula his sweetheart by his side against the tide without oar or sail. He could take a piece of glass in his hand and with it burn up whole villages although a hundred miles distant.Twardowski fell in love with a young lady and sought her in marriage. But she had a curious whim of keeping an insect confined in a bottle and said that the man who could guess what creature it was should be her husband. Twardowski disguised himself as a beggar and presented himself before the young lady. She held up the bottle at a distance and asked himWhat kind of creature is thisworm or snakeIt is a bee miss answered Twadrowski.He was right and he married the young lady. But they made a strange couple. Madame Twardowski sold all kinds of earthern ware in a mud hut on the marketplace at Cracow. Her husband would sometimes pass that way attired like a wealthy nobleman and he would then order his numerous servants to break his wifes wares into pieces. When the woman in her fury cursed him his servants and all about her Twardowski seated in his fine carriage enjoyed his frolic the more and would burst into loud laughter.After some time when Twardowski was sated with pleasure he went one day into the depths of a forest without his instruments of magic. As he there sat buried in thought the demon suddenly appeared to him and demanded that he should at once set out for Rome. The magician enraged at the demand drove the evil spirit from before him by a single word of a powerful incantation. But the fiend gnashing his teeth with fury pulled a large pinetree up by the roots and struck Twardowski with such violence on the legs that he broke one of them. Twardowski was lamed for life and from that hour was nicknamed and commonly known as Gameleg.At last the demon grew tired of waiting for the soul of Twardowski. He devised a strategem to entrap him. He assumed the shape of a gentlemans footman went to Twardowski who was then greatly renowned as a physician and begged him to come to his master who stood in great need of his help. Twardowski proceeded in all speed with the messenger to a neighbouring village not knowing that in this village was a tavern called Rome. No sooner had he entered this tavern than a large flock of crows and owls sat down on the roof and filled the air with dreadful croaks and screams. Twardowski saw at once how the matter stood. Trembling with fear he seized a newly baptised infant in his arms from the cradle in which it lay and began to nurse it.The demon soon made his appearance. Although finely attiredhe wore a threecornered cocked hat a dress coat long waistcoat tight breeches and shoes with buckleshe was recognised at once for his horns were visible above his hat and his cloven feet stuck out of his shoes. The demon was about to seize Twardowski when he perceived a difficultythe magician held in his arms a sinless infant over which the demon had no possible claim. But the fiend did not lose his wits. He approached Twardowski with the utmost composure and said to himYou are at least a gentleman remember Verbum nobile debet esse stabile.Twardowski saw that he could not escape so he laid the infant in the cradle and disappeared with his terrible companion up the chimney. The flock of crows and owls screamed with joy. But Twardowski although carried with great rapidity into the air did not lose his consciousness or presence of mind. He was borne up so high that villages appeared no bigger than gnats towns looked of the size of flies and Cracow itself like two spiders. He looked down upon the earth and sorrow filled his heart. There he had left all that was dear to him. When he had arrived at a height which neither the hawk nor the Carpathian eagle ever attained he made a tremendous effort and in a weak voice began to sing a hymn. It was a hymn to the Virgin Mary which he had composed when he was young and innocent. He knew nothing then of the Black Art and used to sing the hymn daily. Although he sang with all the strength he possessed his voice seemed lost in the air. But some shepherds who were tending their flocks on the mountain side just beneath him heard the hymn and looked up wondering into the sky to learn whence came those sacred words for his voice instead of ascending and being lost in the air descended to the earth that human souls might hear it. Twardowski sang the hymn to the end and found to his astonishment that his upward flight was arrested and that he remained suspended in the air in the same spot. His companion had disappeared. Then he heard a voice from a dark cloud which saidThus you will remain suspended in the air until the day of judgment.Where his upward course was arrested there he still remains. But his voice is no longer heard. Not many years ago old people who remembered his story would point out on bright nights a dark spot in the sky as the body of Twardowski awaiting the day of judgment.
There once lived a poor tailor who had a son called Aladdin a careless idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the father that he died yet in spite of his mothers tears and prayers Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day when he was playing in the streets as usual a stranger asked him his age and if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor.I am sir replied Aladdin but he died a long while ago.On this the stranger who was a famous African magician fell on his neck and kissed him saying I am your uncle and knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am coming.Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle.Indeed child she said your father had a brother but I always thought he was dead.However she prepared supper and bade Aladdin seek his uncle who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit bidding Aladdins mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before as he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin and asked him his trade at which the boy hung his head while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took him all over the city showing him the sights and brought him home at nightfall to his mother who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle which he divided between them. They then journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains. Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories and led him on in spite of himself.At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley.We will go no farther said the false uncle. I will show you something wonderful only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a fire.When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him at the same time saying some magical words. The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run away but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down.What have I done uncle he said piteously whereupon the magician said more kindly Fear nothing but obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours and no one else may touch it so you must do exactly as I tell you.At the word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears and grasped the ring as he was told saying the names of his father and grandfather. The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared.Go down said the magician at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk on till you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me.He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin bidding him prosper.Aladdin found everything as the magician had said gathered some fruit off the trees and having got the lamp arrived at the mouth of the cave. The magician cried out in a great hurryMake haste and give me the lamp. This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. The magician flew into a terrible passion and throwing some more powder on the fire he said something and the stone rolled back into its place.The magician left Persia for ever which plainly showed that he was no uncle of Aladdins but a cunning magician who had read in his magic books about a wonderful lamp which would make him the most powerful man in the world. Though he alone knew where to find it he could only receive it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for this purpose intending to get the lamp and kill him afterwards.For two days Aladdin remained in the dark crying and lamenting. At last he clasped his hands in prayer and in so doing rubbed the ring which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth sayingWhat would you do with me I am the Slave of the Ring and will obey you in all things.Aladdin fearlessly replied Deliver me from this place whereupon the earth opened and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home but fainted on the threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden which were in reality precious stones. He then asked for some food.Alas child she said I have nothing in the house but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it.Aladdin bade her keep her cotton for he would sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared and asked what she would have. She fainted away but Aladdin snatching the lamp said boldlyFetch me something to eatThe genie returned with a silver bowl twelve silver plates containing rich meats two silver cups and two bottles of wine. Aladdins mother when she came to herself saidFrom where comes this splendid feastAsk not but eat replied Aladdin.So they sat at breakfast till it was dinnertime and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it and have nothing to do with devils.No said Aladdin since chance has made us aware of its virtues we will use it and the ring likewise which I shall always wear on my finger. When they had eaten all the genie had brought Aladdin sold one of the silver plates and so on till none were left. He then had recourse to the genie who gave him another set of plates and thus they lived for many years.One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess his daughter went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face which was very difficult as she always wore a veil. He hid himself behind the door of the bath and peeped through a hole. The princess lifted her veil as she went in and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home so changed that his mother was frightened. He told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her and meant to ask her in marriage of her father. His mother on hearing this burst out laughing but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan and set out trusting in the lamp. The grandvizir and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan. He however took no notice of her. She went every day for a week and stood in the same place.When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to his vizir I see a certain woman in the audiencechamber every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next time that I may find out what she wants.Next day at a sign from the vizir she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her Rise good woman and tell me what you want.She hesitated so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir and bade her speak freely promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say. She then told him of her sons violent love for the princess.I prayed him to forget her she said but in vain he threatened to do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the hand of the princess. Now I pray you to forgive me alone and my son Aladdin.The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them.He was thunderstruck and turning to the vizir said What do you say Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such a priceThe vizir who wanted her for his own son begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted this and told Aladdins mother that though he consented to the marriage she must not appear before him again for three months.Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months but after two had elapsed his mother going into the city to buy oil found everyone rejoicing and asked what was going on.Do you not know was the answer that the son of the grandvizir is to marry the Sultans daughter tonightBreathless she ran and told Aladdin who was overwhelmed at first but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed it and the genie appeared saying What is thy willAladdin replied The Sultan as thou knowest has broken his promise to me and the vizirs son is to have the princess. My command is that tonight you bring hither the bride and bridegroom.Master I obey said the genie.Aladdin then went to his chamber where sure enough at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the vizirs son and the princess.Take this newly married man he said and put him outside in the cold and return at daybreak.Whereupon the genie took the vizirs son out of bed leaving Aladdin with the princess.Fear nothing Aladdin said to her you are my wife promised to me by your unjust father and no harm shall come to you.The princess was too frightened to speak and passed the most miserable night of her life while Aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom laid him in his place and transported the bed back to the palace.Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter goodmorning. The unhappy vizirs son jumped up and hid himself while the princess would not say a word and was very sorrowful.The Sultan sent her mother to her who said How comes it child that you will not speak to your father What has happenedThe princess sighed deeply and at last told her mother how during the night the bed had been carried into some strange house and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.The following night exactly the same thing happened and next morning on the princesss refusing to speak the Sultan threatened to cut off her head. She then confessed all bidding him ask the vizirs son if it were not so. The Sultan told the vizir to ask his son who owned the truth adding that dearly as he loved the princess he had rather die than go through another such fearful night and wished to be separated from her. His wish was granted and there was an end of feasting and rejoicing.When the three months were over Aladdin sent his mother to remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before and the Sultan who had forgotten Aladdin at once remembered him and sent for her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word and asked the vizirs advice who counselled him to set so high a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it.The Sultan then turned to Aladdins mother saying Good woman a Sultan must remember his promises and I will remember mine but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels carried by forty black slaves led by as many white ones splendidly dressed. Tell him that I await his answer. The mother of Aladdin bowed low and went home thinking all was lost.She gave Aladdin the message adding He may wait long enough for your answerNot so long mother as you think her son replied I would do a great deal more than that for the princess.He summoned the genie and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived and filled up the small house and garden.Aladdin made them set out to the palace two and two followed by his mother. They were so richly dressed with such splendid jewels in their girdles that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads.They entered the palace and after kneeling before the Sultan stood in a halfcircle round the throne with their arms crossed while Aladdins mother presented them to the Sultan.He hesitated no longer but said Good woman return and tell your son that I wait for him with open arms.She lost no time in telling Aladdin bidding him make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie.I want a scented bath he said richly embroidered clothing a horse surpassing the Sultans and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides this six slaves beautifully dressed to wait on my mother and lastly ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those who had played with him in his childhood did not known him for he had grown so handsome.When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne embraced him and led him into a hall where a feast was spread intending to marry him to the princess that very day.But Aladdin refused saying I must build a palace fit for her and took his leave.Once home he said to the genie Build me a palace of the finest marble set with jasper agate and other precious stones. In the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome its four walls of large amounts of gold and silver each side having six windows whose lattices all except one which is to be left unfinished must be set with diamonds and rubies. There must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves go and see about itThe palace was finished by next day and the genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out even to the laying of a velvet carpet from Aladdins palace to the Sultans. Aladdins mother then dressed herself carefully and walked to the palace with her slaves while he followed her on horseback. The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them so that the air resounded with music and cheers. She was taken to the princess who saluted her and treated her with great honor. At night the princess said goodbye to her father and set out on the carpet for Aladdins palace with his mother at her side and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the sight of Aladdin who ran to receive her.Princess he said blame your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.She told him that having seen him she willingly obeyed her father in this matter. After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into the hall where a feast was spread and she supped with him after which they danced till midnight.Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On entering the hall with the fourandtwenty windows with their rubies diamonds and emeralds he criedIt is a worlds wonder There is only one thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was left unfinishedNo sir by design returned Aladdin. I wished your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace.The Sultan was pleased and sent for the best jewelers in the city. He showed them the unfinished window and bade them fit it up like the others.Sir replied their spokesman we cannot find enough jewels.The Sultan had his own fetched which they soon used but to no purpose for in a months time the work was not half done. Aladdin knowing that their task was vain bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back and the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited Aladdin who showed him the window finished. The Sultan embraced him the envious vizir meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment.Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing. He was made captain of the Sultans armies and won several battles for him but remained modest and courteous as before and lived thus in peace and content for several years.But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin and by his magic arts discovered that Aladdin instead of perishing miserably in the cave had escaped and had married a princess with whom he was living in great honor and wealth. He knew that the poor tailors son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp and traveled night and day till he reached the capital of China bent on Aladdins ruin. As he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvelous palace.Forgive my ignorance he asked what is this palace you speak ofHave you not heard of Prince Aladdins palace was the reply the greatest wonder of the world I will direct you if you have a mind to see it.The magician thanked him who spoke and having seen the palace he knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp and became half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the lamp and again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.Unluckily Aladdin had gone hunting for eight days which gave the magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps put them into a basket and went to the palace crying New lamps for old followed by a jeering crowd.The princess sitting in the hall of fourandtwenty windows sent a slave to find out what the noise was about who came back laughing so that the princess scolded her.Madam replied the slave who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old onesAnother slave hearing this said There is an old one on the cornice there which he can have.Now this was the magic lamp which Aladdin had left there as he could not take it out hunting with him. The princess not knowing its value laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange.She went and said to the magician Give me a new lamp for this.He snatched it and bade the slave take her choice amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared but left off crying his lamps and went out of the city gates to a lonely place where he remained till nightfall when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared and at the magicians command carried him together with the palace and the princess in it to a lonely place in Africa.Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window towards Aladdins palace and rubbed his eyes for it was gone. He sent for the vizir and asked what had become of the palace. The vizir looked out too and was lost in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment and this time the Sultan believed him and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains. They met him riding home bound him and forced him to go with them on foot. The people however who loved him followed armed to see that he came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan who ordered the executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made Aladdin kneel down bandaged his eyes and raised his scimitar to strike.At that instant the vizir who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue Aladdin called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people indeed looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be unbound and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd.Aladdin now begged to know what he had done.False wretch said the Sultan come hither and showed him from the window the place where his palace had stood.Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word.Where is my palace and my daughter demanded the Sultan. For the first I am not so deeply concerned but my daughter I must have and you must find her or lose your head.Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her promising if he failed to return and suffer death at the Sultans pleasure. His prayer was granted and he went forth sadly from the Sultans presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman asking everyone what had become of his palace but they only laughed and pitied him. He came to the banks of a river and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore.The genie he had seen in the cave appeared and asked his will.Save my life genie said Aladdin and bring my palace back.That is not in my power said the genie I am only the slave of the ring you must ask the slave of the lamp.Even so said Aladdin but you can take me to the palace and set me down under my dear wifes window. He at once found himself in Africa under the window of the princess and fell asleep out of sheer weariness.He was awakened by the singing of the birds and his heart was lighter. He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician whose company she was forced to endure once a day. She however treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether. As she was dressing one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin. The princess ran and opened the window and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again.After he had kissed her Aladdin said I beg of you Princess in Gods name before we speak of anything else for your own sake and mine tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of fourandtwenty windows when I went ahunting.Alas she said I am the innocent cause of our sorrows and told him of the exchange of the lamp.Now I know cried Aladdin that we have to thank the African magician for this Where is the lampHe carries it about with him said the princess I know for he pulled it out of his breast to show me. He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him saying that you were beheaded by my fathers command. He is forever speaking ill of you but I only reply by my tears. If I persist I doubt not that he will use violence.Aladdin comforted her and left her for a while. He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town and having bought a certain powder returned to the princess who let him in by a little side door.Put on your most beautiful dress he said to her and receive the magician with smiles leading him to believe that you have forgotten me. Invite him to dine with you and say you wish to taste the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will tell you what to do.She listened carefully to Aladdin and when he left her arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She put on a girdle and a headdress of diamonds and seeing in a mirror that she looked more beautiful than ever received the magician saying to his great amazement I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead and that all my tears will not bring him back to me so I am resolved to mourn no more and have therefore invited you to sup with me but I am tired of the wines of China and would be pleased to taste those of Africa.The magician flew to his cellar and the princess put the powder Aladdin had given her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to drink her health in the wine of Africa handing him her cup in exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him.Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty but the princess cut him short sayingLet me drink first and you shall say what you will afterwards. She set her cup to her lips and kept it there while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless.The princess then opened the door to Aladdin and flung her arms round his neck but Aladdin put her away bidding her to leave him as he had more to do. He then went to the dead magician took the lamp out of his vest and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to China. This was done and the princess in her chamber only felt two little shocks and little thought she was at home again.The Sultan who was sitting in his closet mourning for his lost daughter happened to look up and rubbed his eyes for there stood the palace as before He hastened thither and Aladdin received him in the hall of the fourandtwenty windows with the princess at his side. Aladdin told him what had happened and showed him the dead body of the magician that he might believe. A ten days feast was proclaimed and it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace but it was not to be.The African magician had a younger brother who was if possible more wicked and more cunning than himself. He traveled to China to avenge his brothers death and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima thinking she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He changed clothes with her colored his face like hers put on her veil and murdered her that she might tell no tales. Then he went towards the palace of Aladdin and all the people thinking he was the holy woman gathered round him kissing his hands and begging his blessing.When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter. The slave said it was the holy woman curing people by her touch of their ailments whereupon the princess who had long desired to see Fatima sent for her. On coming to the princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done the princess made him sit by her and begged him to stay with her always. The false Fatima who wished for nothing better consented but kept his veil down for fear of discovery. The princess showed him the hall and asked him what he thought of it.It is truly beautiful said the false Fatima. In my mind it wants but one thing.And what is that said the princess.If only a rocs egg replied he were hung up from the middle of this dome it would be the wonder of the world.After this the princess could think of nothing but a rocs egg and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor. He begged to know what was amiss and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a rocs egg hanging from the dome.It that is all replied Aladdin you shall soon be happy.He left her and rubbed the lamp and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a rocs egg. The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook.Wretch he cried is it not enough that I have done everything for you but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome You and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes but this request does not come from you but from the brother of the African magician whom you destroyed. He is now in your palace disguised as the holy womanwhom he murdered. It was he who put that wish into your wifes head. Take care of yourself for he means to kill you. So saying the genie disappeared.Aladdin went back to the princess saying his head ached and requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when the magician came near Aladdin seizing his dagger pierced him to the heart.What have you done cried the princess. You have killed the holy womanNot so replied Aladdin but a wicked magician and told her of how she had been deceived.After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace. He succeeded the Sultan when he died and reigned for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings.
By the highroad in the forest lay a lonely peasants hut the road went right through the farmyard. The sun shone down and all the windows were open. In the house was bustle and movement but in the garden in an arbour of blossoming elder stood an open coffin. A dead man had been carried out here and he was to be buried this morning. Nobody stood by the coffin and looked sorrowfully at the dead man no one shed a tear for him his face was covered with a white cloth and under his head lay a great thick book whose leaves consisted of whole sheets of blotting paper and on each leaf lay a faded flower. It was a complete herbanum gathered by him in various places it was to be buried with him for so he had wished it. With each flower a chapter in his life was associated.Who is the dead man we asked and the answer wasThe Old Student. They say he was once a brisk lad and studied the old languages and sang and even wrote poems. Then something happened to him that made him turn his thoughts to brandy and take to it and when at last he had ruined his health he came out here into the country where somebody paid for his board and lodging. He was as gentle as a child except when the dark mood came upon him but when it came he became like a giant and then ran about in the woods like a hunted stag but when we once got him home again and prevailed with him so far that he opened the book with the dried plants he often sat whole days and looked sometimes at one plant and sometimes at another and at times the tears rolled over his cheeks Heaven knows what he was thinking of. But he begged us to put the book into the coffin and now he lies there and in a little while the lid will be nailed down and he will have his quiet rest in the grave.The facecloth was raised and there was peace upon the features of the dead man and a sunbeam played upon it a swallow shot with arrowy flight into the arbour and turned rapidly and twittered over the dead mans head.What a strange feeling it isand we have doubtless all experienced itthat of turning over old letters of the days of our youth a new life seems to come up with them with all its hopes and sorrows. How many persons with whom we were intimate in those days are as it were dead to us and yet they are alive but for a long time we have not thought of themof them whom we then thought to hold fast for ages and with whom we were to share sorrow and joy.Here the withered oakleaf in the book reminded the owner of the friend the schoolfellow who was to be a friend for life he fastened the green leaf in the students cap in the green wood when the bond was made for life where does he live now The leaf is preserved but the friendship has perished And here is a foreign hothouse plant too delicate for the gardens of the North the leaves almost seem to keep their fragrance still. She gave it to him the young lady in the noblemans garden. Here is the water rose which he plucked himself and moistened with salt tearsthe roses of the sweet waters. And here is a nettlewhat tale may its leaves have to tell What were his thoughts when he plucked it and kept it Here is a lily of the valley from the solitudes of the forest. Heres an evergreen from the flowerpot of the tavern and heres a naked sharp blade of grass.The blooming elder waves its fresh fragrant blossoms over the dead mans head and the swallow flies past again. Peewit peewit And now the men come with nails and hammers and the lid is laid over the dead man that his head may rest upon the dumb bookvanished and scattered
Three brothers and one sister lived together in a small cottage and they loved one another dearly. One day the eldest brother who had never done anything but amuse himself from sunrise to sunset said to the rest Let us all work hard and perhaps we shall grow rich and be able to build ourselves a palace.And his brothers and sister answered joyfully Yes we will all workSo they fell to working with all their might till at last they became rich and were able to build themselves a beautiful palace and everyone came from miles round to see its wonders and to say how splendid it was. No one thought of finding any faults till at length an old woman who had been walking through the rooms with a crowd of people suddenly exclaimed Yes it is a splendid palace but there is still something it needsAnd what may that beA church.When they heard this the brothers set to work again to earn some more money and when they had got enough they set about building a church which should be as large and beautiful as the palace itself.And after the church was finished greater numbers of people than ever flocked to see the palace and the church and vast gardens and magnificent halls.But one day as the brothers were as usual doing the honours to their guests an old man turned to them and said Yes it is all most beautiful but there is still something it needsAnd what may that beA pitcher of the water of life a branch of the tree the smell of whose flowers gives eternal beauty and the talking bird.And where am I to find all thoseGo to the mountain that is far off yonder and you will find what you seek.After the old man had bowed politely and taken farewell of them the eldest brother said to the rest I will go in search of the water of life and the talking bird and the tree of beauty.But suppose some evil thing befalls you asked his sister. How shall we knowYou are right he replied  I had not thought of thatThen they followed the old man and said to him My eldest brother wishes to seek for the water of life and the tree of beauty and the talking bird that you tell him are needful to make our palace perfect. But how shall we know if any evil thing befall himSo the old man took them a knife and gave it to them saying Keep this carefully and as long as the blade is bright all is well but if the blade is bloody then know that evil has befallen him.The brothers thanked him and departed and went straight to the palace where they found the young man making ready to set out for the mountain where the treasures he longed for lay hid.And he walked and he walked and he walked till he had gone a great way and there he met a giant.Can you tell me how much further I have still to go before I reach that mountain yonderAnd why do you wish to go thereI am seeking the water of life the talking bird and a branch of the tree of beauty.Many have passed by seeking those treasures but none have ever come back and you will never come back either unless you mark my words. Follow this path and when you reach the mountain you will find it covered with stones. Do not stop to look at them but keep on your way. As you go you will hear scoffs and laughs behind you it will be the stones that mock. Do not heed them above all do not turn round. If you do you will become as one of them. Walk straight on till you get to the top and then take all you wish for.The young man thanked him for his counsel and walked and walked and walked till he reached the mountain. And as he climbed he heard behind him scoffs and jeers but he kept his ears steadily closed to them. At last the noise grew so loud that he lost patience and he stooped to pick up a stone to hurl into the midst of the clamour when suddenly his arm seemed to stiffen and the next moment he was a stone himselfThat day his sister who thought her brothers steps were long in returning took out the knife and found the blade was red as blood. Then she cried out to her brothers that something terrible had come to pass.I will go and find him said the second. And he went.And he walked and he walked and he walked till he met the giant and asked him if he had seen a young man travelling towards the mountain.And the giant answered Yes I have seen him pass but I have not seen him come back. The spell must have worked upon him.Then what can I do to disenchant him and find the water of life the talking bird and a branch of the tree of beautyFollow this path and when you reach the mountain you will find it covered with stones. Do not stop to look at them but climb steadily on. Above all heed not the laughs and scoffs that will arise on all sides and never turn round. And when you reach the top you can then take all you desire.The young man thanked him for his counsel and set out for the mountain. But no sooner did he reach it than loud jests and gibes broke out on every side and almost deafened him. For some time he let them rail and pushed boldly on till he had passed the place which his brother had gained then suddenly he thought that among the scoffing sounds he heard his brothers voice. He stopped and looked back and another stone was added to the number.Meanwhile the sister left at home was counting the days when her two brothers should return to her. The time seemed long and it would be hard to say how often she took out the knife and looked at its polished blade to make sure that this one at least was still safe. The blade was always bright and clear each time she looked she had the happiness of knowing that all was well till one evening tired and anxious as she frequently was at the end of the day she took it from its drawer and behold the blade was red with blood. Her cry of horror brought her youngest brother to her and unable to speak she held out the knifeI will go he said.So he walked and he walked and he walked until he met the giant and he asked Have two young men making for yonder mountain passed this wayAnd the giant answered Yes they have passed by but they never came back and by this I know that the spell has fallen upon them.Then what must I do to free them and to get the water of life and the talking bird and the branch of the tree of beautyGo to the mountain which you will find so thickly covered with stones that you will hardly be able to place your feet and walk straight forward turning neither to the right hand nor to the left and paying no heed to the laughs and scoffs which will follow you till you reach the top and then you may take all that you desire.The young man thanked the giant for his counsel and set forth to the mountain. And when he began to climb there burst forth all around him a storm of scoffs and jeers but he thought of the giants words and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left till the mountain top lay straight before him. A moment now and he would have gained it when through the groans and yells he heard his brothers voices. He turned and there was one stone the more.And all this while his sister was pacing up and down the palace hardly letting the knife out of her hand and dreading what she knew she would see and what she did see. The blade grew red before her eyes and she said Now it is my turn.So she walked and she walked and she walked till she came to the giant and prayed him to tell her if he had seen three young men pass that way seeking the distant mountain.I have seen them pass but they have never returned and by this I know that the spell has fallen upon them.And what must I do to set them free and to find the water of life and the talking bird and a branch of the tree of beautyYou must go to that mountain which is so full of stones that your feet will hardly find a place to tread and as you climb you will hear a noise as if all the stones in the world were mocking you but pay no heed to anything you may hear and once you gain the top you have gained everything.The girl thanked him for his counsel and set out for the mountain and scarcely had she gone a few steps upwards when cries and screams broke forth around her and she felt as if each stone she trod on was a living thing. But she remembered the words of the giant and knew not what had befallen her brothers and kept her face steadily towards the mountain top which grew nearer and nearer every moment. But as she mounted the clamour increased sevenfold high above them all rang the voices of her three brothers. But the girl took no heed and at last her feet stood upon the top.Then she looked round and saw lying in a hollow the pool of the water of life. And she took the brazen pitcher that she had brought with her and filled it to the brim. By the side of the pool stood the tree of beauty with the talking bird on one of its boughs and she caught the bird and placed it in a cage and broke off one of the branches.After that she turned and went joyfully down the hill again carrying her treasures but her long climb had tired her out and the brazen pitcher was very heavy and as she walked a few drops of the water spilt on the stones and as it touched them they changed into young men and maidens crowding about her to give thanks for their deliverance.So she learnt by this how the evil spell might be broken and she carefully sprinkled every stone till there was not one leftonly a great company of youths and girls who followed her down the mountain.When they arrived at the palace she did not lose a moment in planting the branch of the tree of beauty and watering it with the water of life. And the branch shot up into a tree and was heavy with flowers and the talking bird nestled in its branches.Now the fame of these wonders was noised abroad and the people flocked in great numbers to see the three marvels and the maiden who had won them and among the sightseers came the kings son who would not go till everything was shown him and till he had heard how it had all happened. And the prince admired the strangeness and beauty of the treasures in the palace but more than all he admired the beauty and courage of the maiden who had brought them there. So he went home and told his parents and gained their consent to wed her for his wife.Then the marriage was celebrated in the church adjoining the palace. Then the bridegroom took her to his own home where they lived happy for ever after.
And now I wish that I could end my story pleasantly but it is no fault of mine that I cannot. The old songs end it sadly and I believe that they are right and wise for though the heroes were purified at Malea yet sacrifices cannot make bad hearts good and Jason had taken a wicked wife and he had to bear his burden to the last.And first she laid a cunning plot to punish that poor old Pelias instead of letting him die in peace.For she told his daughters I can make old things young again I will show you how easy it is to do. So she took an old ram and killed him and put him in a cauldron with magic herbs and whispered her spells over him and he leapt out again a young lamb. So that Medeias cauldron is a proverb still by which we mean times of war and change when the world has become old and feeble and grows young again through bitter pains.Then she said to Peliass daughters Do to your father as I did to this ram and he will grow young and strong again. But she only told them half the spell so they failed while Medeia mocked them and poor old Pelias died and his daughters came to misery. But the songs say she cured son Jasons father and he became young and strong again.But Jason could not love her after all her cruel deeds. So he was ungrateful to her and wronged her and she revenged herself on him. And a terrible revenge she tooktoo terrible to speak of here. But you will hear of it yourselves when you grow up for it has been sung in noble poetry and music and whether it be true or not it stands forever as a warning to us not to seek for help from evil persons or to gain good ends by evil means. For if we use an adder even against our enemies it will turn again and sting us.But of all the other heroes there is many a brave tale left which I have no space to tell you so you must read them for yourselvesof the hunting of the boar in Calydon which Meleager killed and of Heracless twelve famous labours and of the seven who fought at Thebes and of the noble love of Castor and Polydeuces the twin Dioscouroihow when one died the other would not live without him so they shared their immortality between them and Zeus changed them into the two twin stars which never rise both at once.And what became of Cheiron the good immortal beast That too is a sad story for the heroes never saw him more. He was wounded by a poisoned arrow at Pholoe among the hills when Heracles opened the fatal winejar which Cheiron had warned him not to touch. And the Centaurs smelt the wine and flocked to it and fought for it with Heracles but he killed them all with his poisoned arrows and Cheiron was left alone. Then Cheiron took up one of the arrows and dropped it by chance upon his foot and the poison ran like fire along his veins and he lay down and longed to die and cried Through wine I perish the bane of all my race. Why should I live forever in this agony Who will take my immortality that I may dieThen Prometheus answered the good Titan whom Heracles had set free from Caucasus I will take your immortality and live forever that I may help poor mortal men. So Cheiron gave him his immortality and died and had rest from pain. And Heracles and Prometheus wept over him and went to bury him on Pelion but Zeus took him up among the stars to live forever grand and mild low down in the far southern sky.And in time the heroes died all but Nestor the silvertongued old man and left behind them valiant sons but not so great as they had been. Yet their fame too lives till this day for they fought at the ten years siege of Troy and their story is in the book which we call Homer in two of the noblest songs on earththe Iliad which tells us of the siege of Troy and Achilles quarrel with the kings and the Odyssey which tells the wanderings of Odysseus through many lands for many years and how Alcinous sent him home at last safe to Ithaca his beloved island and to Penelope his faithful wife and Telemachus his son and Euphorbus the noble swineherd and the old dog who licked his hand and died. We will read that sweet story children by the fire some winter night. And now I will end my tale and begin another and a more cheerful one of a hero who became a worthy king and won his peoples love.
There once lived a queen who ruled over the Flowery Isles whose husband to her extreme grief died a few years after their marriage. On being left a widow she devoted herself almost entirely to the education of the two charming princesses her only children. The elder of them was so lovely that as she grew up her mother greatly feared she would excite the jealousy of the Queen of all the Isles who prided herself on being the most beautiful woman in the world and insisted on all rivals bowing before her charms.In order the better to gratify her vanity she had urged the king her husband to make war on all the surrounding islands and as his greatest wish was to please her the only conditions he imposed on any newlyconquered country was that each princess of every royal house should attend his court as soon as she was fifteen years old and do homage to the transcendent beauty of his queen.The queen of the Flowery Isles well aware of this law was fully determined to present her daughter to the proud queen as soon as her fifteenth birthday was past.The queen herself had heard a rumour of the young princesss great beauty and awaited her visit with some anxiety which soon developed into jealousy for when the interview took place it was impossible not to be dazzled by such radiant charms and she was obliged to admit that she had never beheld anyone so exquisitely lovely.Of course she thought in her own mind excepting myself for nothing could have made her believe it possible that anyone could eclipse her.But the outspoken admiration of the entire court soon undeceived her and made her so angry that she pretended illness and retired to her own rooms so as to avoid witnessing the princesss triumph. She also sent word to the Queen of the Flowery Isles that she was sorry not to be well enough to see her again and advised her to return to her own states with the princess her daughter.This message was entrusted to one of the great ladies of the court who was an old friend of the Queen of the Flowery Isles and who advised her not to wait to take a formal leave but to go home as fast as she could.The queen was not slow to take the hint and lost no time in obeying it. Being well aware of the magic powers of the incensed queen she warned her daughter that she was threatened by some great danger if she left the palace for any reason whatever during the next six months.The princess promised obedience and no pains were spared to make the time pass pleasantly for her.The six months were nearly at an end and on the very last day a splendid fte was to take place in a lovely meadow quite near the palace. The princess who had been able to watch all the preparations from her window implored her mother to let her go as far as the meadow and the queen thinking all risk must be over consented and promised to take her there herself.The whole court was delighted to see their muchloved princess at liberty and everyone set off in high glee to join in the fte.The princess overjoyed at being once more in the open air was walking a little in advance of her party when suddenly the earth opened under her feet and closed again after swallowing her upThe queen fainted away with terror and the younger princess burst into floods of tears and could hardly be dragged away from the fatal spot whilst the court was overwhelmed with horror at so great a calamity.Orders were given to bore the earth to a great depth but in vain not a trace of the vanished princess was to be found.She sank right through the earth and found herself in a desert place with nothing but rocks and trees and no sign of any human being. The only living creature she saw was a very pretty little dog who ran up to her and at once began to caress her. She took him in her arms and after playing with him for a little put him down again when he started off in front of her looking round from time to time as though begging her to follow.She let him lead her on and presently reached a little hill from which she saw a valley full of lovely fruit trees bearing flowers and fruit together. The ground was also covered with fruit and flowers and in the middle of the valley rose a fountain surrounded by a velvety lawn.The princess hastened to this charming spot and sitting down on the grass began to think over the misfortune which had befallen her and burst into tears as she reflected on her sad condition.The fruit and clear fresh water would she knew prevent her from dying of hunger or thirst but how could she escape if any wild beast appeared and tried to devour herAt length having thought over every possible evil which could happen the princess tried to distract her mind by playing with the little dog. She spent the whole day near the fountain but as night drew on she wondered what she should do when she noticed that the little dog was pulling at her dress.She paid no heed to him at first but as he continued to pull her dress and then run a few steps in one particular direction she at last decided to follow him he stopped before a rock with a large opening in the centre which he evidently wished her to enter.The princess did so and discovered a large and beautiful cave lit up by the brilliancy of the stones with which it was lined with a little couch covered with soft moss in one corner. She lay down on it and the dog at once nestled at her feet. Tired out with all she had gone through she soon fell asleep.Next morning she was awakened very early by the songs of many birds. The little dog woke up too and sprang round her in his most caressing manner. She got up and went outside the dog as before running on in front and turning back constantly to take her dress and draw her on.She let him have his way and he soon led her back to the beautiful garden where she had spent part of the day before. Here she ate some fruit drank some water of the fountain and felt as if she had made an excellent meal. She walked about amongst the flowers played with her little dog and at night returned to sleep in the cave.In this way the princess passed several months and as her first terrors died away she gradually became more resigned to her fate. The little dog too was a great comfort and her constant companion.One day she noticed that he seemed very sad and did not even caress her as usual. Fearing he might be ill she carried him to a spot where she had seen him eat some particular herbs hoping they might do him good but he would not touch them. He spent all the night too sighing and groaning as if in great pain.At last the princess fell asleep and when she awoke her first thought was for her little pet but not finding him at her feet as usual she ran out of the cave to look for him. As she stepped out of the cave she caught sight of an old man who hurried away so fast that she had barely time to see him before he disappeared.This was a fresh surprise and almost as great a shock as the loss of her little dog who had been so faithful to her ever since the first day she had seen him. She wondered if he had strayed away or if the old man had stolen him.Tormented by all kinds of thoughts and fears she wandered on when suddenly she felt herself wrapped in a thick cloud and carried through the air. She made no resistance and before very long found herself to her great surprise in an avenue leading to the palace in which she had been born. No sign of the cloud anywhere.As the princess approached the palace she perceived that everyone was dressed in black and she was filled with fear as to the cause of this mourning. She hastened on and was soon recognised and welcomed with shouts of joy. Her sister hearing the cheers ran out and embraced the wanderer with tears of happiness telling her that the shock of her disappearance had been so terrible that their mother had only survived it a few days. Since then the younger princess had worn the crown which she now resigned to her sister to whom it by right belonged.But the elder wished to refuse it and would only accept the crown on condition that her sister should share in all the power.The first acts of the new queen were to do honour to the memory of her dear mother and to shower every mark of generous affection on her sister. Then being still very grieved at the loss of her little dog she had a careful search made for him in every country and when nothing could be heard of him she was so grieved that she offered half her kingdom to whoever should restore him to her.Many gentlemen of the court tempted by the thought of such a reward set off in all directions in search of the dog but all returned emptyhanded to the queen who in despair announced that since life was unbearable without her little dog she would give her hand in marriage to the man who brought him back.The prospect of such a prize quickly turned the court into a desert nearly every courtier starting on the quest. Whilst they were away the queen was informed one day that a very illlooking man wished to speak with her. She desired him to be shown into a room where she was sitting with her sister.On entering her presence he said that he was prepared to give the queen her little dog if she on her side was ready to keep her word.The princess was the first to speak. She said that the queen had no right to marry without the consent of the nation and that on so important an occasion the general council must be summoned. The queen could not say anything against this statement but she ordered an apartment in the palace to be given to the man and desired the council to meet on the following day.Next day accordingly the council assembled in great state and by the princesss advice it was decided to offer the man a large sum of money for the dog and should he refuse it to banish him from the kingdom without seeing the queen again. The man refused the price offered and left the hall.The princess informed the queen of what had passed and the queen approved of all but added that as she was her own mistress she had made up her mind to abdicate her throne and to wander through the world till she had found her little dog.The princess was much alarmed by such a resolution and implored the queen to change her mind. Whilst they were discussing the subject one of the chamberlains appeared to inform the queen that the bay was covered with ships. The two sisters ran to the balcony and saw a large fleet in full sail for the port.In a little time they came to the conclusion that the ships must come from a friendly nation as every vessel was decked with gay flags streamers and pennons and the way was led by a small ship flying a great white flag of peace.The queen sent a special messenger to the harbour and was soon informed that the fleet belonged to the Prince of the Emerald Isles who begged leave to land in her kingdom and to present his humble respects to her. The queen at once sent some of the court dignitaries to receive the prince and bid him welcome.She awaited him seated on her throne but rose on his appearance and went a few steps to meet him then begged him to be seated and for about an hour kept him in close conversation.The prince was then conducted to a splendid suite of apartments and the next day he asked for a private audience. He was admitted to the queens own sitting room where she was sitting alone with her sister.After the first greetings the prince informed the queen that he had some very strange things to tell her which she only would know to be true.Madam said he I am a neighbour of the Queen of all the Isles and a small isthmus connects part of my states with hers. One day when hunting a stag I had the misfortune to meet her and not recognising her I did not stop to salute her with all proper ceremony. You Madam know better than anyone how revengeful she is and that she is also a mistress of magic. I learnt both facts to my cost. The ground opened under my feet and I soon found myself in a far distant region transformed into a little dog under which shape I had the honour to meet your Majesty. After six months the queens vengeance not being yet satisfied she further changed me into a hideous old man and in this form I was so afraid of being unpleasant in your eyes Madam that I hid myself in the depths of the woods where I spent three months more. At the end of that time I was so fortunate as to meet a benevolent fairy who delivered me from the proud queens power and told me all your adventures and where to find you. I now come to offer you a heart which has been entirely yours Madam since first we met in the desert.A few days later a herald was sent through the kingdom to proclaim the joyful news of the marriage of the Queen of the Flowery Isles with the young prince. They lived happily for many years and ruled their people well.As for the bad queen whose vanity and jealousy had caused so much mischief the Fairies took all her power away for a punishment.
A Swallow was once boasting to a Crow about her birth. I was once a princess said she the daughter of a King of Athens but my husband used me cruelly and cut out my tongue for a slight fault. Then to protect me from further injury I was turned by Juno into a bird. You chatter quite enough as it is said the Crow. What you would have been like if you hadnt lost your tongue I cant think.
A Goatherd had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain the straggler paid no attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone and breaking its horn begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied Why you silly fellow the horn will speak though I be silent.Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.
A peasant named John Wilde who lived in Rodenkirchen found one time a little glass shoe on one of the hills where the little people used to dance. He clapped it instantly in his pocket and ran away with it keeping his hand as close on his pocket as if he had a dove in it for he knew he had found a treasure which the underground people must redeem at any price.Others say that John Wilde lay in ambush one night for the underground people and snatched an opportunity to pull off one of their shoes by stretching himself there with a brandy bottle beside him and acting like one that was dead drunk for he was a very cunning man not over scrupulous in his morals and had taken in many a one by his craftiness and on this account his name was in no good repute among his neighbours who to say the truth were willing to have as little to do with him as possible. Many hold too that he was acquainted with forbidden acts and used to carry on an intercourse with the fiends and old women that raised storms and such like.However be this as it may when John had got the shoe he lost no time in letting the folk that dwell under the ground know that he had it. At midnight he went to the Ninehills and cried with all his mightJohn Wilde of Rodenkirchen has got a beautiful glass shoe. Who will buy it who will buy it for he knew that the little one who had lost the shoe must go barefoot till he got it again and that is no trifle for the little people have generally to walk upon very hard and stony ground.Johns advertisement was speedily attended to. The little fellow who had lost the shoe made no delay in setting about redeeming it. The first free day he got that he might come out in the daylight he came as a respectable merchant knocked at John Wildes door and asked if John had not got a glass shoe to sellFor says he they are an article now in great demand and are sought for in every market.John replied that it was true that he had a very pretty little glass shoe but it was so small that even a dwarfs foot would be squeezed in it and that a person must be made on purpose to suit it before it could be of use. For all that it was an extraordinary shoe a valuable shoe and a dear shoe and it was not every merchant that could afford to pay for it.The merchant asked to see it and when he had examined itGlass shoes said he are not by any means such rare articles my good friend as you think here in Rodenkirchen because you do not happen to go much into the world. However said he after humming a little I will give you a good price for it because I happen to have the very fellow of it.He bid the countryman a thousand dollars for it.A thousand dollars are money my father used to say when he drove fat oxen to market replied John Wilde in a mocking tone but it will not leave my hands for that shabby price and for my own part it may ornament the foot of my daughters doll Hark ye my friend I have heard a sort of little song sung about the glass shoe and it is not for a parcel of dirt it will go out of my hands. Tell me now my good fellow should you happen to know the knack of it how in every furrow I make when I am ploughing I may find a ducat If not the shoe is still mine and you may inquire for glass shoes at those other markets.The merchant made still a great many attempts and twisted and turned in every direction to get the shoe but when he found the farmer inflexible he agreed to what John desired and swore to the performance of it. Cunning John believed him and gave him up the glass shoe for he knew right well with whom he had to do. So the business being ended away went the merchant with his glass shoe.Without a moments delay John repaired to his stable got ready his horses and his plough and went out to the field. He selected a piece of ground where he would have the shortest turns possible and began to plough. Hardly had the plough turned up the first sod when up sprang a ducat out of the ground and it was the same with every fresh furrow he made. There was now no end of his ploughing and John Wilde soon bought eight new horses and put them into the stable to the eight he already had and their mangers were never without plenty of oats in them that he might be able every two hours to yoke two fresh horses and so be enabled to drive them the faster.John was now insatiable in ploughing. Every morning he was out before sunrise and many a time he ploughed on till after midnight. Summer and winter it was plough plough with him evermore except when the ground was frozen as hard as a stone. He always ploughed by himself and never suffered any one to go out with him or to come to him when he was at work for John understood too well the nature of his crop to let people see for what it was he ploughed so constantly.However it fared far worse with him than with his horses who ate good oats and were regularly changed and relieved for he grew pale and meagre by reason of his continual working and toiling. His wife and children had no longer any comfort for him. He never went to the alehouse or to the club. He withdrew himself from every one and scarcely ever spoke a single word but went about silent and wrapped up in his own thoughts. All the day long he toiled for his ducats and at night he had to count them and to plan and meditate how he might find out a still swifter kind of plough.His wife and the neighbours lamented over his strange conduct his dulness and melancholy and began to think he was grown foolish. Everybody pitied his wife and children for they imagined the numerous horses that he kept in his stable and the preposterous mode of agriculture he pursued with his unnecessary and superfluous ploughing must soon leave him without house or land.Their anticipations however were not fulfilled. True it is the poor man never enjoyed a happy or contented hour since he began to plough the ducats up out of the ground. The old saying held good in his case that he who gives himself up to the pursuit of gold is halfway in the claws of the evil one. Flesh and blood cannot bear perpetual labour and John Wilde did not long hold out against his running through the furrows day and night. He got through the first spring but one day in the second he dropped down at the tail of the plough like an exhausted November fly. Out of the pure thirst for gold he was wasted away and dried up to nothing whereas he had been a very strong and hearty man the day the shoe of the little underground man fell into his hands.His wife however found he had left a great treasuretwo great nailedup chests full of good new ducats and his sons purchased large estates for themselves and became lords and noblemen.But what good did all that to poor John Wilde
There was once a cobbler who one day was so tired of cobbling that he said Now I will go and seek my fortune. He bought a little cheese and put it on the table. It got full of flies and he took an old shoe and hit the cheese and killed all the flies. He afterward counted them and five hundred were killed and four hundred wounded. He then girded on a sword and put on a cocked hat and went to the court and said to the king I am the chief warrior of the flies. Four hundred I have killed and five hundred I have wounded. The king answered Since you are a warrior you will be brave enough to climb that mountain there where there are two magicians and kill them. If you kill them you shall marry my daughter. Then he gave him a white flag to wave when he had killed them. And sound the trumpet you will put his head in a bag both the heads to show me.The cobbler then departed and found a house which was an inn and the innkeeper and his wife were none other than the magician and his wife. He asked for lodging and food and all he needed. Afterward he went to his room but before going to bed he looked up at the ceiling. There he saw a great stone over the bed. Instead of getting into bed he got into a corner. When a certain hour struck the magicians let the stone drop and it crushed the whole bed. The next morning the cobbler went down and said that he could not sleep for the noise. They told him they would change his room. The same thing happened the next night and in the morning they told him they would give him another room. When it was a certain hour the husband and wife went to the forest to cut a bundle of fagots.Then the magician went home and the cobbler who had made ready a sickle said Wait until I help you to take the bundle off your back. Then he gave the magician a blow with the sickle and cut off his head. He did the same thing when the magicians wife returned. Then he unfurled his flag and sounded his trumpet and the band went out to meet him. After he had arrived at the court the king said to him Now that you have killed the two magicians you shall marry my daughter. But the cobbler had got so used to drawing the thread that he did so in his sleep and kept hitting his wife so that she could not rest. Then the king gave him a great deal of money and sent him home.
Once upon a time there was a father with three sons who had reached the age when they must go out into the world to earn their own living. When the time for parting came he gave to each of them a large melon with the advice that they open the melons only at a place where there was water nearby.The three brothers set out from their fathers house each taking a different path. As soon as the eldest son was out of sight of the house he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang out of the melon saying Give me water or give me milk. There was no water nearby and neither did the young man have any milk to give her. She fell down dead.The second son left his fathers house by a path which led over a steep hill. The large melon was heavy to carry and in a little while he became very tired and thirsty. He saw no water nearby and feared that there was no possibility of finding any soon so he thought he would open the melon and use it to quench his thirst. Accordingly he opened his melon. To his great surprise a beautiful maiden sprang forth saying Give me water or give me milk. Of course he had neither to give her and she fell down dead.The third son also travelled by a path which led over a steep hill. He too became very tired and thirsty and he often thought how much he would like to open his melon. However he remembered his fathers advice to open it only where there was water nearby. So he travelled on and on hoping to find a spring of water on the hillside. He did not have the good fortune to pass near a spring either going up the hill or coming down on the opposite side. At the foot of the hill there was a town and in the centre of the town there was a fountain. The young man hurried straight to the fountain and took a long refreshing drink. Then he opened his melon. A beautiful maiden sprang forth saying Give me water or give me milk. The young man gave her a drink of water. Then he helped her to a hiding place among the thick branches of the tree which grew beside the fountain and went away in search of food.Soon a little black servant girl came to the fountain to fill a big water jar which she carried on her head. The maiden in the tree above the fountain peeped out through the branches. When the little black servant girl bent over the water to fill her jar she saw the reflection of a charming face in the water. How beautiful I have become she said to herself. How ridiculous that any one as beautiful as I am should carry water on her head. She threw her water jar upon the ground in disdain and it broke into a thousand pieces.When the little maid reached home with neither water nor water jar her mistress punished her severely and sent her again to the fountain with a new water jar to fill. This time the maiden in the tree gave a little silvery laugh when the black servant girl bent over the water. The little maid looked up and spied her in the tree. O it is you is it who are responsible for my beating she said. She pulled a pin out of her camisa and reaching up she stuck it savagely into the beautiful maiden in the tree. Then a strange thing happened. There was no longer any beautiful maiden in the tree. There was just a pigeon there.At that moment the young man came back to the tree with the food he had procured. When the little black maid heard his footsteps she was frightened nearly to death. She hid herself quickly among the thick branches of the tree. The young man was very much surprised to find a little black maid in the tree in the place of the beautiful maiden he had left there. What has happened to you during my absence he asked in horror as soon as he saw her. The sun has burned my complexion. That is all. It is nothing. I shall be myself again when I get away from this hot place the little maid replied.The young man married the little black maid and took her away out of sunny places hoping that she would soon be again the beautiful maiden she was when he left her by the fountain in search of food. But she always remained black.Years passed and the young man became very rich. He lived in a beautiful mansion. All around the house there was a wonderful garden full of lovely flowers and splendid trees where birds loved to sing sweet songs and build their nests. In spite of his beautiful home the young man was not very happy. It was a great trial to have a wife who was so black. He often walked up and down the paths in his garden at the close of the day and thought about how beautiful his wife had been the first time he ever saw her. As he walked in the garden there was always a pigeon which followed him about. It flew about his head in a way that annoyed him so one day when his wife was sick and asked for a pigeon to be roasted for her dinner he commanded that this particular pigeon should be killed.When the cook was preparing the pigeon for her mistress to eat for dinner she noticed a black speck on the pigeon s breast. She thought that it was a speck of dirt and tried to brush it away. To her surprise she could not brush it off easily because it was a pin firmly embedded in the pigeons breast. She pulled and pulled but could not pull it out so she sent for her master to come and see what he could do to remove it. He at once pulled out the pin and then a wonderful thing happened. The pigeon was transformed into a beautiful maiden. He at once recognised her as the same lovely maiden who had sprung forth from his melon by the fountain and whom he had left hidden in the tree.When the young mans black wife learned that her husband had found the beautiful maiden again after all these years she confessed her deceit and soon died. The young man married the beautiful maiden who was still just as beautiful as she was the first time he saw her. They were very happy together but the wife never forgot about the time she had been a pigeon.Up to that time pigeons had been wild birds who built their nests in the deep forest. The wife often wished that they would build their nests in her beautiful garden so she had little bird houses built and set up there.One day a pigeon bolder than the rest flew through the garden and spied the little bird houses. He moved his family there at once and told the other pigeons that there were other houses there for them too. The other pigeons were timid and so they waited to see what terrible calamity might happen to the bold pigeon and his family but not a single unpleasant thing occurred. They were just as happy as happy could be in their new home.After a while other pigeon families moved into the garden and were happy too. Thus it came about that after years and years the pigeons no longer build their nests in the deep forest but they always make their homes near the homes of men. The pigeons themselves do not know how it all came about but the beautiful woman who was once a pigeon when she had children of her own told them about it and they told their children. Thus it happens that the mothers in Brazil tell their children this story about the pigeon.
We have just taken a little journey and already we want to take a longer one. Whither To Sparta to Mycene to Delphi There are a hundred places at whose names the heart beats with the desire of travel. On horseback we go up the mountain paths through brake and through brier. A single traveller makes an appearance like a whole caravan. He rides forward with his guide a packhorse carries trunks a tent and provisions and a few armed soldiers follow as a guard. No inn with warm beds awaits him at the end of his tiring days journey the tent is often his dwellingplace. In the great wild region the guide cooks him a pillan of rice fowls and curry for his supper. A thousand gnats swarm round the tent. It is a boisterous night and tomorrow the way will lead across swollen streams take care you are not washed awayWhat is your reward for undergoing these hardships The fullest richest reward. Nature manifests herself here in all her greatness every spot is historical and the eye and the thoughts are alike delighted. The poet may sing it the painter portray it in rich pictures but the air of reality which sinks deep into the soul of the spectator and remains there neither painter nor poet can produce.In many little sketches I have endeavoured to give an idea of a small part of Athens and its environs but how colourless the picture seems How little does it exhibit Greece the mourning genius of beauty whose greatness and whose sorrow the stranger never forgetsThe lonely herdsman yonder on the hills would perhaps by a simple recital of an event in his life better enlighten the stranger who wishes in a few features to behold the land of the Hellenes than any picture could do.Then says my Muse let him speak. A custom a good peculiar custom shall be the subject of the mountain shepherds tale. It is calledOur rude house was put together of clay but the doorposts were columns of fluted marble found near the spot where the house was erected. The roof reached almost down to the ground. It was now dark brown and ugly but it had originally consisted of blooming olive and fresh laurel branches brought from beyond the mountain. Around our dwelling was a narrow gorge whose walls of rock rose steeply upwards and showed naked and black and round their summits often hung clouds like white living figures. Never did I hear a singing bird there never did the men there dance to the sound of the bagpipe but the spot was sacred from the old times even its name reminded of this for it was called Delphi The dark solemn mountains were all covered with snow the highest which gleamed the longest in the red light of evening was Parnassus the brook which rolled from it near our house was once sacred also. Now the ass sullies it with its feet but the stream rolls on and on and becomes clear again. How I can remember every spot in the deep holy solitude In the midst of the hut a fire was kindled and when the hot ashes lay there red and glowing the bread was baked in them. When the snow was piled so high around our hut as almost to hide it my mother appeared most cheerful then she would hold my head between her hands and sing the songs she never sang at other times for the Turks our masters would not allow it. She sangAnd when my mother sang thus her eyes became moist and on the long eyelashes hung a tear but she hid it and baked our black bread in the ashes. Then I would clench my fist and cry We will kill the Turks but she repeated from the song the words I will drive them across the islands into the deep sea. But before evening sank down the roebuck was slain and before the night came the stag was hunted and dead.For several days and nights we had been lonely in our hut when my father came home. I knew he would bring me shells from the Gulf of Lepanto or perhaps even a bright gleaming knife. This time he brought us a child a little halfnaked girl that he brought under his sheepskin cloak. It was wrapped in a fur and all that the little creature possessed when this was taken off and she lay in my mothers lap were three silver coins fastened in her dark hair. My father told us that the Turks had killed the childs parents and he told so much about them that I dreamed of the Turks all night. He himself had been wounded and my mother bound up his arm. The wound was deep and the thick sheepskin was stiff with frozen blood. The little maiden was to be my sister. How radiantly beautiful she looked Even my mothers eyes were not more gentle than hers. Anastasia as she was called was to be my sister because her father had been united to mine by the old custom which we still keep. They had sworn brotherhood in their youth and chosen the most beautiful and virtuous girl in the neighbourhood to consecrate their bond of friendship. I often heard of the strange good custom.So now the little girl was my sister. She sat in my lap and I brought her flowers and the feathers of the mountain birds we drank together of the waters of Parnassus and dwelt together for many a year under the laurel roof of the hut while my mother sang winter after winter of the stag who wept red tears. But as yet I did not understand that it was my own countrymen whose many sorrows were mirrored in those tears.One day there came three Frankish men. Their dress was different from ours. They had tents and beds with them on their horses and more than twenty Turks all armed with swords and muskets accompanied them for they were friends of the pacha and had letters from him commanding an escort for them. They only came to see our mountains to ascend Parnassus amid the snow and the clouds and to look at the strange black steep rock near our hut. They could not find room in it nor could they endure the smoke that rolled along the ceiling and found its way out at the low door therefore they pitched their tents on the small space outside our dwelling roasted lambs and birds and poured out strong sweet wine of which the Turks were not allowed to partake.When they departed I accompanied them for some distance carrying my little sister Anastasia wrapped in a goatskin on my back. One of the Frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a rock and drew me and her too as we stood there so that we looked like one creature. I never thought of it but Anastasia and I were really one. She was always sitting in my lap or riding in the goatskin at my back and when I dreamed she appeared in my dreams.Two nights afterwards other men armed with knives and muskets came into our tent. They were Albanians brave men my mother told me. They only stayed a short time. My sister Anastasia sat on the knee of one of them and when they were gone she had not three but only two silver coins in her hair. They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper and smoked it. I remember they were undecided as to the road they were to take.But they had to make a choice. They went and my father went with them. Soon afterwards we heard the sound of firing. The noise was renewed and soldiers rushed into our hut and took my mother and myself and my sister Anastasia prisoners. They declared that the robbers had been entertained by us and that my father had acted as the robbers guide and therefore we must go with them. Presently I saw the corpses of the robbers brought in I saw my fathers corpse too. I cried and cried till I fell asleep. When I awoke we were in prison but the room was not worse than ours in our own house. They gave me onions to eat and musty wine poured from a tarry cask but we had no better fare at home.How long we were kept prisoners I do not know but many days and nights went by. When we were set free it was the time of the holy Easter feast. I carried Anastasia on my back for my mother was ill and could only move slowly and it was a long way till we came down to the sea to the Gulf of Lepanto. We went into a church that gleamed with pictures painted on a golden ground. They were pictures of angels and very beautiful but it seemed to me that our little Anastasia was just as beautiful. In the middle of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses. The Lord Christ is pictured there in the form of a beautiful rose said my mother and the priest announced Christ is risen All the people kissed each other each one had a burning taper in his hand and I received one myself and so did little Anastasia. The bagpipes sounded men danced hand in hand from the church and outside the women were roasting the Easter lamb. We were invited to partake and I sat by the fire a boy older than myself put his arms round my neck kissed me and said Christ is risen and thus it was that for the first time I met Aphtanides.My mother could make fishermens nets for which there was a good demand here in the bay and we lived a long time by the side of the sea the beautiful sea that tasted like tears and in its colours reminded me of the song of the stag that weptfor sometimes its waters were red and sometimes green or blue.The summer came. The sun burned so hot that the leaves turned yellow on the trees. I thought of our cool mountains and of the fresh water they contained my mother too longed for them and one evening we wandered home. What peace what silence We walked on through the thick thyme still fragrant though the sun had scorched its leaves. Not a single herdsman did we meet not one solitary hut did we pass. Everything was quiet and deserted but a shooting star announced that in heaven there was yet life. I know not if the clear blue air gleamed with light of its own or if the radiance came from the stars but we could see the outlines of the mountains quite plainly. My mother lighted a fire roasted some roots she had brought with her and I and my little sister slept among the thyme without fear of the ugly Smidraki from whose throat fire spurts forth or of the wolf and jackal for my mother sat beside us and I considered her presence protection enough for us.We reached our old home but the hut was a heap of ruins and a new one had to be built. A few women lent my mother their aid and in a few days walls were raised and covered with a new roof of olive branches.My mother made many bottle cases of bark and skins I kept the little flock of the priests and Anastasia and the little tortoises were my playmates.Once we had a visit from our beloved Aphtanides who said he had greatly longed to see us and who stayed with us two whole happy days.I have seen a bud on a rosebush gradually unfold in days and weeks till it became a rose and hung there in its beauty before I was aware how large and beautiful and red it had become and the same thing I now saw in Anastasia. She was now a beautiful grown girl and I had become a stout stripling. The wolfskins that covered my mothers and Anastasias bed I had myself taken from wolves that had fallen beneath my shots.Years had gone by when one evening Aphtanides came in slender as a reed strong and brown. He kissed us all and had much to tell of the fortifications of Malta of the great ocean and of the marvellous sepulchres of Egypt. It sounded strange as a legend of the priests and I looked up to him with a kind of veneration.How much you know I exclaimed what wonders you can tell ofBut you have told me the finest thing after all he replied. You told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughtsof the good old custom of the bond of friendship a custom I should like to follow. Brother let you and I go to church as your father and Anastasias went before us your sister Anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of girls she shall consecrate us No people has such grand old customs as we Greeks.Anastasia blushed like a young rose and my mother kissed Aphtanides.A couple of miles from our house there where loose earth lies on the hill and a few scattered trees give a shelter stood the little church a silver lamp hung in front of the altar.I had put on my best clothes the white fustanella fell in rich folds around my hips the red jacket fitted tight and close the tassel on my fez cap was silver and in my girdle gleamed a knife and my pistols. Aphtanides was clad in the blue garb worn by Greek sailors on his chest hung a silver plate with the figure of the Virgin Mary his scarf was as costly as those worn by rich lords. Every one could see that we were about to go through a solemn ceremony. We stepped into the little simple church where the evening sunlight streaming through the door gleamed on the burning lamp and the pictures on golden ground. We knelt down on the altar steps and Anastasia came before us. A long white garment hung loose over her graceful form on her white neck and bosom hung a chain covered with old and new coins forming a kind of collar. Her black hair was fastened in a knot and confined by a headdress made of silver and gold coins that had been found in an old temple. No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than she. Her countenance glowed and her eyes were like two stars.We all three prayed silently and then she said to us Will you be friends in life and in death Yes we replied. Will you whatever may happen remember thismy brother is a part of myself. My secret is his my happiness is his. Selfsacrifice patienceeverything in me belongs to him as to me And we again answered Yes.Then she joined our hands and kissed us on the forehead and we again prayed silently. Then the priest came through the door near the altar and blessed us all three and a song sung by the other holy men sounded from behind the altar screen and the bond of eternal friendship was concluded. When we rose I saw my mother standing by the church door weeping heartily.How cheerful it was now in our little hut and by the springs of Delphi On the evening before his departure Aphtanides sat thoughtful with me on the declivity of a mountain his arm was flung round my waist and mine was round his neck we spoke of the sorrows of Greece and of the men whom the country could trust. Every thought of our souls lay clear before each of us and I seized his hand.One thing thou must still know one thing that till now has been a secret between myself and Heaven. My whole soul is filled with love with a love stronger than the love I bear to my mother and to theeAnd whom do you love asked Aphtanides and his face and neck grew red as fire.I love Anastasia I repliedand his hand trembled in mine and he became pale as a corpse. I saw it I understood the cause and I believe my hand trembled. I bent towards him kissed his forehead and whispered I have never spoken of it to her and perhaps she does not love me. Brother think of this I have seen her daily she has grown up beside me and has become a part of my soulAnd she shall be thine he exclaimed thine I may not deceive thee nor will I do so. I also love her but tomorrow I depart. In a year we shall see each other once more and then you will be married will you not I have a little gold of my own it shall be thine. Thou must thou shalt take it.And we wandered home silently across the mountains. It was late in the evening when we stood at my mothers door.Anastasia held the lamp upwards as we entered my mother was not there. She gazed at Aphtanides with a beautifully mournful gaze. Tomorrow you are going from us she said I am very sorry for it.Sorry he repeated and in his voice there seemed a trouble as great as the grief I myself felt. I could not speak but he seized her hand and said Our brother yonder loves you and he is dear to you is he not His very silence is a proof of his affection.Anastasia trembled and burst into tears. Then I saw no one but her thought of none but her and threw my arms round her and said I love thee She pressed her lips to mine and flung her arms round my neck but the lamp had fallen to the ground and all was dark around usdark as in the heart of poor Aphtanides.Before daybreak he rose kissed us all said farewell and went away. He had given all his money to my mother for us. Anastasia was my betrothed and a few days afterwards she became my wife.
The soldier served God and the Great Tzar for twentyfive years earned three dry biscuits and set off to walk his way home. He kissed his companions with whom he had served so long and boasted of the feasting there would be in the village when he should come marching home with all his wars behind him. Singing at the top of his voice he was as he set off. But as soon as he was alone on the high road walking through the forest he began to think things over. And he thought to himself All these years I have served the Tzar and had good clothes to my back and my belly full of victuals. And now I am like to be both hungry and cold. Already Ive nothing but three dry biscuits.Just then he met an old beggar who stood in the road and crossed himself and asked alms for the love of God.The soldier had not a copper piece in the world so he gave the beggar one of his three dry biscuits.He had not gone very far along the road when he met a second beggar who leant on a stick and recited holy words and begged alms for the love of God.The soldier gave him the second of his three dry biscuits.And then at a bend in the road he met a third old beggar with long white hair and beard and loathsome rags who stood shaking by the the roadside and he begged alms for the love of God.If I give him my last dry biscuit I shall have nothing left for myself thought the soldier. He gave the old beggar half of the third dry biscuit. Then the thought came into his head that perhaps this old beggar would meet the other two and would learn that they had been given whole biscuits while he had only been given a half. He will be hurt and affronted thought the soldier and his blessing will be of no avail. So he gave the old beggar the other half also of the third of his three dry biscuits. I shall get along somehow thought the soldier and was for making forward on his way. But the old beggar put out his hand and stopped him.Brother says the old beggar are you in want of anythingGod bless you says the soldier looking at the beggars rags I want nothing from you. Youre a poor man yourself.Never mind my poverty says the old beggar. Just tell me what you would like to have and I am well able to reward you for your kind heart.I dont want anything said the soldier but if you do happen to have such a thing as a pack of cards about you Id keep them in memory of you and theyd be a pleasure to me on the long road.The old beggar thrust his hand into his bosom among his rags and pulled out a pack of cards.Take these says he and when you play with them youll always be winner whoever may be playing against you. And heres a flour sack for you as well. If you meet anything and want to catch it just open the sack and tell beasts or birds or aught else to get into it and theyll do just that and you can close the sack and do with them what you will.Thank you kindly says the soldier throws the sack over his shoulder puts the pack of cards in his pocket and trudges off along the high road singing an old song.He went on and on till he came to a lake where he drank a little water to ease his thirst and smoked a pipe to put off his hunger resting by the shore of the lake. And there on the lake he saw three wild geese swimming far away. Now if I could catch them thought the soldier and remembered the sack the old beggar had given him. He opened the sack and shouted at the top of his voice Hi You there you wild geese come into my sackAnd the three wild geese splashed up out of the water and flew to the bank and crowded into the sack one after the other.The soldier tied up the mouth of the sack flung it over his shoulder and went on his way.He came to a town and looked for a tavern and chose the best he could see and went in there and asked for the landlord.See here says he here are three wild geese. I want one of them roasted for my dinner. Another Ill give you in exchange for a bottle of vodka. The third you shall have to pay you for your trouble.The landlord agreed as well he might and presently the soldier was seated at a good table near a window with a whole bottle of the best vodka and a fine roast goose fresh from the kitchen.When he had made an end of the goose the soldier laid down his knife and fork tipped the last drops of the vodka down his throat and set the bottle upside down upon the table. Then he lit his little pipe sat back on the bench and took a look out of the window to see what was doing in the town.And there on the other side of the road was a fine palace well carved and painted. A years work had gone to the carving of every doorpost and windowframe. But in all the palace there was not one whole pane of glass.Landlord says the soldier tell me whats the meaning of this Why is a fine palace like that standing empty with broken windowsIts a good enough palace says the landlord. The Tzar built the palace for himself but theres no living in it because of the devils.Devils says the soldier.Devils says the landlord. Every night they crowd into the palace and what with their shouting and yelling and screaming and playing cards and all the other devilries that come into their heads theres no living in the palace for decent folk.And does nobody clear them out asks the soldier.Easier said than done says the landlord.Well with that the soldier wishes good health to the landlord and sets off to see the Tzar. He comes walking into the Tzars house and gives him a salute.Your Majesty says he will you give me leave to spend one night in your empty palaceGod bless you says the Tzar but you dont know what you are asking. Foolhardy folk enough have tried to spend a night in that palace. They went in merry and boasting but not one of them came walking out alive in the morning.What of that says the soldier. Water wont drown a Russian soldier and fire wont burn him. I have served God and the Tzar for twentyfive years and am not dead. A single night in that palace wont be end of me.But I tell you a man walks in there alive in the evening and in the morning the servants have to search the floor for the little bits of his bones.None the less says the soldier if your majesty will give me leave.Get along with you and God be with you says the Tzar. Spend the night there if youve set your heart on it.So the soldier came to the palace and stepped in singing through the empty rooms. He made himself comfortable in the biggest room of all laid his knapsack in a corner and hung his sword on nail sat down at the table took out his bag of tobacco filled his little pipe and sat there smoking ready for what might come.Twelve oclock sharp and there was a yelling a shouting a blowing of horns a scraping of fiddles and every other kind of instrument a noise of dancing of running of stamping and the palace cram full of devils making themselves at home as if the place belonged to them.And you soldier cried the devils. What are you sitting there so glum for smoking your pipe Theres smoke enough where we have been. Put your pipe in your pocket and play a round of cards with us.Right you are says the soldier if youll play with my cards.Deal them out shouted the devils and the soldier put his pipe in his pocket and dealt out the cards while the devils crowded round the table fighting for room on the benches.They played a game and the soldier won. They played another and he won again. The devils were cunning enough God knows but not all their cunning could win a single game for them. The soldier was raking in the money all the time. Soon enough the devils had not a penny piece between them and the soldier was for putting up his cards and lighting his pipe. Content he was and well he might be with his pockets bulging with money.Stop a minute soldier said the devils weve still got sixty bushels of silver and forty of gold.Well play for them if youll give us time to send for them.Lets see the silver says the soldier and puts the cards in his pocket.Well they sent a little devil to fetch the silver. Sixty times he ran out of the room and sixty times he came staggering back with a bushel of silver on his shoulders.The soldier pulled out his cards and they played on but it was all the same. The devils cheated in every kind of way but could not win a game.Go and fetch the gold says the oldest devil.Aye aye grandfather says the little devil and goes scuttling out of the room. Forty times he ran out and forty times he came staggering back with a bushel of gold between his shoulders.They played on. The soldier won every game and all the gold asked if they had any more money to lose put his cards in his pocket and lit his pipe.The devils looked at all the money they had lost. It seemed a pity to lose all that good silver and gold.Tear him to pieces brothers they cried tear him to pieces eat him and have doneThe soldier tapped his little pipe on the table.First make sure says he who eats whom. And with that he whips out his sack and says he to the devils who were all gnashing their teeth and making ready to fall on him what do you call thisIts a sack said the devils.Is it says the soldier. Then by the word of God get into itAnd the next minute all those devils were tumbling over each other and getting into the sack squeezing in one on the top of another until the last one had got inside. Then the soldier tied up the sack with a good double knot hung it on a nail and lay down to sleep.In the morning the Tzar sent his servants.Go says the Tzar and see what has happened to the soldier who spent the night in the empty palace. If the unclean spirits have made an end of him then you must sweep up his bones and make all clean.The servants came all ready to lament for the brave soldier done to death by the unclean and there was the soldier walking cheerfully from one room to another smoking his little pipe.Well done soldier We never thought to see you alive. And how did you spend the night How did you manage against the devilsDevils says the soldier. I wish all men I have played cards against had paid their debts so honestly. Have a look at the silver and gold I won from them. Look at the heaps of money lying on the floor.The servants looked at the silver and gold and touched it to see if it was real. But there was no doubt about that. I wish I had more in my pocket of the same sort.Now brothers said the soldier off with you as quick as you can go and fetch two blacksmiths here on the run. And let them bring with them an iron anvil and the two heaviest hammers in the forge.The servants asked no questions but hurried to the smithy and the two blacksmiths came running with anvil and hammers. Giants they were the strongest men in all the town.Now says the soldier take that sack from the nail and lay it on the anvil and let me see how the blacksmiths of this town can set about their work.The blacksmiths took the sack from the nail.Devil take it what a weight they said to each other.And little voices screamed out of the sack We are good folk. We are your own people.Are you said the blacksmiths and they laid the sack on the anvil and swung the great hammers up and down up and down as if they were beating out a lump of iron.The devils fared badly in there and worse and worse. The hammers came down as if they were going through devils anvil earth and all. It was more than even devils could bear.Have mercy they screamed. Have mercy soldier Let us out again into the world and well never forget you world without end. And as for this palace. No devil shall put the nail of the toe of his foot in it. Well tell them all. Not one shall come within a hundred miles.The soldier let the blacksmiths give a few more blows just for luck. Then he stopped them and untied the mouth of the sack. The moment he opened it the devils shot out and fled away to hell without looking right or left in their hurry.But the soldier was no fool and he grabbed one old devil by the leg. And the devil hung gibbering trying to get away. The soldier cut the devils hairy wrist to the bone so that the blood flowed took a pen dipped it in the blood and gave it to the devil. But he never let go of his leg.Write says he that you will be my faithful servant.The old devil screamed and wriggled but the soldier gripped him tight. There was nothing to be done. He wrote and signed in his own blood a promise to serve the soldier faithfully wherever and whenever there should be need. Then the soldier let him go and he went hopping and screaming after the others and had disappeared in a moment.And so the devils went rushing down to hell aching in every bone of their hairy bodies. And they called all the other unclean spirits old and young big and little and told what had happened to them. And they set sentinels all round hell and guards at every gate and ordered them to watch well and whatever they did not on any account to let in the soldier with the flour sack.The soldier went to the Tzar and told him how he had dealt with the devils and how henceforth no devil would set foot within a hundred miles of the palace.If thats so says the Tzar well move at once and go and live there and you shall live with me and be honoured as my own brother. And with that there was a great to do shifting the bedding and tables and benches and all else from the old palace to the new and the soldier set up house with the Tzar living with him as his own brother and wearing fine clothes with gold embroidery and eating the same food as the Tzar and as much of it as he liked. Money to spend he had for he had won from the devils enough to last even a spending man a thousand years. And he had nothing to spend it on. Hens dont eat gold. No more do mice. And there the money lay in a corner till the soldier was tired of looking at it.So the soldier thought he would marry. And he took a wife and in a years time God gave him a son and he had nothing more to wish for except to see the son grow up and turn into a general.But it so happened that the little boy fell ill and what was the matter with him no one knew. He grew worse and worse from day to day and the Tzar sent for every doctor in the country but not one of them did him a halfpennyworth of good. The doctors grew richer and the boy grew no better but worse as is often the way.The soldier had almost given up hope of saving his son when he remembered the old devil who had signed a promise written in his own blood to serve the soldier faithfully wherever and whenever there should be need. He remembered this and said to himself Where the devil has my old devil hidden himself all this timeAnd he had scarcely said this when suddenly there was the little old devil standing in front of him dressed like a peasant in a little shirt and breeches trembling with fright and asking How can I serve your ExcellencySee here says the soldier. My son is ill. Do you happen to know how to cure himThe little old devil took a glass from his pocket and filled it with cold water and set it on the sick childs forehead.Come here your Excellency says he and look into the glass of water.The soldier came and looked in the glass.And what does your Excellency see asked the little old devil who was so much afraid of the soldier that he trembled and could hardly speak.I see Death like a little old woman standing at my sons feet.Be easy says the little old devil for if Death is standing at your sons feet he will be well again. But if Death were standing at his head then nothing could save him.And with that the little old devil lifted the glass and splashed the cold water over the sick child and the next minute there was the little boy crawling about and laughing and crowing as if he had never been sick in his life.Give me that glass says the soldier and well cry quits.The little old devil gave him the glass. And the soldier gave back the promise which the devil had signed in his own blood. As soon as the little old devil had that promise in his hand he gave one look at the soldier and fled away as if the blacksmiths had only that minute stopped beating him on the anvil.And the soldier after that set up as a wise man and put all the doctors out of business curing the boyars and generals. He would just look in his glass and if Death stood at a sick mans feet he threw the water over him and cured him. If Death stood at the sick mans head he said Its all up with you and the sick man died as sure as fate.All went well until the Tzar himself fell ill and sent for the soldier to cure him.The soldier went in and the Tzar greeted him as his own brother and prayed him to be quick as he felt the sickness growing upon him as he lay. The soldier poured cold water in the glass and set it on the Tzars forehead and looked and looked again and saw Death standing at the Tzars head.O Tzar says the soldier its all up with you. Death is waiting by your head and you have but a few minutes left to live.What cries the Tzar you cure my boyars and generals and you will not cure me who am Tzar and have treated you as my own born brother. If Ive only a few minutes to live Ive time enough to give orders for you to be beheaded.The soldier thought and thought and he begged Death O Death says he give my life to the Tzar and kill me instead. Better to die so than to end by being shamefully beheadedHe looked once more in the glass and saw that the little old woman Death had shifted from the Tzars head and was now standing at his feet. He picked up the glass and splashed the water over the Tzar and there was the Tzar as well and healthy as ever he had been.You are my own true brother after all says the Tzar. Let us go and feast together.But the soldier shook in all his limbs and could hardly stand and he knew that his time was come. He prayed Death O Death give me just one hour to say goodbye to my wife and my little son.Hurry up says Death.And the soldier hurried to his room in the palace said goodbye to his wife told his son to grow up and be a general lay down on his bed and grew iller every minute.He looked and there was Death a little old woman standing by his bedside.Well soldier says Death you have only two minutes left to liveThe soldier groaned and turning in bed pulled the flour sack from under his pillow and opened it.Do you know what this is says he to Death.A sack says Death.Well if it is a sack get into it says the soldier.Death was into the sack in a moment and the soldier leapt from his bed well and strong tied up the sack with two double knots flung it over his shoulder and set out for the deep forest of Brian which is the thickest in all the world. He came to the forest and made his way into the middle of it hung the sack from the topmost branches of a high poplar tree left it there and came home singing songs at the top of his voice and full of all kinds of merriment.From that time on there was no dying in the world. There were births every day and plenty of them but nobody died. It was a poor time for doctors. And so it was for many years. Death had come to an end and it was as if all men would live for ever. And all the time the little old woman Death tied up in a sack unable to get about her business was hanging from the top of a tall poplar tree away in Brian forest.And then one day the soldier was walking out to take the air and he met an ancient old crone so old and so ancient that she was like to fall whichever way the wind blew. She tottered along blown this way and that like a blade of withered grass.What an old hag said the soldier to himself. It was time for her to die a many years ago.Yes says the old crone with her toothless gums numbling and grumbling over her words. Long ago it was time for me to die. When you shut up Death in the sack I had only an hour left to live. I had done with the world and the world had done with me and I would have been glad to be at peace. Long ago my place in heaven was made ready and it is empty to this day for I cannot die. You soldier have sinned before God and before man. You have sinned a sin that God will not forgive. I am not the only soul in the world who is tortured as I am. Mine is not the only place that is growing dusty in heaven. Hundreds and thousands of us who should have died drag on in misery about the world. And but for you we should now be resting in peace.The soldier began to think. And he thought of all the other old men and women he had kept from the rest that God had made ready for them. There is no doubt about it thinks he I had better let Death loose again. No matter if I am the first of whom she makes an end. I have sinned many sins not counting this one. Better go to the other world now and bear my punishment while I am strong for when I am very old it will come worse to me to be tortured.So he set off to the forest of Brian which is the thickest in all the world. He found the poplar tree and saw the sack hanging from the topmost branches swinging this way and that as wind blew.Well Death are you alive up there the soldier shouted against the wind.And a little voice hardly to be heard answered from the sack Alive little fatherSo the soldier climbed up the tree took down the sack and carried it home over his shoulder. He said goodbye to his wife and his son who was now a fine young lad. Then he went into his own room opened the bag lay down upon the bed and begged Death to make an end of him.And Death in the form of a little old woman crept trembling out of the sack looking this way and that for she was very much afraid. As soon as she saw the soldier she bolted through the door and ran away as fast as her little old legs could carry her. The decould carry her. The devils can make an end of you if they like she shrieked but you dont catch me taking a hand in it.The soldier sat up on the bed and knew that he was alive and well. Troubled he was as to what to do next. Thinks he Id better get straight along to hell and let the devils throw me into the boiling pitch and stew me until all my sins are stewed out of me.So he said goodbye to everybody took his sack in his hands and set off to hell by the best road he could find.Well he walked on and on over hill and valley and through the deep forest until he came at last to the kingdom of the unclean. There were the walls of hell and the gates of hell and as he looked he saw that sentinels were standing at every gate.As soon as he came near a gate the devil doing sentry go calls outWho goes thereA sinful soul come to you to be stewed in the boiling pitch.And what is that youve got in your handAnd the devil yelled out at the top of his voice and gave the alarm. From all sides the unclean rushed up and began closing every gate and window in hell with strong bolts and bars.And the soldier walked round hell outside the walls unable to get in.He cried out to the Prince of HellLet me into hell I beg you. I have come to you to be tormented because I have sinned before God and before man.No shouted the Prince of Hell I wont let you in. Go away. Go away I tell you. Go away anywhere you like. Theres no place for you here.The soldier was more troubled than ever.Well says he if you wont let me in you wont. Ill go away if you will give me two hundred sinful souls. I will take them to God and perhaps when he sees them he will forgive me and let me into heaven.Ill throw in another fifty says the Prince of Hell if only youll get away from here.And he told the lesser devils to count out two hundred and fifty sinful souls and to let them out quickly at one of the back doors of hell while he held the soldier in talk so that the soldier should not slip in while the sinful souls were going out.It was done and the soldier set off for heaven with two hundred and fifty sinful souls behind him marching in column of route as the soldier made them for the sake of order and decency.Well they marched on and on and in the end they came to heaven and stopped before the very gates of Paradise.And the holy apostles standing in the gateway of Paradise said Who are youI am the soldier who hung Death in a sack and I have brought two hundred and fifty sinful souls from hell in hope that God will pardon my sins and let me into Paradise.And the apostles went to the Lord and told him that the soldier had come and brought with him two hundred and fifty sinful souls.And God said Let in the sinful souls but do not let in the soldier.The apostles went back to the gateway and opened the gates and told the souls they might come in. But when the soldier tried to march in at the head of his company they stopped him and said No soldier Theres no place for you here.So the soldier took one of the sinful souls aside and gave that soul his sack and told him As soon as you are through the gates of Paradise open the sack and shout out Into the sack soldier You will do this because I brought you here from hell.And the sinful soul promised to do this for the soldier.But when that sinful soul went through the gates into Paradise for very joy it forgot about the soldier and threw away the sack somewhere in Paradise where it may be lying to this day.And so the soldier after waiting a long time went slowly back to earth. Death would not take him. There was no place for him in Paradise and no place for him in Hell. For all I know he may be living yet.
Ansa was King of Calabar for fifty years. He had a very faithful cat as a housekeeper and a rat was his houseboy. The king was an obstinate headstrong man but was very fond of the cat who had been in his store for many years.The rat who was very poor fell in love with one of the kings servant girls but was unable to give her any presents as he had no money.At last he thought of the kings store so in the nighttime being quite small he had little difficulty having made a hole in the roof in getting into the store. He then stole corn and native pears and presented them to his sweetheart.At the end of the month when the cat had to render her account of the things in the store to the king it was found that a lot of corn and native pears were missing. The king was very angry at this and asked the cat for an explanation. But the cat could not account for the loss until one of her friends told her that the rat had been stealing the corn and giving it to the girl.When the cat told the king he called the girl before him and had her flogged. The rat he handed over to the cat to deal with and dismissed them both from his service. The cat was so angry at this that she killed and ate the rat and ever since that time whenever a cat sees a rat she kills and eats it.
Mother I have seen such a wonderful man said a little boy one day as he entered a hut in Lapland bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather.Have you my son and what was he like asked the mother as she took off the childs sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep.Well I was tired of stooping for the sticks and was leaning against a tree to rest when I heard a noise of shsh among the dead leaves. I thought perhaps it was a wolf so I stood very still. But soon there came past a tall manoh twice as tall as fatherwith a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle from which hung a silverhandled knife. Behind him followed a great dog which looked stronger than any wolf or even a bear. But why are you so pale motherIt was the Stalo replied she her voice trembling Stalo the maneater You did well to hide or you might never had come back. But remember that though he is so tall and strong he is very stupid and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick.Not long after the mother and son had held this talk it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one no one knew whither. The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief to show him where they had passed but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well near which the children used to play. The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen and byandby he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there.And as he watched Pattos youngest daughter ran gaily down the path till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place. She slipped and fell and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo.As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage and he vowed to have his revenge. So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung and putting it on went out into the forest. When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well though he took care to keep his head out of the water.Very soon he heard a shsh of the leaves and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner. At the first glimpse of Pattos head in the well he laughed loudly cryingHa ha This time it is the old ass I wonder how he will taste And drawing Patto out of the well he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home. Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut which he meant to hold Pattos flesh when it was cooked. In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool.The young man looked everywhere but he could not find the axe for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes.Stupid fellow what is the use of you grumbled his father angrily and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool but they had no better success than their brother.I must come myself I suppose said Stalo putting aside the box. But meanwhile Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door so that as Stalo stepped in his prisoner raised the axe and with one blow the ogres head was rolling on the ground. His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away.And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children.But though Stalo was dead his three sons were still living and not very far off either. They had gone to their mother who was tending some reindeer on the pastures and told her that by some magic they knew not what their fathers head had rolled from his body and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her. The ogress said nothing. Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer while she returned to the other house to bury her husbands body.Now three days journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting. Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves the danger seemed too far away.Unluckily however one day when Lyma was left by herself in the hut the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage. The country was very lonely and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her. Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos house.When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty. Loudly they cried Lyma Lyma But no voice answered them and they fell to searching all about lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them. At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow and they set out to follow it.On and on they went and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another days journey would bring them to the Stalos dwelling. Of course they did not dare to approach it openly for the Stalos had the strength of giants and besides there were three of them so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well.Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here they said to each other.But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came and as she let down her bucket into the well the leaves seemed to whisper Lyma LymaThe girl started and looked up but could see nothing and in a moment the voice came again.Be carefultake no notice fill your buckets but listen carefully all the while and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also.So Lyman bent over the well lower than before and seemed busier than ever.You know said her brother that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel but throws it to his dogs. Now after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire and the broth is nearly cooked just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot. The Stalo will soon notice this and will call you to give all the food to the dogs but instead you must bring it straight to us as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk. That is all you need do for the present.Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house and did as her brothers had told her. They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking but when there was nothing left in the pot the eldest one saidListen carefully to what I have to tell you. After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him. You can hear him snoring a mile off and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot. When that is done come to us and we will give you further directions.I will obey you in everything dear brothers answered Lyman and so she did.It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next days dinner. The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing and where the beasts were secured so at midnight when all was still they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together. The animals were frightened and began to neigh and kick as if they were fighting together and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it and that was a thing which had never occurred before. Raising himself in his bed he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves.The young Stalo did as he was bid and left the house but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos and fell without a groan. Then they went back to worry the reindeer and the noise became as great as ever and a second time the Stalo awoke.The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts he cried to his second brother go and help him or I shall never get to sleep. So the brother went and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno. The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet but as the clatter of the reindeers horns was as bad as ever he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himselfIt is extraordinary that they cannot unlock themselves but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it.Rubbing his eyes he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls. The Sodnos heard it below and posted themselves one at the big door and one at the little door at the back for they did not know what their enemy would come out at.The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed where it always lay but the mantle was no there. He wondered where it could be and who could have moved it and after searching through all the rooms he found it hanging over the kitchen fire. But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone and went with nothing except a stick in his hand through the back door.The young Sodno was standing ready for him and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again. The two Sodnos did not trouble about him but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes in which they dressed themselves. Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos mother where the treasure was hidden.With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old womans room. She was already up and dressed and sitting by the window knitting and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor laying his head on her lap. For a while he kept silence then he whispered gentlyTell me dear mother where did my eldest brother conceal his richesWhat a strange question Surely you must know answered she.No I have forgotten my memory is so bad.He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there said she. And there was another pause.Byandby the Sodno asked againAnd where may my second brothers money beDont you know that either cried the mother in surprise.Oh yes I did once. But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing.It is behind the oven answered she. And again was silence.Mother dear mother said the young man at last I am almost afraid to ask you but I really have grown so stupid of late. Where did I hide my own moneyBut at this question the old woman flew into a passion and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him. Luckily no rod was within her reach and the Sodno managed after a little to coax her back into good humour and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting.Dear mother said Lyman who had come in unseen and was kneeling in front of the fire. Dear mother do you know who it is you have been talking withThe old woman started but answered quietlyIt is a Sodno I supposeYou have guessed right replied Lyma.The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane which she always used to kill her victims but it was not there for Lyma had put it in the fire.Where is my iron cane asked the old woman.There answered Lyma pointing to the flames.The old woman sprang forwards and seized it but her clothes caught fire and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes.So the Sodno brothers found the treasure and they carried it and their sister and the reindeer to their own home and were the richest men in all Lapland.
Once upon a time a glazier who was travelling across the mountains feeling very tired from the heavy load of glass which he was carrying began to look about to discover a place where he might rest it. Rubezahl who had been watching for some time no sooner saw this than he changed himself into a little mound which the glazier not long afterwards discovered in his way and on which well pleased he proposed to seat himself. But his joy was not of long continuance for he had not sat there many minutes before the heap vanished from under him so rapidly that the poor glazier fell to the ground with his glass which was by the fall smashed into a thousand pieces.The poor fellow arose from the ground and looked around him but the mound of earth on which he had before seated himself was no longer visible. Then he began bitterly to lament and to sigh with heartfelt sorrow over his untoward fate. At length he started once more on his journey. Upon this Rubezahl assuming the appearance of a traveller accosted him and inquired why he so lamented and what was the great sorrow with which he was afflicted. The glazier related to him the whole affair how that being weary he had seated himself upon a mound by the wayside how this had suddenly overthrown him and broken to pieces his whole stock of glass which was well worth eight dollars and how in short the mound itself had suddenly disappeared. He declared that he knew not in the least how to recover his loss and bring the business to a good ending. The compassionate mountain sprite comforted him told him who he was and that he himself had played him the trick and at the same time bade him be of good cheer for his losses should be made good to him.Upon this Rubezahl transformed himself into an ass and directed the glazier to sell him at the mill which lay at the foot of the mountain and to be sure to make off with the purchasemoney as quickly as possible. The glazier accordingly immediately bestrode the transformed mountain sprite and rode him down the mountain to the mill where he offered him for sale to the miller at the price of ten dollars. The miller offered nine and the glazier without further haggling took the money and went his way.When he was gone the miller sent his newly purchased beast to the stable and the boy who had charge of him immediately filled his rack with hay. Upon this Rubezahl exclaimedI dont eat hay. I eat nothing but roasted and boiled and that of the best.The boys hair stood on end. He flew to his master and related to him this wondrous tale and he no sooner heard it than he hastened to the stable and there found nothing for his ass and his nine dollars were alike vanished.But the miller was rightly served for he had cheated in his time many poor people therefore Rubezahl punished in this manner the injustice of which he had been guilty.In the year 1512 a man of noble family who was a very tyrant and oppressor had commanded one of his vassals or peasants to carry home with his horses and cart an oak of extraordinary magnitude and threatened to visit him with the heaviest disgrace and punishment if he neglected to fulfil his desires. The peasant saw that it was impossible for him to execute the command of his lord and fled to the woods with great sorrow and lamentation.There he was accosted by Rubezahl who appeared to him like a man and inquired of him the cause of his so great sorrow and affliction. Upon this the peasant related to him all the circumstances of the case. When Rubezahl heard it he bade him be of good cheer and care not but go home to his house again as he himself would soon transport the oak as his lord required into his courtyard.Scarcely had the peasant got well home again before Rubezahl took the monstrous oaktree with its thick and sturdy boughs and hurled it into the courtyard of the nobleman and with its huge stem and its many thick branches so choked and blocked up the entrance that no one could get either in or out. And because the oak proved harder than their iron tools and could in no manner or wise and with no power which they could apply to it be hewn or cut in pieces the nobleman was compelled to break through the walls in another part of the courtyard and have a new doorway made which was only done with great labour and expense.Once upon a time Rubezahl made from what materials is not known a quantity of pigs which he drove to the neighbouring market and sold to a peasant with a caution that the purchaser should not drive them through any water.Now what happened Why these same swine having chanced to get sadly covered with mire what must the peasant do but drive them to the river which they had no sooner entered than the pigs suddenly became wisps of straw and were carried away by the stream. The purchaser was moreover obliged to put up with the loss for he could neither find his pigs again nor could he discover the person from whom he had bought them.Rubezahl once betook himself to the Hirschberg which is in the neighbourhood of his forest haunts and there offered his services as a woodcutter to one of the townsmen asking for his remuneration nothing more than a bundle of wood. This the man promised him accepting his offer and pointed out some cartloads intending to give him some assistance. To this offer of help in his labours Rubezahl repliedNo. It is quite unnecessary. All that is to be done I can very well accomplish by myself.Upon this his new master made a few further inquiries asking him what sort of a hatchet he had got for he had noticed that his supposed servant was without one.Oh said Rubezahl Ill soon get a hatchet.Accordingly he laid hands upon his left leg and pulled that and his foot and all off at the thigh and with it cut as if he had been raving mad all the wood into small pieces of proper lengths and sizes in about a quarter of an hour thus proving that a dismembered foot is a thousand times more effectual for such purposes than the sharpest axe.In the meanwhile the owner who saw plainly that mischief was intended kept calling upon the wondrous woodcutter to desist and go about his business. Rubezahl however kept incessantly answeringNo I wont stir from this spot until I have hewn the wood as small as I agreed to and have got my wages for so doing.In the midst of such quarrelling Rubezahl finished his job and screwed his leg on again for while at work he had been standing on one leg after the fashion of a stork. Then he gathered together into one bundle all he had cut placed it on his shoulder and started off with it towards his favourite retreat heedless of the tears and lamentations of his master.On this occasion Rubezahl did not appear in the character of a sportive or mischievous spirit but as an avenger of injustice for his employer had induced a number of poor men to bring wood to his home upon the promise of paying them wages which however he had never paid them. Rubezahl laid at the door of each of these poor men as much of the wood he carried away as would repay them and so the business was brought to a proper termination.It once happened that a messenger vexed or played some trick upon Rubezahl who thereupon revenged himself in the following manner and so wiped out the score.The messenger in one of his journeys over the mountains entered an hotel to refresh himself and placed his spear as usual behind the door. No sooner had he done so than Rubezahl carried off the spear transformed himself into a similar one and took its place.When the messenger after taking his rest set forth again with the spear and had got some little way on his journey it began slipping about every now and then in such a manner that the messenger began pitching forward into the most intolerable mire and got himself sadly bespattered. It did this so often that at last he could not tell for the soul of him what had come to the spear or why he kept slipping forward with it instead of seizing fast hold of the ground.He looked at it longways and sideways from above from underneath but in spite of all his attempts no change could he discover.After this inspection he went forward a little way when suddenly he was once more plunged into the morass and commenced cryingWoe is me woe is me at his spear which led him into such scrapes and did nothing to release him from them. At length he got himself once more to rights and then he turned the spear the wrong way upwards. No sooner had he done so than he was driven backwards instead of forwards and so got into a worse plight than ever.After this he laid the spear across his shoulder like a pikeman since it was no use to trail it upon the earth and in this fashion he started on. But Rubezahl continued his tricks by pressing on the messenger as though he had got a yoke on his back. He changed the spear from one shoulder to the other until at last from very weariness he threw away the bewitched weapon imagining that the Evil One must possess it and went his way without it.He had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile when looking carelessly about him he was astounded to find his spear by his side. He was sadly frightened and little knew what to make of it. At last he boldly ventured to lay hands upon it. He did so and lifted it up but he could not conceive how he should carry it. He had no desire to trail it any more on the ground and the thought of carrying it on his shoulder made him shudder. He decided however to give it another trial carrying it in his hand. Fresh troubles now arose. The spear weighed so heavy that he could not stir it a foot from the spot and though he tried first one hand and then another all his efforts were in vain.At last he bethought him of riding upon the spear as a child bestrides a stick. A wonderful change now came over the weapon. It ran on as though it had been a fleet horse and thus mounted the messenger rode on without ceasing until he descended the mountain and came into the city where he excited the wonder delight and laughter of the worthy burghers.Although he had endured some trouble in the early part of his journey the messenger thought he had been amply compensated at the close and he comforted himself by making up his mind that in all future journeys he was destined to perform he would bestride his nimble spear. His good intentions were however frustrated. Rubezahl had played his game and had had all the amusement he desired with the poor knave. Accordingly he scampered away leaving in his place the real spear which never played any more tricks but after the old fashion of other spears accompanied its master in a becoming and orderly style.A poor woman who got her living by gathering herbs once went accompanied by her two children to the mountains carrying with her a basket in which to gather the plants which she was in the habit of disposing of to the apothecaries. Having chanced to discover a large tract of land covered with such plants as were most esteemed she busied herself so in filling her basket that she lost her way and was troubled to find out how to get back to the path from which she had wandered. On a sudden a man dressed like a peasant appeared before her and saidWell good woman what is it you are looking for so anxiously and where do you want to goAlas replied she I am a poor woman who has neither bit nor sup for which reason I am obliged to wander to gather herbs so that I may buy bread for myself and my hungry children. I have lost my way and cannot find it. I pray you good man take pity on me and lead me out of the thicket into the right path so that I may make the best of my way home.Well my good woman replied Rubezahl for it was he make yourself happy. I will show you the way. But what good are those roots to you They will be of little benefit. Throw away this rubbish and gather from this tree as many leaves as will fill your basket you will find them answer your purpose much better.Alas said the woman who would give a penny for them They are but common leaves and good for nothing.Be advised my good woman said Rubezahl throw away those you have got and follow me.He repeated his injunction over and over again in vain until he got tired for the woman would not be persuaded. At last he fairly laid hold of the basket threw the herbs out by main force and supplied their place with leaves from the surrounding bushes. When he had finished he told the woman to go home and led her into the right path.The woman with her children and her basket journeyed on some distance but they had not gone far before she saw some valuable herbs growing by the wayside. No sooner did she perceive them than she longed to gather them for she hoped that she should obtain something for them while the leaves with which her basket was crammed were she thought good for nothing. She accordingly emptied her basket throwing away the rubbish as she esteemed it and having filled it once more with roots journeyed on to her dwelling at Kirschdorf.As soon as she arrived at her home she cleansed the roots she had gathered from the earth which clung around them tied them neatly together and emptied everything out of the basket. Upon doing this something glittering caught her eye and she commenced to make a careful examination of the basket. She was surprised to discover several ducats sticking to the wickerwork and these were clearly such of the leaves as remained of those which she had so thoughtlessly thrown away on the mountains.She rejoiced at having preserved what she had but she was again sorely vexed that she had not taken care of all that the mountain spirit had gathered for her. She hastened back to the spot where she had emptied the basket in hopes of finding some of the leaves there but her search was in vainthey had all vanished.
Many years ago there lived a little boy whose name was Manoel. His father and mother were so very poor that they could not afford to send him to school. Because he did not go to school he played all day in the fields on the edge of the forest where the giant lived.One day Manoel met the giant. The giant lived all alone in the forest so he was very lonely and wished he had a little boy like Manoel. He loved little Manoel as soon as he saw him and after that they were together every day. The giant taught Manoel all the secrets of the forests and jungles. He taught him all the secrets of the wind and the rain and the thunder and the lightning. He taught him all the secrets of the beasts and the birds and the serpents.Manoel grew up a wise lad indeed. His father and mother were very proud of him and so was his kind teacher the giant.One day the kings messenger rode up and down the kingdom with a message from the kings daughter. The kings daughter the beautiful princess of the land had promised to wed the man who could tell her a riddle she could not guess. All the princes who had sung of love beneath the palace window had been very stupid. The princess wished to marry a man who knew more than she did.When Manoel heard the words of the messenger he said to his father and mother I am going to the palace to tell a riddle to the princess. I am sure I can give her one which she cannot guess.You are an exceedingly clever lad I know my son replied his mother but there will be many princes and handsome cavalheiros at the palace to tell riddles to the princess. What if she will not listen to a lad in shabby clothingI will make the princess listen to my riddle replied Manoel.What riddle are you going to ask the princess asked Manoels father.I do not know yet replied the lad. I will make up a riddle on the way to the palace. I am going to start at once.The kind giant who had been the lads friend gave him his blessing and wished him luck. The lads mother prepared a lunch for him to carry with him. His father sat before the door and boasted to all the neighbours that his son was going to wed the kings daughter. Manoel took his dog with him when he went on his journey because he wanted some one for company.Manoel journeyed on and on through the forests and jungles and after a time he had eaten all the lunch his mother had given him when he went from home. When he became hungry he spent his last vintem for some bread from a little venda in the town he passed through. He went on to the forest to eat the bread and before he tasted of it himself he gave a piece to his dog. The dog died immediately. The bread was poisoned.Even as Manoel stood by weeping for his faithful dog three big black buzzards flew down and devoured the dead beast. They fell dead immediately. Just then the lad heard voices and soon he saw seven horsemen approaching. The men were robbers and though they had much gold in their pockets they had no food. I am hungry enough to eat a dead buzzard said the captain of the robbers. The robbers greedily seized the three buzzards and devoured them at once. The seven men immediately died from the poison.The buzzards stole the body of my dog so they became mine said Manoel. The seven robbers stole my three buzzards so they became mine too. He took all the gold from the pockets of the seven robbers and dressed himself in the garments of the captain of the robbers because they were finest. He mounted the horse of the captain of the robbers because that was the best horse.The lad rode on toward the palace of the king. After a time he became thirsty and pushed the horse into a gallop. The horse became covered with sweat and with the horses sweat he quenched his thirst. Soon he arrived at the royal palace.Dressed in the robbers fine garments and mounted upon the robbers fine horse Manoel had no difficulty in being admitted to the palace. He was taken at once before the princess to tell his riddle.The princess saw in Manoels eyes all the secrets of the forests and jungles which the kind giant had taught him. Here is a youth who will tell me a riddle which will be worth listening to said the princess to herself. All the princes and cavalheiros from all the neighbouring kingdoms had told her such stupid riddles that she had been bored nearly to death. She could always guess the answers even before she had heard the end of the riddle.This is the riddle which Manoel told the princessI went away from home with a pocket fullSoon it became emptyAgain it became full.I went away from home with a companionMy pocketfull killed my companionMy dead companion was the slayer of threeThe three killed seven.From the seven I chose the bestI drank water which did not fall from heaven.And here I standBefore the loveliest princess in the land.The princess listened to the riddle carefully. Then she asked Manoel to say it all over again. The princess thought and thought but she did not have a good guess as to the answer to the riddle.No one in all the palace could understand Manoels riddle. You have won my daughter as your bride said the king after he had used all his royal wits to solve the riddle and could not do it.When Manoel explained his riddle to the princess she said Nossa Senhora herself must have sent you to me. I never could have endured a stupid husband.
It is a great truth that from the same wood are formed the statues of idols and the rafters of gallows kings thrones and cobblers stalls and another strange thing is that from the same rags are made the paper on which the wisdom of sages is recorded and the crown which is placed on the head of a fool. The same too may be said of children one daughter is good and another bad one idle another a good housewife one fair another ugly one spiteful another kind one unfortunate another born to good luck and who being all of one family ought to be of one nature. But leaving this subject to those who know more about it I will merely give you an example in the story of the three daughters of the same mother wherein you will see the difference of manners which brought the wicked daughters into the ditch and the good daughter to the top of the Wheel of Fortune.There was at one time a woman who had three daughters two of whom were so unlucky that nothing ever succeeded with them all their projects went wrong all their hopes were turned to chaff. But the youngest who was named Nella was born to good luck and I verily believe that at her birth all things conspired to bestow on her the best and choicest gifts in their power. The Sky gave her the perfection of its light Venus matchless beauty of form Love the first dart of his power Nature the flower of manners. She never set about any work that it did not go off to a nicety she never took anything in hand that it did not succeed to a hair she never stood up to dance that she did not sit down with applause. On which account she was envied by her jealous sisters and yet not so much as she was loved and wished well to by all others as greatly as her sisters desired to put her underground so much more did other folks carry her on the palms of their hands.Now there was in that country an enchanted Prince who was so attracted by her beauty that he secretly married her. And in order that they might enjoy one anothers company without exciting the suspicion of the mother who was a wicked woman the Prince made a crystal passage which led from the royal palace directly into Nellas apartment although it was eight miles distant. Then he gave her a certain powder saying Every time you wish to see me throw a little of this powder into the fire and instantly I will come through this passage as quick as a bird running along the crystal road to gaze upon this face of silver.Having arranged it thus not a night passed that the Prince did not go in and out backwards and forwards along the crystal passage until at last the sisters who were spying the actions of Nella found out the secret and laid a plan to put a stop to the sport. And in order to cut the thread at once they went and broke the passage here and there so that when the unhappy girl threw the powder into the fire to give the signal to her husband the Prince who used always to come running in furious haste hurt himself in such a manner against the broken crystal that it was truly a pitiable sight to see. And being unable to pass further on he turned back all cut and slashed like a Dutchmans breeches. Then he sent for all the doctors in the town but as the crystal was enchanted the wounds were mortal and no human remedy availed. When the King saw this despairing of his sons condition he sent out a proclamation that whoever would cure the wounds of the Princeif a woman she should have him for a husbandif a man he should have half his kingdom.Now when Nella who was pining away from the loss of the Prince heard this she dyed her face disguised herself and unknown to her sisters she left home to go to see him before his death. But as by this time the Suns gilded ball with which he plays in the Fields of Heaven was running towards the west night overtook her in a wood close to the house of an ogre where in order to get out of the way of danger she climbed up into a tree. Meanwhile the ogre and his wife were sitting at table with the windows open in order to enjoy the fresh air while they ate as soon as they had emptied their cups and put out the lamps they began to chat of one thing and another so that Nella who was as near to them as the mouth to the nose heard every word they spoke.Among other things the ogress said to her husband My pretty HairyHide tell me what news what do they say abroad in the world And he answered Trust me there is no hands breadth clean everythings going topsyturvy and awry. But what is it replied his wife. Why I could tell pretty stories of all the confusion that is going on replied the ogre for one hears things that are enough to drive one mad such as buffoons rewarded with gifts rogues esteemed cowards honoured robbers protected and honest men little thought of. But as these things only vex one I will merely tell you what has befallen the Kings son. He had made a crystal path along which he used to go to visit a pretty lass but by some means or other I know not how all the road has been broken and as he was going along the passage as usual he has wounded himself in such a manner that before he can stop the leak the whole conduit of his life will run out. The King has indeed issued a proclamation with great promises to whoever cures his son but it is all labour lost and the best he can do is quickly to get ready mourning and prepare the funeral.When Nella heard the cause of the Princes illness she sobbed and wept bitterly and said to herself Who is the wicked soul who has broken the passage and caused so much sorrow But as the ogress now went on speaking Nella was as silent as a mouse and listened.And is it possible said the ogress that the world is lost to this poor Prince and that no remedy can be found for his maladyHarkye Granny replied the ogre the doctors are not called upon to find remedies that may pass the bounds of nature. This is not a fever that will yield to medicine and diet much less are these ordinary wounds which require lint and oil for the charm that was on the broken glass produces the same effect as onion juice does on the iron heads of arrows which makes the wound incurable. There is one thing only that could save his life but dont ask me to tell it to you for it is a thing of importance.Do tell me dear old Longtusk cried the ogress tell me if you would not see me die.Well then said the ogre I will tell you provided you promise me not to confide it to any living soul for it would be the ruin of our house and the destruction of our lives.Fear nothing my dear sweet little husband replied the ogress for you shall sooner see pigs with horns apes with tails moles with eyes than a single word shall pass my lips. And so saying she put one hand upon the other and swore to it.You must know then said the ogre that there is nothing under the sky nor above the ground that can save the Prince from the snares of death but our fat. If his wounds are anointed with this his soul will be arrested which is just at the point of leaving the dwelling of his body.Nella who overheard all that passed gave time to Time to let them finish their chat and then getting down from the tree and taking heart she knocked at the ogres door crying Ah my good masters I pray you for charity alms some sign of compassion. Have a little pity on a poor miserable wretched creature who is banished by fate far from her own country and deprived of all human aid who has been overtaken by night in this wood and is dying of cold and hunger. And crying thus she went on knocking and knocking at the door.Upon hearing this deafening noise the ogress was going to throw her half a loaf and send her away. But the ogre who was more greedy of flesh than the squirrel is of nuts the bear of honey the cat of fish the sheep of salt or the ass of bran said to his wife Let the poor creature come in for if she sleeps in the fields who knows but she may be eaten up by some wolf. In short he talked so much that his wife at length opened the door for Nella whilst with all his pretended charity he was all the time reckoning on making four mouthfuls of her. But the glutton counts one way and the host another for the ogre and his wife drank till they were fairly tipsy. When they lay down to sleep Nella took a knife from a cupboard and made a hash of them in a trice. Then she put all the fat into a phial went straight to the court where presenting herself before the King she offered to cure the Prince. At this the King was overjoyed and led her to the chamber of his son and no sooner had she anointed him well with the fat than the wound closed in a moment just as if she had thrown water on the fire and he became sound as a fish.When the King saw this he said to his son This good woman deserves the reward promised by the proclamation and that you should marry her. But the Prince replied It is hopeless for I have no storeroom full of hearts in my body to share among so many my heart is already disposed of and another woman is already the mistress of it. Nella hearing this replied You should no longer think of her who has been the cause of all your misfortune. My misfortune has been brought on me by her sisters replied the Prince and they shall repent it. Then do you really love her said Nella. And the Prince replied More than my own life. Embrace me then said Nella for I am the fire of your heart. But the Prince seeing the dark hue of her face answered I would sooner take you for the coal than the fire so keep offdont blacken me. Whereupon Nella perceiving that he did not know her called for a basin of clean water and washed her face. As soon as the cloud of soot was removed the sun shone forth and the Prince recognising her pressed her to his heart and acknowledged her for his wife. Then he had her sisters thrown into an oven thus proving the truth of the old sayingNo evil ever went without punishment.
Each tribe has its own stories. Most of them deal with the same subjects differing only in immaterial particulars.Instead of squirrels in the timber the Blackfeet are sure they were prairiedogs that OLDman roasted that time when he made the mountainlion long and lean. The Chippewas and Crees insist that they were squirrels that were cooked and eaten but one tribe is essentially a forestpeople and the other lives on the plainshence the difference.Some tribes will not wear the feathers of the owl nor will they have anything to do with that bird while others use his feathers freely.The forest Indian wears the softsoled moccasin while his brother of the plains covers the bottoms of his footwear with rawhide because of the cactus and pricklypear most likely.The door of the lodge of the forest Indian reaches to the ground but the plains Indian makes his lodge skin to reach all about the circle at the bottom because of the wind.One night in War Eagles lodge Otherperson asked Why dont the Bear have a tail grandfatherWar Eagle laughed and said Our people do not know why but we believe he was made that way at the beginning although I have heard men of other tribes say that the Bear lost his tail while fishing.I dont know how true it is but I have been told that a long time ago the Bear was fishing in the winter and the Fox asked him if he had any luck.No replied the Bear I cant catch a fish.Well said the Fox if you will stick your long tail down through this hole in the ice and sit very still I am sure you will catch a fish.So the Bear stuck his tail through the hole in the ice and the Fox told him to sit still till he called him then the Fox went off pretending to hunt along the bank. It was mighty cold weather and the water froze all about the Bears tail yet he sat still waiting for the Fox to call him. Yes the Bear sat so still and so long that his tail was frozen in the ice but he didnt know it. When the Fox thought it was time he calledHey Bear come here quickquick I have a Rabbit in this hole and I want you to help me dig him out. Ho The Bear tried to get up but he couldnt.Hey Bear come herethere are two Rabbits in this hole called the Fox.The Bear pulled so hard to get away from the ice that he broke his tail off short to his body. Then the Fox ran away laughing at the Bear.I hardly believe that story but once I heard an old man who visited my father from the country far east of here tell it. I remembered it. But I cant say that I know it is true as I can the others.When I told you the story of how OLDman made the world over after the water had made its war upon it I told you how the first man and woman were made. There is another story of how the first man found his wife and I will tell you that.After OLDman had made a man to look like himself he left him to live with the Wolves and went away. The man had a hard time of it with no clothes to keep him warm and no wife to help him so he went out looking for OLDman.It took the man a long time to find OLDmans lodge but as soon as he got there he went right in and saidOLDman you have made me and left me to live with the Wolfpeople. I dont like them at all. They give me scraps of meat to eat and wont build a fire. They have wives but I dont want a Wolfwoman. I think you should take better care of me.Well replied OLDman I was just waiting for you to come to see me. I have things fixed for you. You go down this river until you come to a steep hillside. There you will see a lodge. Then I will leave you to do the rest. GoThe man started and travelled all that day. When night came he camped and ate some berries that grew near the river. The next morning he started down the river again looking for the steep hillside and the lodge. Just before sundown the man saw a fine lodge near a steep hillside and he knew that was the lodge he was looking for so he crossed the river and went into the lodge.Sitting by the fire inside was a woman. She was dressed in buckskin clothes and was cooking some meat that smelled good to the man but when she saw him without any clothes she pushed him out of the lodge and dropped the door.Things didnt look very good to that man I tell you but to get even with the woman he went up on the steep hillside and commenced to roll big rocks down upon her lodge. He kept this up until one of the largest rocks knocked down the lodge and the woman ran out crying.When the man heard the woman crying it made him sorry and he ran down the hill to her. She sat down on the ground and the man ran to where she was and saidI am sorry I made you cry woman. I will help you fix your lodge. I will stay with you if you will only let me.That pleased the woman and she showed the man how to fix up the lodge and gather some wood for the fire. Then she let him come inside and eat. Finally she made him some clothes and they got along very well after that.That is how the man found his wifeHo
On a beautiful hill near the river Vistula a company of young countrymen and countrywomen came together to celebrate the harvesthome with music and dancing. There was plenty to eat and drink and they helped themselves freely. In the midst of the merriment a terrible cry was heard which drowned the music and jovial songs.The young people left off dancing ran to the spot whence the cry came and found with horror that an enormous wolf had seized one of the handsomest girls of the village in his mouth and was dragging her away. The most courageous among the youths followed and soon overtook the wolf but the furious monster his mouth foaming with rage having dropped his prey on the ground stood over it ready to fight.The men unarmed and terrified knew not what to do. Some of them ran home to fetch firearms the rest quite unnerved stood aloof and awaited their return. The wolf seeing the fear of those who remained again seized the poor girl and disappeared with her into the adjoining forest.Fifty years had passed away since the occurrence of this terrible scene. Another feast was being held on the same hill and an old greyheaded man approached the merrymakers. The people invited him to join in their revels but he gloomy and reserved sat down to drink the proffered glass of brandy in silence.A peasant of nearly the same age as the guest approached saluted him and tried to engage him in conversation. The stranger after looking at him for some time demanded with emotion Is it you indeed JohnThe countryman then recognised in the stranger his elder brother who had been lost fifty years before. The wondering peasants soon surrounded the old visitor who told them how having been changed into a wolf by a witch he had carried his betrothed away from that same hill during a harvesthome festival how he had lived with her in the forest for a year when she had died.From that moment he continued savage and furious I attacked every one and destroyed everything I fell in with. The blood I then shed I cannot even now wipe away.Here he showed them his hands covered with bloodstains.It is now four years since again changed to human shape I have wandered from place to place. I wished to see you all once moreto see the hut and village where I was born and grew up to be a man. After thatAh woe is me Fly Fly from me I shall become a wolf againAs soon as he had uttered these words he was changed into a wolf. He howled piteously rushed past the astonished peasants and disappeared in the neighbouring forest for ever.A witch having fallen in love with a young peasant tried all her magic arts in vain to make him return her affection. At last offended at his indifference the furious woman resolved to take a terrible revenge.Meeting him once she said When you next go to the forest for wood at the first stroke of your axe you shall be changed into a wolf.The peasant slighting her threats put his oxen to the wagon and drove to the forest. But no sooner had he struck a tree than the axe fell to the ground. Surprised and terrified he looked at his handsthey were changed into wolfs paws Almost maddened with fear and distress he ran about the forest. He looked into a pool of water and saw that he was changed into a wolf only here and there some portion of his clothes remained the transformation not being yet quite complete. He hastened to his oxen but they frightened at the sight of him turned and ran. He tried to stop them by the sound of his once familiar voice but instead of speaking he could only howl. Then alas with pain and terror he fully understood that the threats of the despised witch were carried into effect.Unable in spite of the change to depart from his native place he wandered about in the neighbourhood. In vain he tried to accustom himself to raw meat he could not eat it he had an especial horror of human flesh. In order to obtain food he used to frighten away the shepherds and harvestmen and eat their bread milk and other provisions.Having spent some years in this manner he one day felt an unusual desire to sleep and accordingly laid down in the grass. But what was his surprise when on awakening he perceived that he was again changed into a man. Delighted beyond measure and forgetting that after breaking the spell and changing from the state of a wolf to that of a man people are left without clothes the happy peasant ran swiftly home.Happiness they say does not last long. The truth of this saying the peasant experienced only too soon. On arriving home he found his parents were dead Kate the girl whom he had loved before all others was married and had four children most of his friends were either dead or had removed to distant parts.The unfortunate peasant bore his misfortunes bravely. He tried to forget his troubles by the tillage in the sweat of his brow of a small piece of land. Sometimes especially on holidays he would go to the village publichouse and there surrounded by his neighbours would tell the story of his adventures and the trials he had suffered through the cruel vengeance of the despised witch.A peasant having been a wolf for seven years was permitted by the witch who had transformed him to resume his natural shape. Although hungry and without clothes he walked the whole day to reach his home where he had left his wife and children. He arrived late at night before his hut and knocked at the door.Who is there demanded a voice from within and the peasant at once recognised it as that of his wife.It is Iyour husband open the door quickHeaven help us cried the terrified woman. Here husband get upThe wondering peasant soon saw before him his former servant who having married his wife had come into all his property. The new husband rushed out of the hut armed with a pitchfork determined to drive away its rightful owner. The unhappy manwolf exasperated at his wifes inconstancy cried out in his anguishOh that I were again a wolf that I might punish my faithless wife and never feel my miseryHis wish was gratified on the instant he was changed again into a wolf. Maddened with rage he attacked his wife who stood by holding a child of the second marriage in her arms. He pulled her down to the ground devoured the child and revenged himself upon its mother by mangling her body in a fearful manner.At the cries of the wounded woman the neighbours ran to her assistance and set upon the furious animal. The wolf did not long defend himself he soon fell beneath the repeated blows of his assailants. When the peasants shouting with joy at their victory began to examine the creature by the light of the burning pine splinters they found to their surprise and horror that instead of a wolf they had killed their countryman who was lost seven years before and was supposed to have been changed into a wolf. They tried to restore him but it was too late. Whilst they were lamenting his unhappy end the faithless woman his wife died of the wounds she had received.

Langgona and his wife had twin boys named Bulanawan and Aguio. One day when they were about two years old the mother took Bulanawan to the field with her when she went to pick cotton. She spread the fiber she had gathered the day before on the ground to dry near the child and while she was getting more a great wind suddenly arose which wound the cotton around the baby and carried him away. Far away to a distant land the wind took Bulanawan and in that place he grew up. When he was a man he became a great warrior.One day while Bulanawan and his wife were walking along the seashore they sat down to rest on a large flat rock and Bulanawan fell asleep. Now Aguio the twin brother of Bulanawan had become a great warrior also and he went on a journey to this distant land not knowing that his brother was there. It happened that he was walking along the seashore in his wardress on this same day and when he saw the woman sitting on the large flat rock he thought her very beautiful and he determined to steal her.As he drew near he asked her to give him some of her husbands betelnut to chew and when she refused he went forward to fight her husband not knowing they were brothers. As soon as his wife awakened him Bulanawan sprang up seized her put her in the cuff of his sleeve and came forth ready to fight. Aguio grew very angry at this and they fought until their weapons were broken and the earth trembled.Now the two brothers of the rivals felt the earth tremble although they were far away and each feared that his brother was in trouble. One was in the mountains and he started at once for the sea the other was in a far land but he set out in a boat for the scene of the trouble.They arrived at the same time at the place of battle and they immediately joined in it. Then the trembling of the earth increased so much that Langgona the father of Aguio and Bulanawan sought out the spot and tried to make peace. But he only seemed to make matters worse and they all began fighting him. So great did the disturbance become that the earth was in danger of falling to pieces.Then it was that the father of Langgona came and settled the trouble and when all were at peace again they discovered that Aguio and Bulanawan were brothers and the grandsons of the peacemaker.
In the latter end of the autumn of 18 I set out by myself on an excursion over the northern part of Scotland and during that time my chief amusement was to observe the little changes of manners language etc. in the different districts. After having viewed on my return the principal curiosities in Buchan I made a little alehouse or public my headquarters for the night. Having discussed my supper in solitude I called up mine host to enable me to discuss my bottle and to give me a statistical account of the country around me. Seated in the blue end and well supplied with the homely but satisfying luxuries which the place afforded I was in an excellent mood for enjoying the communicativeness of my landlord and after speaking about the cave of Slaines the state of the crops and the neighbouring franklins edged him by degrees to speak about the Abbey of Deer an interesting ruin which I had examined in the course of the day formerly the stronghold of the once powerful family of Cummin.Its dootless a bonnie place about the abbey said he but naething like what it was when the great Sir James the Rose came to hide i the Buchan woods wi a the Grahames rampagin at his tail whilk you thats a beuklearned man ill hae read o an may be yell hae heard o the saughen bush where he forgathered wi his jo or aiblins ye may have seen t for its standing yet just at the corner o gaukit Jamie Jamiesons peatstack. Ay ay the abbey was a brave place once but a thing ye ken comes till an end. So saying he nodded to me and brought his glass to an end.This place then must have been famed in days of yore my friendYe may tak my word for that said he Od it was a place Sic a sight o fechtin as they had about it But gin yell gan up the trapstair to the laft an open Jennys kist yell see sic a story about it printed by ane o your learned Aberdeens fouk Maister Keith I think she coft it in Aberdeen for twal pennies lang ago an battered it to the lid o her kist. But gang up the stair canny for fear that you should wauken her puir thing or bide Ill just wauken Jamie Fleep an gar him help me down wit for our stairs no just that canny for them ts no acquaint wit let alane a frail man wi your infirmity.I assured him that I would neither disturb the young ladys slumber nor Jamie Fleeps and begged him to give me as much information as he could about this castle.Weel wishin your guid health again.Our minister ance said that Solomons Temple was a in ruins wi whin bushes an broom and thistles growin ower the bonnie carved wark an the cedar was just like our ain abbey. Noo I judge that the Abbey o Deer was just the marrow o t or the minister wadna hae said that. But when it was biggit Lord kens for I dinna. It was just as you see it lang afore your honour was born an aiblins as the byword says may be sae after yere hanged. But thats neither here nor there. The Cummins o Buchan were a dour and surly race and for a fearfu time nane near han nor far awa could ding them an yet mony a ane tried it. The fouk on their ain lan likit them weel enough but the Crawfords an the Grahames an the Mars an the Lovats were aye trying to comb them against the hair an mony a weary kempin had they wi them. But some way or ither they could never ding them an fouk said that they gaed and learned the black art frae the Pope o Room wha I myself heard the minister say had aye a colleague wi the Auld Chiel. I dinna ken fou it was in the tail o the day the hale country raise up against them an besieged them in the Abbey o Deer. Yell see my frien by this time mine host considered me as one of his cronies tho we ca it the abbey it had naething to do wi papistry na na no sae bad as a that either but just a nobles castle where they keepit sodgers gaun about in airn an scarlet wi their swords an guns an begnets an sentryboxes like the local militia in the barracks o Aberdeen.Weel ye see they surrounded the castle an lang did they besiege it but there was a vast o meat in the castle an the Buchan fouk fought like the vera deil. They took their horse through a miscellaneous passage half a mile long aneath the hill o Saplinbrae an watered them in the burn o Pulmer. But a wadna do they took the castle at last and a terrible slaughter they made amo them but they were sair disappointed in ae particler for Cummins fouk sank a their goud an siller in a drawwall an syne filled it up wi stanes. They got naething in the way of spulzie to speak o sae out o spite they dang doon the castle an its never been biggit to this day. But the Cummins were no sae bad as the Lairds o Federat after a.And who were these Federats I inquired.The Lairds o Federat said he moistening his mouth again as a preamble to his oration. Troth frae their deeds ane would maist think that they had a drap o the deils blude like the pyets. Gin a tales be true they hae the warmest place at his bink this vera minute. I dinna ken vera muckle about them though but the auldest fouk said they were just byous wi cruelty. Mony a good man did they hing up i their ha just for their ain sport yell see the ring to the fore yet in the roof o t. Did ye never hear o Mauns Stane neebourMauns what said I.Ou Mauns Stane. But its no likely. Ye see it was just a queer clump o a rounabout heathen waghlin may be twa tons or thereby. It wasna like ony o the stanes in our countra an it was as roun as a fitba Im sure it wad ding Professor Couplan himsel to tell what way it cam there. Noo fouk aye thought there was something uncanny about it an some gaed the length o saying that the deil used to bake ginshbread upont and as sure as yere sitting there frien there was knucklemarks upon t for my ain father has seen them as aften as I have taes an fingers. Aweel ye see Mauns Crawford the last o the Lairds o Federat an the deil had coost out may be because the laird was just as wicked an as clever as he was himsel an ye perceive the evil ane wantit to play him a trick. Noo Mauns Crawford was ae day lookin ower his castle wa and he saw a stalwart carle in black claes ridin up the loanin. He stopped at this chuckie o a stane an loutin himsel he took it up in his arms and lifted it three times to his saddlebow an syne he rade awa out o sight never comin near the castle as Mauns thought he would hae done. Noo says the baron till himsel says he I didna think that there was ony ane in a the land that could hae played sic a ploy but deil fetch me if I dinna lift it as weel as he did Sae aff he gaed for there wasna sic a man for birr in a the countra an he kent it as weel for he never met wi his match. Weel he tried and tugged and better than tugged at the stane but he coudna mudge it ava an when he looked about he saw a man at his ilbuck a smeared wi smiddycoom snightern an laughin at him. The laird dd him an bade him lift it whilk he did as gin t had been a little pinnin. The laird was like to burst wi rage at being fickled by sic a hagmahush carle and he took to the stane in a fury and lifted it till his knee but the weight o t amaist ground his banes to smash. He held the stane till his eenstrings crackit when he was as blin as a moudiwort. He was blin till the day o his deaththats to say if ever he died for there were queer sayings about itvera queer vera queer The stane was cad Mauns Stane ever after an it was no thought that canny to be near it after gloaming for what says the PsalmhemI mean the sangTween Ennetbutts an Mauns StaneIlka night there walks aneThere never was a chief of the family after the men were scattered an the castle demolished. The doo and the hoodiecraw nestle i their towers and the hare maks her form on their grassy hearthstane.Is this stone still to be seenOu na. Ye see it was just upon Johnie Forbess craft an fouk cam far an near to leuk at it an trampit down a the puir cottarbodys corn sae he houkit a hole just aside it and tumbled it intil t by that means naebody seest noo but its weel kent that its there for theyre livin yet whave seen it.But the well at the Abbeydid no one feel a desire to enrich himself with the gold and silver buried thereHoot ay mony a ane tried to find out whaur it was and for that matter Ive may be done as foolish a thing myself but nane ever made it out. There was a scholar like yoursel that gaed ae night down to the Abbey an ye see he summoned up the deil.The deuce he did said I.Weel weel the deuce gin ye like it better said he. An he was gaun to question him where the treasure was but he had eneuch to do to get him laid without deaving him wi questions for a the deils cam about him like bees biggin out o a byke. He never coured the fright he gat but cried out Help help till his very enemy wad hae been wae to see him and sae he cried till he died which was no that lang after. Fouk sudna meddle wi sic ploysMost wonderful And do you believe that Beelzebub actually appeared to himBelieve it What for no said he consequentially tapping the lid of his snuffhorn. Didna my ain father see the evil ane i the schule o Auld DeerWeel I wot he did that. A wheen idle callants when the dominie was out at his twalhours read the Lords Prayer backlans an raised him but couldna lay him again for he threepit ower them that he wadna gang awa unless he gat ane o them wi him. Ye may be sure this put them in an awfu swither. They were a squallin an crawlin and sprawlin amo the couples to get out o his grips. Ane o them gat out an tauld the maister about it an when he cam down the melted lead was runnin aff the roof o the house wi the heat sae flingin to the black thief a young bit kittlen o the schulemistresss he sank through the floor wi an awsome roar. I mysel have heard the mistress miscain her man about offering up the puir thing baith saul and body to Baal. But troth Im no clear to speak o the like o this at sic a time o night sae if your honour bena for another jug Ill een wus you a gudenight for its wearin late an I maun awa to Skippyfair i the mornin.I assented to this and quickly lost in sleep the remembrance of all these tales of the olden times.
Once there was a widow and she had one son called Jack. Jack and his mother owned just three cows. They lived well and happy for a long time but at last hard times came down on them and the crops failed and poverty looked in at the door and things got so sore against the poor widow that for want of money and for want of necessities she had to make up her mind to sell one of the cows. Jack she said one night go over in the morning to the fair to sell the branny cow.Well and good in the morning my brave Jack was up early and took a stick in his fist and turned out the cow and off to the fair he went with her and when Jack came into the fair he saw a great crowd gathered in a ring in the street. He went into the crowd to see what they were looking at and there in the middle of them he saw a man with a wee wee Harp a Mouse and a Bumclock Cockroach and a Bee to play the harp. And when the man put them down on the ground and whistled the Bee began to play the Harp and the Mouse and the Bumclock stood up on their hind legs and got hold of each other and began to waltz. And as soon as the Harp began to play and the Mouse and the Bumclock to dance there wasnt a man or woman or a thing in the fair that didnt begin to dance also and the pots and pans and the wheels and reels jumped and jigged all over the town and Jack himself and the branny cow were as bad as the next.There was never a town in such a state before or since and after a while the man picked up the Bee the Harp and the Mouse and the Bumclock and put them into his pocket and the men and women Jack and the cow the pots and pans wheels and reels that had hopped and jigged now stopped and everyone began to laugh as if to break its heart. Then the man turned to Jack. Jack says he how would you like to be master of all these animalsWhy says Jack I should like it fine.Well then says the man how will you and me make a bargain about themI have no money says Jack.But you have a fine cow says the man. I will give you the Bee and the Harp for it.O but Jack says says he my poor mother at home is very sad and sorrowful entirely and I have this cow to sell and lift her heart again.And better than this she cannot get says the man. For when she sees the Bee play the Harp she will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.Well says Jack says he that will be grand.He made the bargain. The man took the cow and Jack started home with the Bee and the Harp in his pocket and when he came home his mother welcomed him back.And Jack says she I see you have sold the cow.I have done that says Jack.Did you do well says the mother.I did well and very well says Jack.How much did you get for her says the mother.O says he it was not for money at all I sold her but for something far better.O Jack Jack says she what have you doneJust wait until you see mother says he and you will soon say I have done well.Out of his pocket he takes the Bee and the Harp and sets them in the middle of the floor and whistles to them and as soon as he did this the Bee began to play the Harp and the mother she looked at them and let a big great laugh out of her and she and Jack began to dance the pots and pans the wheels and reels began to jig and dance over the floor and the house itself hopped about also.When Jack picked up the Bee and the Harp again the dancing all stopped and the mother laughed for a long time. But when she came to herself she got very angry entirely with Jack and she told him he was a silly foolish fellow that there was neither food nor money in the house and now he had lost one of her good cows also. We must do something to live says she. Over to the fair you must go tomorrow morning and take the black cow with you and sell her.And off in the morning at an early hour brave Jack started and never halted until he was in the fair. When he came into the fair he saw a big crowd gathered in a ring in the street. Said Jack to himself I wonder what are they looking at.Into the crowd he pushed and saw the wee man this day again with a Mouse and a Bumclock and he put them down in the street and whistled. The Mouse and the Bumclock stood up on their hind legs and got hold of each other and began to dance there and jig and as they did there was not a man or woman in the street who didnt begin to jig also and Jack and the black cow and the wheels and the reels and the pots and pans all of them were jigging and dancing all over the town and the houses themselves were jumping and hopping about and such a place Jack or any one else never saw before.When the man lifted the Mouse and the Bumclock into his pocket they all stopped dancing and settled down and everybody laughed right hearty. The man turned to Jack. Jack said he I am glad to see you how would you like to have these animalsI should like well to have them says Jack says he only I cannot.Why cannot you says the man.O says Jack says he I have no money and my poor mother is very downhearted. She sent me to the fair to sell this cow and bring some money to lift her heart.O says the man says he if you want to lift your mothers heart I will sell you the Mouse and when you set the Bee to play the Harp and the Mouse to dance to it your mother will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.But I have no money says Jack says he to buy your Mouse.I dont mind says the man says he I will take your cow for it.Jack says she I see you have sold the cow.I did that says Jack.Did you sell her well says she.Very well indeed says Jack says he.How much did you get for herI didnt get money says he but I got value.O Jack Jack says she what do you meanI will soon show you that mother says he taking the Mouse out of his pocket and the Harp and the Bee and setting all on the floor and when he began to whistle the Bee began to play and the Mouse go up on its hind legs and began to dance and jig and the mother gave such a hearty laugh as she never laughed in her life before. To dancing and jigging herself and Jack fell and the pots and pans and the wheels and reels began to dance and jig over the floor and the house jigged also. And when they were tired of this Jack lifted the Harp and the Mouse and the Bee and put them in his pocket and his mother she laughed for a long time.But when she got over that she got very downhearted and very angry entirely with Jack. And O Jack she says you are a stupid goodfornothing fellow. We have neither money nor meat in the house and here you have lost two of my good cows and I have only one left now. Tomorrow morning she says you must be up early and take this cow to the fair and sell her. See to get something to lift my heart up.I will do that says Jack says he. So he went to his bed and early in the morning he was up and turned out the spotty cow and went to the fair.When Jack got to the fair he saw a crowd gathered in a ring in the street. I wonder what they are looking at anyhow says he. He pushed through the crowd and there he saw the same wee man he had seen before with a Bumclock and when he put the Bumclock on the ground he whistled and the Bumclock began to dance and the men women and children in the street and Jack and the spotty cow began to dance and jig also and everything on the street and about it the wheels and reels the pots and pans began to jig and the houses themselves began to dance likewise. And when the man lifted the Bumclock and put it in his pocket everybody stopped jigging and dancing and everyone laughed loud. The wee man turned and saw Jack.Jack my brave boy says he you will never be right fixed until you have this Bumclock for it is a very fancy thing to have.O but says Jack says he I have no money.No matter for that says the man you have a cow and that is as good as money to me.Well says Jack I have a poor mother who is very downhearted at home and she sent me to the fair to sell this cow and raise some money and lift her heart.O but Jack says the wee man this Bumclock is the very thing to lift her heart for when you put down your Harp and Bee and Mouse on the floor and put the Bumclock along with them she will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.Well that is surely true says Jack says he and I think I will make a swap with you.So Jack gave the cow to the man and took the Bumclock himself and started for home. His mother was glad to see Jack back and says she Jack I see that you have sold the cow.I did that mother says Jack.Did you sell her well Jack says the mother.Very well indeed mother says Jack.How much did you get for her says the mother.I didnt take any money for her mother but value says Jack and he takes out of his pocket the Bumclock and the Mouse and set them on the floor and began to whistle and the Bee began to play the Harp and the Mouse and the Bumclock stood up on their hind legs and began to dance and Jacks mother laughed very hearty and everything in the house the wheels and the reels and the pots and pans went jigging and hopping over the floor and the house itself went jigging and hopping about likewise.When Jack lifted up the animals and put them in his pocket everything stopped and the mother laughed for a good while. But after a while when she came to herself and saw what Jack had done and how they were now without either money or food or a cow she got very very angry at Jack and scolded him hard and then sat down and began to cry.Poor Jack when he looked at himself confessed that he was a stupid fool entirely. And what says he shall I now do for my poor mother He went out along the road thinking and thinking and he met a wee woman who said Goodmorrow to you Jack says she how is it you are not trying for the kings daughter of IrelandWhat do you mean says Jack.Says she Didnt you hear what the whole world has heard that the King of Ireland has a daughter who hasnt laughed for seven years and he has promised to give her in marriage and to give the kingdom along with her to any man who will take three laughs out of her.If that is so says Jack says he it is not here I should be.Back to the house he went and gathers together the Bee the Harp the Mouse and the Bumclock and putting them into his pocket he bade his mother goodbye and told her it wouldnt be long till she got news from him and off he hurries.When he reached the castle there was a ring of spikes all round the castle and mens heads on nearly every spike there.What heads are these Jack asked one of the kings soldiers.Any man that comes here trying to win the kings daughter and fails to make her laugh three times loses his head and has it stuck on a spike. These are the heads of the men that failed says he.A mighty big crowd says Jack says he. Then Jack sent word to tell the kings daughter and the king that there was a new man who had come to win her.In a very little time the king and the kings daughter and the kings court all came out and sat themselves down on gold and silver chairs in front of the castle and ordered Jack to be brought in until he should have his trial. Jack before he went took out of his pocket the Bee the Harp the Mouse the Bumclock and he gave the Harp to the Bee and he tied a string to one and the other and took the end of the string himself and marched into the castle yard before all the court with his animals coming on a string behind him.When the queen and the king and the court and the princes saw poor ragged Jack with his Bee and Mouse and Bumclock hopping behind him on a string they set up one roar of laughter that was long and loud enough and when the kings daughter herself lifted her head and looked to see what they were laughing at and saw Jack and his paraphernalia she opened her mouth and she let out of her such a laugh as was never heard before.Then Jack dropped a low courtesy and said Thank you my lady I have one of the three parts of you won.Then he drew up his animals in a circle and began to whistle and the minute he did the Bee began to play the Harp and the Mouse and the Bumclock stood up on their hind legs got hold of each other and began to dance and the king and the kings court and Jack himself began to dance and jig and everything about the kings castle pots and pans wheels and reels and the castle itself began to dance also. And the kings daughter when she saw this opened her mouth again and let out of her a laugh twice louder than she let before and Jack in the middle of his jigging drops another courtesy and says Thank you my lady that is two of the three parts of you won.Jack and his menagerie went on playing and dancing but Jack could not get the third laugh out of the kings daughter and the poor fellow saw his big head in danger of going on the spike. Then the brave Mouse came to Jacks help and wheeled round upon its heel and at it did so its tail swiped into the Bumclocks mouth and the Bumclock began to cough and cough and cough. And when the kings daughter saw this she opened her mouth again and she let the loudest and hardest and merriest laugh that was ever heard before or since and Thank you my lady says Jack dropping another courtesy I have all of you won.Then when Jack stopped his menagerie the king took himself and the menagerie within the castle. He was washed and combed and dressed in a suit of silk and satin with all kinds of gold and silver ornaments and then was led before the kings daughter. And true enough she confessed that a handsomer and finer fellow than Jack she had never seen and she was very willing to be his wife.Jack sent for his poor old mother and brought her to the wedding which lasted nine days and nine nights every night better than the other. All the lords and ladies and gentry of Ireland were at the wedding. I was at it too and got brogues broth and slippers of bread and came jigging home on my head.
Once there was a very poor man named Haamdaanee who begged from door to door for his living sometimes taking things before they were offered him. After a while people became suspicious of him and stopped giving him anything in order to keep him away from their houses. So at last he was reduced to the necessity of going every morning to the village dust heap and picking up and eating the few grains of the tiny little millet seed that he might find there.One day as he was scratching and turning over the heap he found a dime which he tied up in a corner of his ragged dress and continued to hunt for millet grains but could not find one. Oh well said he Ive got a dime now Im pretty well fixed. Ill go home and take a nap instead of a meal.So he went to his hut took a drink of water put some tobacco in his mouth and went to sleep.The next morning as he scratched in the dust heap he saw a countryman going along carrying a basket made of twigs and he called to him Hi there countryman What have you in that cageThe countryman whose name was Moohaadeem replied Gazelles.And Haamdaanee called Bring them here. Let me see them.Now there were three welltodo men standing near and when they saw the countryman coming to Haamdaanee they smiled and said Youre taking lots of trouble for nothing Moohaadeem.Hows that gentlemen he inquired.Why said they that poor fellow has nothing at all. Not a cent.Oh I dont know that said the countryman he may have plenty for all I know.Not he said they.Dont you see for yourself continued one of them that he is on the dust heap Every day he scratches there like a hen trying to get enough grains of millet to keep himself alive. If he had any money wouldnt he buy a square meal for once in his life Do you think he would want to buy a gazelle What would he do with it He cant find enough food for himself without looking for any for a gazelle.But Moohaadeem said Gentlemen I have brought some goods here to sell. I answer all who call me and if any one says Come I go to him. I dont favor one and slight another therefore as this man called me Im going to him.All right said the first man you dont believe us. Well we know where he lives and all about him and we know that he cant buy anything.Thats so said the second man. Perhaps however you will see that we were right after you have a talk with him.To which the third man added Clouds are a sign of rain but we have seen no signs of his being about to spend any money.All right gentlemen said Moohaadeem many betterlooking people than he call me and when I show them my gazelles they say Oh yes theyre very beautiful but awfully dear take them away. So I shall not be disappointed if this man says the same thing. I shall go to him anyhow.Then one of the three men said Let us go with this man and see what the beggar will buy.Pshaw said another buy You talk foolishly. He has not had a good meal in three years to my knowledge and a man in his condition doesnt have money to buy gazelles. However lets go and if he makes this poor countryman carry his load over there just for the fun of looking at the gazelles let each of us give him a good hard whack with our walkingsticks to teach him how to behave toward honest merchants.So when they came near him one of those three men said Well here are the gazelles now buy one. Here they are you old hypocrite youll feast your eyes on them but you cant buy them.But Haamdaanee paying no attention to the men said to Moohaadeem How much for one of your gazellesThen another of those men broke in Youre very innocent arent you You know as well as I do that gazelles are sold every day at two for a quarter.Still taking no notice of these outsiders Haamdaanee continued Id like to buy one for a dime.One for a dime laughed the men of course youd like to buy one for a dime. Perhaps youd also like to have the dime to buy with.Then one of them gave him a push on the cheek.At this Haamdaanee turned and said Why do you push me on the cheek when Ive done nothing to you I do not know you. I call this man to transact some business with him and you who are strangers step in to spoil our trade.He then untied the knot in the corner of his ragged coat produced the dime and handing it to Moohaadeem said Please good man let me have a gazelle for that.At this the countryman took a small gazelle out of the cage and handed it to him saying Here master take this one. I call it Keejeepaa. Then turning to those three men he laughed and said Ehe Hows this You with your white robes and turbans and swords and daggers and sandals on your feetyou gentlemen of property and no mistakeyou told me this man was too poor to buy anything yet he has bought a gazelle for a dime while you fine fellows I think havent enough money among you to buy half a gazelle if they were five cents each.Then Moohaadeem and the three men went their several ways.As for Haamdaanee he stayed at the dust heap until he found a few grains of millet for himself and a few for Keejeepaa the gazelle and then went to his hut spread his sleeping mat and he and the gazelle slept together.This going to the dust heap for a few grains of millet and then going home to bed continued for about a week.Then one night Haamdaanee was awakened by some one calling Master Sitting up he answered Here I am. Who calls The gazelle answered I doUpon this the beggar man became so scared that he did not know whether he should faint or get up and run away.Seeing him so overcome Keejeepaa asked Why master whats the matterOh gracious he gasped what a wonder I seeA wonder said the gazelle looking all around why what is this wonder that makes you act as if you were all broken upWhy its so wonderful I can hardly believe Im awake said his master. Who in the world ever before knew of a gazelle that could speakOho laughed Keejeepaa is that all There are many more wonderful things than that. But now listen while I tell you why I called you.Certainly Ill listen to every word said the man. I cant help listeningWell you see its just this way said Keejeepaa Ive allowed you to become my master and I can not run away from you so I want you to make an agreement with me and I will make you a promise and keep it.Say on said his master.Now continued the gazelle one doesnt have to be acquainted with you long in order to discover that you are very poor. This scratching a few grains of millet from the dust heap every day and managing to subsist upon them is all very well for youyoure used to it because its a matter of necessity with you but if I keep it up much longer you wont have any gazelleKeejeepaa will die of starvation. Therefore I want to go away every day and feed on my own kind of food and I promise you I will return every evening.Well I guess Ill have to give my consent said the man in no very cheerful tone.As it was now dawn Keejeepaa jumped up and ran out of the door Haamdaanee following him. The gazelle ran very fast and his master stood watching him until he disappeared. Then tears started in the mans eyes and raising his hands he cried Oh my mother Then he cried Oh my father Then he cried Oh my gazelle It has run awaySome of his neighbors who heard him carrying on in this manner took the opportunity to inform him that he was a fool an idiot and a dissipated fellow.Said one of them You hung around that dust heap goodness knows how long scratching like a hen till fortune gave you a dime. You hadnt sense enough to go and buy some decent food you had to buy a gazelle. Now youve let the creature run away. What are you crying about You brought all your trouble on yourself.All this of course was very comforting to Haamdaanee who slunk off to the dust heap got a few grains of millet and came back to his hut which now seemed meaner and more desolate than ever.At sunset however Keejeepaa came trotting in and the beggar was happy again and said Ah my friend you have returned to me.Of course said the gazelle didnt I promise you You see I feel that when you bought me you gave all the money you had in the world even though it was only a dime. Why then should I grieve you I couldnt do it. If I go and get myself some food Ill always come back evenings.When the neighbors saw the gazelle come home every evening and run off every morning they were greatly surprised and began to suspect that Haamdaanee was a wizard.Well this coming and going continued for five days the gazelle telling its master each night what fine places it had been to and what lots of food it had eaten.On the sixth day it was feeding among some thorn bushes in a thick wood when scratching away some bitter grass at the foot of a big tree it saw an immense diamond of intense brightness.Oho said Keejeepaa in great astonishment heres property and no mistake This is worth a kingdom If I take it to my master he will be killed for being a poor man if they say to him Where did you get it and he answers I picked it up they will not believe him if he says It was given to me they will not believe him either. It will not do for me to get my master into difficulties. I know what Ill do. Ill seek some powerful person he will use it properly.So Keejeepaa started off through the forest holding the diamond in his mouth and ran and ran but saw no town that day so he slept in the forest and arose at dawn and pursued his way. And the second day passed like the first.On the third day the gazelle had traveled from dawn until between eight and nine oclock when he began to see scattered houses getting larger in size and knew he was approaching a town. In due time he found himself in the main street of a large city leading direct to the sultans palace and began to run as fast as he could. People passing along stopped to look at the strange sight of a gazelle running swiftly along the main street with something wrapped in green leaves between its teeth.The sultan was sitting at the door of his palace when Keejeepaa stopping a little way off dropped the diamond from its mouth and lying down beside it panting called out Ho there Ho there which is a cry every one makes in that part of the world when wishing to enter a house remaining outside until the cry is answered.After the cry had been repeated several times the sultan said to his attendants Who is doing all that callingAnd one answered Master its a gazelle thats calling Ho thereHoho said the sultan Hoho Invite the gazelle to come near.Then three attendants ran to Keejeepaa and said Come get up. The sultan commands you to come near.So the gazelle arose picked up the diamond and approaching the sultan laid the jewel at his feet saying Master good afternoon To which the sultan replied May God make it good Come near.The sultan ordered his attendants to bring a carpet and a large cushion and desired the gazelle to rest upon them. When it protested that it was comfortable as it was he insisted and Keejeepaa had to allow himself to be made a very honored guest. Then they brought milk and rice and the sultan would hear nothing until the gazelle had fed and rested.At last when everything had been disposed of the sultan said Well now my friend tell me what news you bring.And Keejeepaa said Master I dont exactly know how you will like the news I bring. The fact is Im sent here to insult you Ive come to try and pick a quarrel with you In fact Im here to propose a family alliance with youAt this the sultan exclaimed Oh come for a gazelle you certainly know how to talk Now the fact of it is Im looking for some one to insult me. Im just aching to have some one pick a quarrel with me. Im impatient for a family alliance. Go on with your message.Then Keejeepaa said You dont bear any ill will against me who am only a messengerAnd the sultan said None at all.Well said Keejeepaa look at this pledge I bring dropping the diamond wrapped in leaves into the sultans lap.When the sultan opened the leaves and saw the great sparkling jewel he was overcome with astonishment. At last he said WellI have brought this pledge said the gazelle from my master Sultan Daaraaee. He has heard that you have a daughter so he sent you this jewel hoping you will forgive him for not sending something more worthy of your acceptance than this trifle.Goodness said the sultan to himself he calls this a trifle Then to the gazelle Oh thats all right thats all right. Im satisfied. The Sultan Daaraaee has my consent to marry my daughter and I dont want a single thing from him. Let him come emptyhanded. If he has more of these trifles let him leave them at home. This is my message and I hope you will make it perfectly clear to your master. The gazelle assured him that he would explain everything satisfactorily adding And now master I take my leave. I go straight to our own town and hope that in about eleven days we shall return to be your guests. So with mutual compliments they parted.In the meantime Haamdaanee was having an exceedingly tough time. Keejeepaa having disappeared he wandered about the town moaning Oh my poor gazelle my poor gazelle while the neighbors laughed and jeered at him until between them and his loss he was nearly out of his mind.But one evening when he had gone to bed Keejeepaa walked in. Up he jumped and began to embrace the gazelle and weep over it and carry on at a great rate.When he thought there had been about enough of this kind of thing the gazelle said Come come keep quiet my master. Ive brought you good news. But the beggar man continued to cry and fondle and declare that he had thought his gazelle was dead.At last Keejeepaa said Oh well master you see Im all right. You must brace up and prepare to hear my news and do as I advise you.Go on go on replied his master explain what you will Ill do whatever you require me to do. If you were to say Lie down on your back that I may roll you over the side of the hill I would lie down.Well said the gazelle there is not much to explain just now but Ill tell you this Ive seen many kinds of food food that is desirable and food that is objectionable but this food Im about to offer you is very sweet indeed.What said Haamdaanee. Is it possible that in this world there is anything that is positively good There must be good and bad in everything. Food that is both sweet and bitter is good food but if food were nothing but sweetness would it not be injuriousHm yawned the gazelle Im too tired to talk philosophy. Lets go to sleep now and when I call you in the morning all you have to do is to get up and follow me.So at dawn they set forth the gazelle leading the way and for five days they journeyed through the forest.On the fifth day they came to a stream and Keejeepaa said to his master Lie down here. When he had done so the gazelle set to and beat him so soundly that he cried out Oh let up I beg of youNow said the gazelle Im going away and when I return I expect to find you right here so dont you leave this spot on any account. Then he ran away and about ten oclock that morning he arrived at the house of the sultan. Now ever since the day Keejeepaa left the town soldiers had been placed along the road to watch for and announce the approach of Sultan Daaraaee so one of them when he saw the gazelle in the distance rushed up and cried to the sultan Sultan Daaraaee is coming Ive seen the gazelle running as fast as it can in this direction.The sultan and his attendants immediately set out to meet his guests but when they had gone a little way beyond the town they met the gazelle coming along alone who on reaching the sultan said Good day my master. The sultan replied in kind and asked the news but Keejeepaa said Ah do not ask me. I can scarcely walk and my news is badWhy how is that asked the sultan.Oh dear sighed the gazelle such misfortune and misery You see Sultan Daaraaee and I started alone to come here and we got along all right until we came to the thick part of the forest yonder when we were met by robbers who seized my master bound him beat him and took everything he had even stripping off every stitch of his clothing. Oh dear oh dearDear me said the sultan we must attend to this at once. So hurrying back with his attendants to his house he called a groom to whom he said Saddle the best horse in my stable and put on him my finest harness. Then he directed a woman servant to open the big inlaid chest and bring him a bag of clothes. When she brought it he picked out a loincloth and a long white robe and a black overjacket and a shawl for the waist and a turban cloth all of the very finest. Then he sent for a curved sword with a gold hilt and a curved dagger with gold filigree and a pair of elegant sandals and a fine walkingcane. Then the sultan said to Keejeepaa Take some of my soldiers and let them convey these things to Sultan Daaraaee that he may dress himself and come to me.But the gazelle answered Ah my master can I take these soldiers with me and put Sultan Daaraaee to shame There he lies beaten and robbed and I would not have any one see him. I can take everything by myself.Why exclaimed the sultan here is a horse and there are clothes and arms. I dont see how a little gazelle can manage all those things.But the gazelle had them fasten everything on the horses back and tie the end of the bridle around his own neck and then he set off alone amidst the wonder and admiration of the people of that city high and low.When he arrived at the place where he had left the beggarman he found him lying waiting for him and overjoyed at his return.Now said he I have brought you the sweet food I promised. Come get up and bathe yourself.With the hesitation of a person long unaccustomed to such a thing the man stepped into the stream and began to wet himself a little.Oh said the gazelle impatiently a little water like that wont do you much good get out into the deep pool.Dear me said the man timidly there is so much water there and where there is much water there are sure to be horrible animals.Animals What kind of animalsWell crocodiles water lizards snakes and at any rate frogs and they bite people and Im terribly afraid of all of them.Oh well said Keejeepaa do the best you can in the stream but rub yourself well with earth and for goodness sake scrub your teeth well with sand they are awfully dirty.So the man obeyed and soon made quite a change in his appearance.Then the gazelle said Here hurry up and put on these things. The sun has gone down and we ought to have started before this.So the man dressed himself in the fine clothes the sultan had sent and then he mounted the horse and they started the gazelle trotting on ahead.When they had gone some distance the gazelle stopped and said See here nobody who sees you now would suspect that you are the man who scratched in the dust heap yesterday. Even if we were to go back to our town the neighbors would not recognize you if it were only for the fact that your face is clean and your teeth are white. Your appearance is all right but I have a caution to give you. Over there where we are going I have procured for you the sultans daughter for a wife with all the usual wedding gifts. Now you must keep quiet. Say nothing except How dye do and Whats the news Let me do the talking.All right said the man that suits me exactly.Do you know what your name isOf course I do.Indeed Well what is itWhy my name is Haamdaanee.Not much laughed Keejeepaa your name is Sultan Daaraaee.Oh is it said his master. Thats good.So they started forward again and in a little while they saw soldiers running in every direction and fourteen of these joined them to escort them. Then they saw ahead of them the sultan and the vizirs and the emirs and the judges and the great men of the city coming to meet them.Now then said Keejeepaa get off your horse and salute your fatherinlaw. Thats him in the middle wearing the skyblue jacket.All right said the man jumping off his horse which was then led by a soldier.So the two met and the sultans shook hands and kissed each other and walked up to the palace together.Then they had a great feast and made merry and talked until night at which time Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle were put into an inner room with three soldiers at the door to guard and attend upon them.When the morning came Keejeepaa went to the sultan and said Master we wish to attend to the business which brought us here. We want to marry your daughter and the sooner the ceremony takes place the better it will please the Sultan Daaraaee.Why thats all right said the sultan the bride is ready. Let some one call the teacher Mwaaleemoo and tell him to come at once.When Mwaaleemoo arrived the sultan said See here we want you to marry this gentleman to my daughter right away.All right Im ready said the teacher. So they were married.Early the next morning the gazelle said to his master Now Im off on a journey. I shall be gone about a week but however long I am gone dont you leave the house till I return. Goodbye.Then he went to the real sultan and said Good master Sultan Daaraaee has ordered me to return to our town and put his house in order he commands me to be here again in a week if I do not return by that time he will stay here until I come.The sultan asked him if he would not like to have some soldiers go with him but the gazelle replied that he was quite competent to take care of himself as his previous journeys had proved and he preferred to go alone so with mutual good wishes they parted.But Keejeepaa did not go in the direction of the old village. He struck off by another road through the forest and after a time came to a very fine town of large handsome houses. As he went through the principal street right to the far end he was greatly astonished to observe that the town seemed to have no inhabitants for he saw neither man woman nor child in all the place.At the end of the main street he came upon the largest and most beautiful house he had ever seen built of sapphire and turquoise and costly marbles.Oh my said the gazelle this house would just suit my master. Ill have to pluck up my courage and see whether this is deserted like the other houses in this mysterious town.So Keejeepaa knocked at the door and called Hullo there several times but no one answered. And he said to himself This is strange If there were no one inside the door would be fastened on the outside. Perhaps they are in another part of the house or asleep. Ill call again louder.So he called again very loud and long Hullo there Hullo And directly an old woman inside answered Who is that calling so loudlyIt is I your grandchild good mistress said Keejeepaa.If you are my grandchild replied the old woman go back to your home at once dont come and die here and bring me to my death also.Oh come said he open the door mistress I have just a few words I wish to say to you.My dear grandson she replied the only reason why I do not open the door is because I fear to endanger both your life and my own.Oh dont worry about that I guess your life and mine are safe enough for a while. Open the door anyhow and hear the little I have to say.So the old woman opened the door.Then they exchanged salutations and compliments after which she asked the gazelle Whats the news from your place grandsonOh everything is going along pretty well said he whats the news around hereAh sighed the old creature the news here is very bad. If youre looking for a place to die in youve struck it here. Ive not the slightest doubt youll see all you want of death this very day.Huh replied Keejeepaa lightly for a fly to die in honey is not bad for the fly and doesnt injure the honey.It may be all very well for you to be easy about it persisted the old person but if people with swords and shields did not escape how can a little thing like you avoid danger I must again beg of you to go back to the place you came from. Your safety seems of more interest to me than it is to you.Well you see I cant go back just now and besides I want to find out more about this place. Who owns itAh grandson in this house are enormous wealth numbers of people hundreds of horses and the owner is Neeoka Mkoo the wonderfully big snake. He owns this whole town also.Oho Is that so said Keejeepaa. Look here old lady cant you put me on to some plan of getting near this big snake that I may kill himMercy cried the old woman in affright dont talk like that. Youve put my life in danger already for Im sure Neeoka Mkoo can hear what is said in this house wherever he is. You see Im a poor old woman and I have been placed here with those pots and pans to cook for him. Well when the big snake is coming the wind begins to blow and the dust flies as it would do in a great storm. Then when he arrives in the courtyard he eats until he is full and after that goes inside there to drink water. When he has finished he goes away again. This occurs every other day just when the sun is overhead. I may add that Neeoka Mkoo has seven heads. Now then do you think yourself a match for himLook here mother said the gazelle dont you worry about me. Has this big snake a swordHe has. This is it said she taking from its peg a very keen and beautiful blade and handing it to him but whats the use in bothering about it We are dead already.We shall see about that said Keejeepaa.Just at that moment the wind began to blow and the dust to fly as if a great storm were approaching.Do you hear the great one coming cried the old woman.Pshaw said the gazelle Im a great one alsoand I have the advantage of being on the inside. Two bulls cant live in one cattlepen. Either he will live in this house or I will.Notwithstanding the terror the old lady was in she had to smile at the assurance of this little undersized gazelle and repeated over again her account of the people with swords and shields who had been killed by the big snake.Ah stop your gabbling said the gazelle you cant always judge a banana by its color or size. Wait and see grandma.In a very little while the big snake Neeoka Mkoo came into the courtyard and went around to all the pots and ate their contents. Then he came to the door.Hullo old lady said he how is it I smell a new kind of odor inside thereOh thats nothing good master replied the old woman Ive been so busy around here lately I havent had time to look after myself but this morning I used some perfume and thats what you smell.Now Keejeepaa had drawn the sword and was standing just inside the doorway so when the big snake put his head in it was cut off so quickly that its owner did not know it was gone. When he put in his second head it was cut off with the same quickness and feeling a little irritation he exclaimed Whos inside there scratching me He then thrust in his third head and that was cut off also.This continued until six heads had been disposed of when Neeoka Mkoo unfolded his rings and lashed around so that the gazelle and the old woman could not see one another through the dust.Then the snake thrust in his seventh head and the gazelle crying Now your time has come youve climbed many trees but this you can not climb severed it and immediately fell down in a fainting fit.Well that old woman although she was seventyfive years of age jumped and shouted and laughed like a girl of nine. Then she ran and got water and sprinkled the gazelle and turned him this way and that way until at last he sneezed which greatly pleased the old person who fanned him and tended him until he was quite recovered.Oh my said she who would have thought you could be a match for him my grandsonWell well said Keejeepaa thats all over. Now show me everything around this place.So she showed him everything from top to bottom storerooms full of goods chambers full of expensive foods rooms containing handsome people who had been kept prisoners for a long time slaves and everything.Next he asked her if there was any person who was likely to lay claim to the place or make any trouble and she answered No one everything here belongs to you.Very well then said he you stay here and take care of these things until I bring my master. This place belongs to him now.Keejeepaa stayed three days examining the house and said to himself Well when my master comes here he will be much pleased with what I have done for him and hell appreciate it after the life hes been accustomed to. As to his fatherinlaw there is not a house in his town that can compare with this.On the fourth day he departed and in due time arrived at the town where the sultan and his master lived. Then there were great rejoicings the sultan being particularly pleased at his return while his master felt as if he had received a new lease of life.After everything had settled down a little Keejeepaa told his master he must be ready to go with his wife to his new home after four days. Then he went and told the sultan that Sultan Daaraaee desired to take his wife to his own town in four days to which the sultan strongly objected but the gazelle said it was his masters wish and at last everything was arranged.On the day of the departure a great company assembled to escort Sultan Daaraaee and his bride. There were the brides ladiesinwaiting and slaves and horsemen and Keejeepaa leading them all.So they traveled three days resting when the sun was overhead and stopping each evening about five oclock to eat and sleep arising next morning at daybreak eating and going forward again. And all this time the gazelle took very little rest going all through the company from the ladies to the slaves and seeing that every one was well supplied with food and quite comfortable therefore the entire company loved him and valued him like the apples of their eyes.On the fourth day during the afternoon many houses came into view and some of the folks called Keejeepaas attention to them. Certainly said he that is our town and that house you see yonder is the palace of Sultan Daaraaee.So they went on and all the company filed into the courtyard while the gazelle and his master went into the house.When the old woman saw Keejeepaa she began to dance and shout and carry on just as she did when he killed Neeoka Mkoo and taking up his foot she kissed it but Keejeepaa said Old lady let me alone the one to be made much of is this my master Sultan Daaraaee. Kiss his feet he has the first honors whenever he is present.The old woman excused herself for not knowing the master and then Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle went around on a tour of inspection. The sultan ordered all the prisoners to be released the horses to be sent out to pasture all the rooms to be swept the furniture to be dusted and in the meantime servants were busy preparing food. Then every one had apartments assigned to him and all were satisfied. After they had remained there some time the ladies who had accompanied the bride expressed a desire to return to their own homes. Keejeepaa begged them not to hurry away but after a while they departed each loaded with gifts by the gazelle for whom they had a thousand times more affection than for his master. Then things settled down to their regular routine.One day the gazelle said to the old woman I think the conduct of my master is very singular. I have done nothing but good for him all the time I have been with him. I came to this town and braved many dangers for him and when all was over I gave everything to him. Yet he has never asked How did you get this house How did you get this town Who is the owner of this house Have you rented all these things or have they been given you What has become of the inhabitants of the place I dont understand him. And further although I have done nothing but good for him he has never done one good thing for me. Nothing here is really his. He never saw such a house or town as this since the day he was born and he doesnt own anything of it. I believe the old folks were right when they said If you want to do any person good dont do too much do him a little harm occasionally and hell think more of you. However Ive done all I can now and Id like to see him make some little return.Next morning the old woman was awakened early by the gazelle calling Mother Mother When she went to him she found he was sick in his stomach feverish and all his legs ached.Go said he and tell my master I am very ill.So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting on a marble couch covered with a striped silk scarf from India. Well said the master what do you want old womanOh my master cried she Keejeepaa is sickThe mistress started and said Dear me What is the matter with himAll his body pains him. He is sick all over.Oh well said the master what can I do Go and get some of that red millet that is too common for our use and make him some gruel.Gracious exclaimed his wife staring at him in amazement do you wish her to feed our friend with stuff that a horse would not eat if he were ever so hungry This is not right of you.Ah get out said he youre crazy. We eat rice isnt red millet good enough for a gazelle that cost only a dimeOh but he is no ordinary gazelle. He should be as dear to you as the apple of your eye. If sand got in your eye it would trouble you.You talk too much returned her husband then turning to the old woman he said Go and do as I told you.So the old woman went downstairs and when she saw the gazelle she began to cry and say Oh dear oh dearIt was a long while before the gazelle could persuade her to tell him what had passed upstairs but at last she told him all. When he had heard it he said Did he really tell you to make me red millet gruelAh cried she do you think I would say such a thing if it were not soWell said Keejeepaa I believe what the old folks said was right. However well give him another chance. Go up to him again and tell him I am very sick and that I cant eat that gruel.So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting by the window drinking coffee.The master looking around and seeing her said Whats the matter now old womanAnd she said Master I am sent by Keejeepaa. He is very sick indeed and has not taken the gruel you told me to make for him.Oh bother he exclaimed. Hold your tongue and keep your feet still and shut your eyes and stop your ears with wax then if that gazelle tells you to come up here say that your legs are stiff and if he tells you to listen say your ears are deaf and if he tells you to look say your sight has failed you and if he wants you to talk tell him your tongue is paralyzed.When the old woman heard these words she stood and stared and was unable to move. As for his wife her face became sad and the tears began to start from her eyes observing which her husband said sharply Whats the matter with you sultans daughterThe lady replied A mans madness is his undoing.Why do you say that mistress he inquired.Ah said she I am grieved my husband at your treatment of Keejeepaa. Whenever I say a good word for the gazelle you dislike to hear it. I pity you that your understanding is gone.What do you mean by talking in that manner to me he blustered.Why advice is a blessing if properly taken. A husband should advise with his wife and a wife with her husband then they are both blessed.Oh stop said her husband impatiently its evident youve lost your senses. You should be chained up. Then he said to the old woman Never mind her talk and as to this gazelle tell him to stop bothering me and putting on style as if he were the sultan. I cant eat I cant drink I cant sleep because of that gazelle worrying me with his messages. First the gazelle is sick then the gazelle doesnt like what he gets to eat. Confound it If he likes to eat let him eat if he doesnt like to eat let him die and be out of the way. My mother is dead and my father is dead and I still live and eat shall I be put out of my way by a gazelle that I bought for a dime telling me he wants this thing or that thing Go and tell him to learn how to behave himself toward his superiors.When the old woman went downstairs she found the gazelle was bleeding at the mouth and in a very bad way. All she could say was My son the good you did is all lost but be patient.And the gazelle wept with the old woman when she told him all that had passed and he said Mother I am dying not only from sickness but from shame and anger at this mans ingratitude.After a while Keejeepaa told the old woman to go and tell the master that he believed he was dying. When she went upstairs she found Daaraaee chewing sugarcane and she said to him Master the gazelle is worse we think him nearer to dying than getting well.To which he answered Havent I told you often enough not to bother meThen his wife said Oh husband wont you go down and see the poor gazelle If you dont like to go let me go and see him. He never gets a single good thing from you.But he turned to the old woman and said Go and tell that nuisance of a gazelle to die eleven times if he chooses to.Now husband persisted the lady what has Keejeepaa done to you Has he done you any wrong Such words as yours people use to their enemies only. Surely the gazelle is not your enemy. All the people who know him great and lowly love him dearly and they will think it very wrong of you if you neglect him. Now do be kind to him Sultan Daaraaee.But he only repeated his assertion that she had lost her wits and would have nothing further of argument.So the old woman went down and found the gazelle worse than ever.In the meantime Sultan Daaraaees wife managed to give some rice to a servant to cook for the gazelle and also sent him a soft shawl to cover him and a pillow to lie upon. She also sent him a message that if he wished she would have her fathers best physicians attend him.All this was too late however for just as these good things arrived Keejeepaa died.When the people heard he was dead they went running around crying and having an awful time and when Sultan Daaraaee found out what all the commotion was about he was very indignant remarking Why you are making as much fuss as if I were dead and all over a gazelle that I bought for a dimeBut his wife said Husband it was this gazelle that came to ask me of my father it was he who brought me from my fathers and it was to him I was given by my father. He gave you everything good and you do not possess a thing that he did not procure for you. He did everything he could to help you and you not only returned him unkindness but now he is dead you have ordered people to throw him into the well. Let us alone that we may weep.But the gazelle was taken and thrown into the well.Then the lady wrote a letter telling her father to come to her directly and despatched it by trusty messengers upon the receipt of which the sultan and his attendants started hurriedly to visit his daughter.When they arrived and heard that the gazelle was dead and had been thrown into the well they wept very much and the sultan and the vizir and the judges and the rich chief men all went down into the well and brought up the body of Keejeepaa and took it away with them and buried it.Now that night the lady dreamt that she was at home at her fathers house and when dawn came she awoke and found she was in her own bed in her own town again.And her husband dreamed that he was on the dust heap scratching and when he awoke there he was with both hands full of dust looking for grains of millet. Staring wildly he looked around to the right and left saying Oh who has played this trick on me How did I get back here I wonderJust then the children going along and seeing him laughed and hooted at him calling out Hullo Haamdaanee where have you been Where do you come from We thought you were dead long ago.So the sultans daughter lived in happiness with her people until the end and that beggarman continued to scratch for grains of millet in the dust heap until he died.If this story is good the goodness belongs to all if it is bad the badness belongs only to him who told it.
Two brothers once lived upon a little plot of groundone rich the other poor. The poor brother went to the rich one to beg of him a horse that he might fetch wood from the forest. His brother gave him the horse but the poor one begged of him likewise a horsecollar whereat the other was angry and would not give it him. So the poor fellow in his trouble fastened the sledge to the horses tail and thus drove to the forest and got such a load of wood that the horse had scarcely strength to draw it. When he came home he opened the gate but forgot to remove the footboard fastened to the side posts to keep the snow from coming in under the door and the horse stumbled against the board and lost his tail. The poor fellow took the horse back but when his brother saw the beast without a tail he would not have him and set out to go before the judge Shemyaka to make a complaint. The poor man saw that he would fall into trouble and the judge would send for him he considered for a long while that he had nothing to give and he followed his brother on foot.On the way as night came on they stopped at the house of a merchant. The rich brother was taken in to supper and well treated but the poor man was not given anything to eat and had to take his nights rest on the kitchen stove. All night he was tossing and rolling about hungry and at last he fell off the stove on to a cradle lying beside it and killed the merchants baby in the fall. So the merchant was very angry and next morning went with him to get the poor man punished by the judge Shemyaka.It so happened that on the way to town the party had to go over a bridge and the poor man was so frightened at the thought of what the judge Shemyaka might do to him that he threw himself over the bridge to put an end to his life but just at that instant a young man was driving his sick father to the bathhouse and the poor man fell upon the sledge and crushed the old man. So the son went with the rich brother and the merchant to the judge to make his complaint that the poor man had killed his father.The judge thought the towel was full of roubles. Illustration by J.R. Rosciezewksi published in The Russian Garland of Fairy Tales by Robert Steel 1916 Robert McBride and CompanyThe rich brother came first before the judge Shemyaka and complained that his brother had pulled off the tail of his horse. The poor man took a stone and tied it in a towel and standing up behind his brother he held it up to the judge intending to kill him unless he decided in his favour. The judge thought that the towel was filled with roubles and so he ordered the rich man to give back the horse to the poor one until his tail had grown again.Then the merchant came up to complain of the death of his baby and the poor man again brandished his heavy towel before the judge and because he hoped for another bribe the judge said You must send your wife to the poor mans house till she has another baby and then you will be as well off as before.Then the son came and accused the poor man of having crushed his father to death and asked the judge for justice. The poor man took up the stone again and showed it as before to the judge who fancied that the man would perhaps give him for this charge another hundred roubles. So he ordered the son to stand on the bridge while the poor man passed under it and that the son should in like manner leap down upon the poor man and crush him.So the poor brother came to the rich one to fetch the horse without a tail according to the judges sentence and to keep it until the tail grew again. The rich man was very loth to give up the horse and instead made him a present of five roubles three bushels of corn and a milch goat and thus they settled their quarrel.So then the poor man went to the merchant to take his wife away from him and the merchant offered him fifty roubles a cow with her calf a mare with her foal and five measures of grain which he willingly accepted.Then the poor man went to the son and said Come the judge has said that you must place yourself on the bridge while I stand under it and you must throw yourself down on me and kill me. Then the son thought to himself Who knows but that if I throw myself from the bridge I may perhaps instead of falling on this man dash myself to pieces. So he tried to make peace with the poor man and gave him two hundred roubles a horse and five measures of corn.But the judge Shemyaka sent his servant to the poor man to ask for the three hundred roubles. The poor man showed him the stone and said If the judge had not decided in my favour I should have killed him. So the servant went back to the judge and told him what the poor man had said whereat the judge overjoyed exclaimed Heaven be thanked that I decided in this mans favour
Once upon a time there was a boy named Ma whose father taught him himself at home. The window of the upper story looked out on the rear upon a terrace belonging to old Wang who had a garden of chrysanthemums there. One day Ma rose early and stood leaning against the window watching the day dawn. And out came old Wang from his terrace and watered his chrysanthemums. When he had just finished and was going in again along came a watercarrier bearing two pails on his shoulders who seemed to want to help him. But the old man grew annoyed and motioned him off. Yet the watercarrier insisted on mounting the terrace. So they pulled each other about on the terraceedge. It had been raining the terrace was slippery its border high and narrow and when the old man thrust back the watercarrier with his hand the latter lost his balance slipped and tumbled down the slope. Then the old man hastened down to pick him up but the two pails had fallen on his chest and he lay there with feet outstretched. The old man was extremely frightened. Without uttering a sound he took hold of the watercarriers feet and dragged him through the back door to the bank of the stream which flowed by the garden. Then he fetched the pails and set them down beside the corpse. After that he went home locked the door and went to bed again.Little Ma in spite of his youth thought it would be better to say nothing about an affair of this kind in which a human life was involved. He shut the window and withdrew. The sun rose higher and soon he heard a clamor without A dead man is lying on the riverbank The constable gave notice and in the afternoon the judge came up to the beating of gongs and the inspector of the dead knelt down and uncovered the corpse yet the body showed no wound. So it was said He slipped and fell to his death The judge questioned the neighbors but the neighbors all insisted that they knew nothing of the matter. Thereupon the judge had the body placed in a coffin sealed it with his seal and ordered that the relatives of the deceased be found. And then he went his way.Nine years passed by and young Ma had reached the age of twentyone and become a baccalaureate. His father had died and the family was poor. So it came about that in the same room in which he had formerly studied his lessons he now gathered a few pupils about him to instruct them.The time for examinations drew near. Ma had risen early in order to work. He opened the window and there in the distant alley he saw a man with two pails gradually drawing nearer. When he looked more closely it was the watercarrier. Greatly frightened he thought that he had returned to repay old Wang. Yet he passed the old mans door without entering it. Then he went a few steps further to the house of the Lis and there went in. The Lis were wealthy people and since they were near neighbors the Mas and they were on a visiting footing. The matter seemed very questionable to Ma and he got up and followed the watercarrier.At the door of Lis house he met an old servant who was just coming out and who said Heaven is about to send a child to our mistress I must go buy incense to burn to the gods in order to show our gratitudeMa asked Did not a man with two pails of water on his shoulder just go inThe servant said there had not but before he had finished speaking a maid came from the house and said You need not go to buy incense for I have found some. And through the favor of heaven the child has already come to us. Then Ma began to realize that the watercarrier had returned to be born again into the life of earth and not to exact retribution. He wondered though for what merit of his the former watercarrier happened to be reborn into so wealthy a family. So he kept the matter in mind and from time to time inquired as to the childs wellbeing.Seven more years went by and the boy gradually grew up. He did not show much taste for learning but he loved to keep birds. Old Wang was still strong and healthy. And though he was by this time more than eighty years old his love for his chrysanthemums had only increased with age.One day Ma once more rose early and stood leaning against his window. And he saw old Wang come out upon his terrace and begin to water his chrysanthemums. Little Li sat in the upper story of his house flying his pigeons. Suddenly some of the pigeons flew down on the railing of the flowergarden. The boy was afraid they might fly off and called them but the pigeons did not move. The boy did not know what to do he picked up stones and threw them at the birds. By mistake one of them struck old Wang. The old man started slipped and fell down over the terrace. Time passed and he did not rise. He lay there with his feet outstretched. The boy was very much frightened. Without uttering a sound he softly closed his window and went away. The sun gradually rose higher and the old mans sons and grandsons all came out to look for him. They found him and said He slipped and fell to his death And they buried him as was the custom.Note This little tale from the Sin Tsi Hia is a literary masterpiece because of the exactness with which the punishment follows upon the act long after the latter has been forgiven and all chance of mishap seemed to have passed.
Long long ago there lived a very rich nobleman. But though he was so rich he was not happy for he had no children to whom he could leave his wealth. He was besides no longer young. Every day he and his wife went to church to pray for a son. At last after long waiting God sent them what they desired. Now the evening before its arrival the father dreamed that its chance of living would depend upon one condition namely that its feet never touched the earth until it was twelve years old. Great care was taken that this should be avoided and when the little stranger came only trustworthy nurses were employed to look after him. As the years passed on the child was diligently guarded sometimes he was carried in his nurses arms sometimes rocked in his golden cradle but his feet never touched the ground.Now when the end of the time drew near the father began preparations for a magnificent feast which should be given to celebrate his sons release. One day while these were in progress a frightful noise followed by most unearthly yells shook the castle. The nurse dropped the child in her terror and ran to the window that instant the noises ceased. On turning to take up the boy imagine her dismay when she found him no longer there and remembered that she had disobeyed her masters orders.Hearing her screams and lamentations all the servants of the castle ran to her. The father soon followed asking What is the matter What has happened Where is my child The nurse trembling and weeping told of the disappearance of his son his only child. No words can tell the anguish of the fathers heart. He sent servants in every direction to hunt for his boy he gave orders he begged and prayed he threw away money right and left he promised everything if only his son might be restored to him. Search was made without loss of time but no trace of him could be discovered he had vanished as completely as if he had never existed.Many years later the unhappy nobleman learnt that in one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle footsteps as of some one walking up and down and dismal groans were heard every midnight. Anxious to follow the matter up for he thought it might in some way concern his lost son he made known that a reward of three hundred gold pieces would be given to any one who would watch for one whole night in the haunted room. Many were willing but had not the courage to stay till the end for at midnight when the dismal groans were heard they would run away rather than risk their lives for three hundred gold pieces. The poor father was in despair and knew not how to discover the truth of this dark mystery.Now close to the castle dwelt a widow a miller by trade who had three daughters. They were very poor and hardly earned enough for their daily needs. When they heard of the midnight noises in the castle and the promised reward the eldest daughter said As we are so very poor we have nothing to lose surely we might try to earn these three hundred gold pieces by remaining in the room one night. I should like to try mother if you will let me.The mother shrugged her shoulders she hardly knew what to say but when she thought of their poverty and the difficulty they had to earn a living she gave permission for her eldest daughter to remain one night in the haunted room. Then the daughter went to ask the noblemans consent.Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night in a room haunted by ghosts Are you sure you are not afraid my good girlI am willing to try this very night she replied. I would only ask you to give me some food to cook for my supper for I am very hungry.Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything she wanted and indeed enough food was given her not for one supper only but for three. With the food some dry firewood and a candle she entered the room. Like a good housewife she first lit the fire and put on her saucepans then she laid the table and made the bed. This filled up the early part of the evening. The time passed so quickly that she was surprised to hear the clock strike twelve while at the last stroke footsteps as of some one walking shook the room and dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from one corner to the other but could not see any one. But the footsteps and the groans did not cease. Suddenly a young man approached her and asked For whom is this food cookedFor myself she said.The gentle face of the stranger saddened and after a short silence he asked again And this table for whom is it laidFor myself she replied.The brow of the young man clouded over and the beautiful blue eyes filled with tears as he asked once more And this bed for whom have you made itFor myself replied she in the same selfish and indifferent tone.Tears fell from his eyes as he waved his arms and vanished.Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened but without mentioning the painful impression her answers had made upon the stranger. The three hundred golden crowns were paid and the father was thankful to have at last heard something that might possibly lead to the discovery of his son.On the following day the second daughter having been told by her sister what to do and how to answer the stranger went to the castle to offer her services. The nobleman willingly agreed and orders were given that she should be provided with everything she might want. Without loss of time she entered the room lit the fire put on the saucepans spread a white cloth upon the table made the bed and awaited the hour of midnight. When the young stranger appeared and asked For whom is this food prepared for whom is the table laid for whom is the bed made she answered as her sister had bidden her For me for myself only.As on the night before he burst into tears waved his arms and suddenly disappeared.Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened except the sad impression her answers had made upon the stranger. The three hundred gold pieces were given her and she went home.On the third day the youngest daughter wanted to try her fortune.Sisters said she as you have succeeded in earning three hundred gold crowns each and so helping our dear mother I too should like to do my part and remain a night in the haunted room.Now the widow loved her youngest daughter more dearly than the others and dreaded to expose her to any danger but as the elder ones had been successful she allowed her to take her chance. So with the instructions from her sisters as to what she should do and say and with the noblemans consent and abundant provisions she entered the haunted room. Having lit the fire put on the saucepans laid the table and made the bed she awaited with hope and fear the hour of midnight.As twelve oclock struck the room was shaken by the footsteps of some one who walked up and down and the air was filled with cries and groans. The girl looked everywhere but no living being could she see. Suddenly there stood before her a young man who asked in a sweet voice For whom have you prepared this foodNow her sisters had told her how to answer and how to act but when she looked into the sad eyes of the stranger she resolved to treat him more kindly.Well you do not answer me for whom is the food prepared he asked again impatiently as she made no reply. Somewhat confused she said I prepared it for myself but you too are welcome to it.At these words his brow grew more serene.And this table for whom is it spreadFor myself unless you will honour me by being my guest.A bright smile illumined his face.And this bed for whom have you made itFor myself but if you have need of rest it is for you.He clapped his hands for joy and replied Ah thats right I accept the invitation with pleasure and all that you have been so kind as to offer me. But wait I pray you wait for me I must first thank my kind friends for the care they have taken of me.A fresh warm breath of spring filled the air while at the same moment a deep precipice opened in the middle of the floor. He descended lightly and she anxious to see what would happen followed him holding on to his mantle. Thus they both reached the bottom of the precipice. Down there a new world opened itself before her eyes. To the right flowed a river of liquid gold to the left rose high mountains of solid gold in the centre lay a large meadow covered with millions of flowers. The stranger went on the girl followed unnoticed. And as he went he saluted the field flowers as old friends caressing them and leaving them with regret. Then they came to a forest where the trees were of gold. Many birds of different kinds began to sing and flying round the young stranger perched familiarly on his head and shoulders. He spoke to and petted each one. While thus engaged the girl broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and hid it in remembrance of this strange land.Leaving the forest of gold they reached a wood where all the trees were of silver. Their arrival was greeted by an immense number of animals of various kinds. These crowded together and pushed one against another to get close to their friend. He spoke to each one and stroked and petted them. Meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of silver from one of the trees saying to herself These will serve me as tokens of this wonderful land for my sisters would not believe me if I only told them of it.When the young stranger had taken leave of all his friends he returned by the paths he had come and the girl followed without being seen. Arrived at the foot of the precipice he began to ascend she coming silently after holding on to his mantle. Up they went higher and higher until they reached the room in the castle. The floor closed up without trace of the opening. The girl returned to her place by the fire where she was standing when the young man approached.All my farewells have been spoken said he now we can have supper.She hastened to place upon the table the food so hurriedly prepared and sitting side by side they supped together. When they had made a good meal he said Now it is time to rest.He lay down on the carefullymade bed and the girl placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had picked in the Mineral Land. In a few moments he was sleeping peacefully.Next day the sun was already high in the sky and yet the girl had not come to give an account of herself. The nobleman became impatient he waited and waited becoming more and more uneasy. At last he determined to go and see for himself what had happened. Picture to yourself his surprise and joy when on entering the haunted chamber he saw his longlost son sleeping on the bed while beside him sat the widows beautiful daughter. At that moment the son awoke. The father overwhelmed with joy summoned the attendants of the castle to rejoice with him in his newfound happiness.Then the young man saw the two branches of metal and said with astonishment What do I see Did you then follow me down there Know that by this act you have broken the spell and released me from the enchantment. These two branches will make two palaces for our future dwelling.Thereupon he took the branches and threw them out of the window. Immediately there were seen two magnificent palaces one of gold the other of silver. And there they lived happily as man and wife the noblemans son and the millers daughter. And if not dead they live there still.
A poor servantgirl was once travelling with the family with which she was in service through a great forest and when they were in the midst of it robbers came out of the thicket and murdered all they found. All perished together except the girl who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright and hidden herself behind a tree. When the robbers had gone away with their booty she came out and beheld the great disaster. Then she began to weep bitterly and said What can a poor girl like me do now I do not know how to get out of the forest no human being lives in it so I must certainly starve.She walked about and looked for a road but could find none. When it was evening she seated herself under a tree gave herself into Gods keeping and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away let what might happen. When however she had sat there for a while a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its mouth. It put the little key in her hand and said Dost thou see that great tree therein is a little lock it opens with the tiny key and there thou wilt find food enough and suffer no more hunger.Then she went to the tree and opened it and found milk in a little dish and white bread to break into it so that she could eat her fill. When she was satisfied she said It is now the time when the hens at home go to roost I am so tired I could go to bed too.Then the dove flew to her again and brought another golden key in its bill and said Open that tree there and thou wilt find a bed.So she opened it and found a beautiful white bed and she prayed God to protect her during the night and lay down and slept. In the morning the dove came for the third time and again brought a little key and said Open that tree there and thou wilt find clothes.And when she opened it she found garments beset with gold and with jewels more splendid than those of any kings daughter. So she lived there for some time and the dove came every day and provided her with all she needed and it was a quiet good life.Once however the dove came and said Wilt thou do something for my sakeWith all my heart said the girl.Then said the little dove I will guide thee to a small house enter it and inside it an old woman will be sitting by the fire and will say Goodday. But on thy life give her no answer let her do what she will but pass by her on the right side further on there is a door which open and thou wilt enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds are lying amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining stones leave them however where they are and seek out a plain one which must likewise be amongst them and bring it here to me as quickly as thou canst.The girl went to the little house and came to the door. There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her and said Good day my child.The girl gave her no answer and opened the door. Whither away cried the old woman and seized her by the gown and wanted to hold her fast saying That is my house no one can go in there if I choose not to allow it.But the girl was silent got away from her and went straight into the room. Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings which gleamed and glittered before her eyes. She turned them over and looked for the plain one but could not find it. While she was seeking she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away and wanting to get off with a birdcage which she had in her hand.So she went after her and took the cage out of her hand and when she raised it up and looked into it a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill. Then she took the ring and ran quite joyously home with it and thought the little white dove would come and get the ring but it did not.Then she leant against a tree and determined to wait for the dove and as she thus stood it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant and was letting its branches down. And suddenly the branches twined around her and were two arms and when she looked round the tree was a handsome man who embraced and kissed her heartily and said Thou hast delivered me from the power of the old woman who is a wicked witch. She had changed me into a tree and every day for two hours I was a white dove and so long as she possessed the ring I could not regain my human form.Then his servants and his horses who had likewise been changed into trees were freed from the enchantment also and stood beside him. And he led them forth to his kingdom for he was a Kings son and they married and lived happily.
Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him this soon wakened the Lion who placed his huge paw upon him and opened his big jaws to swallow him. Pardon O King cried the little Mouse forgive me this time I shall never forget it who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him that he lifted up his paw and let him go. Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on. Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts. Was I not right said the little Mouse. Little friends may prove great friends.
Long long ago there lived in a village called Keejeejee a woman whose husband died leaving her with a little baby boy. She worked hard all day to get food for herself and child but they lived very poorly and were most of the time halfstarved.When the boy whose name was Mvoo Laana began to get big he said to his mother one day Mother we are always hungry. What work did my father do to support usHis mother replied Your father was a hunter. He set traps and we ate what he caught in them.Oho said Mvoo Laana thats not work thats fun. I too will set traps and see if we cant get enough to eat.The next day he went into the forest and cut branches from the trees and returned home in the evening.The second day he spent making the branches into traps.The third day he twisted cocoanut fiber into ropes.The fourth day he set up as many traps as time would permit.The fifth day he set up the remainder of the traps.The sixth day he went to examine the traps and they had caught so much game beside what they needed for themselves that he took a great quantity to the big town of Oongooja where he sold it and bought corn and other things and the house was full of food and as this good fortune continued he and his mother lived very comfortably.But after a while when he went to his traps he found nothing in them day after day.One morning however he found that an ape had been caught in one of the traps and he was about to kill it when it said Son of Adam I am Neeanee the ape do not kill me. Take me out of this trap and let me go. Save me from the rain that I may come and save you from the sun some day.So Mvoo Laana took him out of the trap and let him go.When Neeanee had climbed up in a tree he sat on a branch and said to the youth For your kindness I will give you a piece of advice Believe me men are all bad. Never do a good turn for a man if you do he will do you harm at the first opportunity.The second day Mvoo Laana found a snake in the same trap. He started to the village to give the alarm but the snake shouted Come back son of Adam dont call the people from the village to come and kill me. I am Neeoka the snake. Let me out of this trap I pray you. Save me from the rain today that I may be able to save you from the sun tomorrow if you should be in need of help.So the youth let him go and as he went he said I will return your kindness if I can but do not trust any man if you do him a kindness he will do you an injury in return at the first opportunity.The third day Mvoo Laana found a lion in the same trap that had caught the ape and the snake and he was afraid to go near it. But the lion said Dont run away I am Simba Kongway the very old lion. Let me out of this trap and I will not hurt you. Save me from the rain that I may save you from the sun if you should need help.So Mvoo Laana believed him and let him out of the trap and Simba Kongway before going his way said Son of Adam you have been kind to me and I will repay you with kindness if I can but never do a kindness to a man or he will pay you back with unkindness.The next day a man was caught in the same trap and when the youth released him he repeatedly assured him that he would never forget the service he had done him in restoring his liberty and saving his life.Well it seemed that he had caught all the game that could be taken in traps and Mvoo Laana and his mother were hungry every day with nothing to satisfy them as they had been before. At last he said to his mother one day Mother make me seven cakes of the little meal we have left and I will go hunting with my bow and arrows. So she baked him the cakes and he took them and his bow and arrows and went into the forest.The youth walked and walked but could see no game and finally he found that he had lost his way and had eaten all his cakes but one.And he went on and on not knowing whether he was going away from his home or toward it until he came to the wildest and most desolate looking wood he had ever seen. He was so wretched and tired that he felt he must lie down and die when suddenly he heard some one calling him and looking up he saw Neeanee the ape who said Son of Adam where are you goingI dont know replied Mvoo Laana sadly Im lost.Well well said the ape dont worry. Just sit down here and rest yourself until I come back and I will repay with kindness the kindness you once showed me.Then Neeanee went away off to some gardens and stole a whole lot of ripe pawpaws and bananas and brought them to Mvoo Laana and said Heres plenty of food for you. Is there anything else you want Would you like a drink And before the youth could answer he ran off with a calabash and brought it back full of water. So the youth ate heartily and drank all the water he needed and then each said to the other Goodbye till we meet again and went their separate ways.When Mvoo Laana had walked a great deal farther without finding which way he should go he met Simba Kongway who asked Where are you going son of AdamAnd the youth answered as dolefully as before I dont know Im lost.Come cheer up said the very old lion and rest yourself here a little. I want to repay with kindness today the kindness you showed me on a former day.So Mvoo Laana sat down. Simba Kongway went away but soon returned with some game he had caught and then he brought some fire and the young man cooked the game and ate it. When he had finished he felt a great deal better and they bade each other goodbye for the present and each went his way. After he had traveled another very long distance the youth came to a farm and was met by a very very old woman who said to him Stranger my husband has been taken very sick and I am looking for some one to make him some medicine. Wont you make it But he answered My good woman I am not a doctor I am a hunter and never used medicine in my life. I can not help you.When he came to the road leading to the principal city he saw a well with a bucket standing near it and he said to himself Thats just what I want. Ill take a drink of nice wellwater. Let me see if the water can be reached.As he peeped over the edge of the well to see if the water was high enough what should he behold but a great big snake which directly it saw him said Son of Adam wait a moment. Then it came out of the well and said How Dont you know meI certainly do not said the youth stepping back a little.Well well said the snake I could never forget you. I am Neeoka whom you released from the trap. You know I said Save me from the rain and I will save you from the sun. Now you are a stranger in the town to which you are going therefore hand me your little bag and I will place in it the things that will be of use to you when you arrive there.So Mvoo Laana gave Neeoka the little bag and he filled it with chains of gold and silver and told him to use them freely for his own benefit. Then they parted very cordially.When the youth reached the city the first man he met was he whom he had released from the trap who invited him to go home with him which he did and the mans wife made him supper.As soon as he could get away unobserved the man went to the sultan and said There is a stranger come to my house with a bag full of chains of silver and gold which he says he got from a snake that lives in a well. But although he pretends to be a man I know that he is a snake who has power to look like a man.When the sultan heard this he sent some soldiers who brought Mvoo Laana and his little bag before him. When they opened the little bag the man who was released from the trap persuaded the people that some evil would come out of it and affect the children of the sultan and the children of the vizir.Then the people became excited and tied the hands of Mvoo Laana behind him.But the great snake had come out of the well and arrived at the town just about this time and he went and lay at the feet of the man who had said all those bad things about Mvoo Laana and when the people saw this they said to that man How is this There is the great snake that lives in the well and he stays by you. Tell him to go away.But Neeoka would not stir. So they untied the young mans hands and tried in every way to make amends for having suspected him of being a wizard.Then the sultan asked him Why should this man invite you to his home and then speak ill of youAnd Mvoo Laana related all that had happened to him and how the ape the snake and the lion had cautioned him about the results of doing any kindness for a man.And the sultan said Although men are often ungrateful they are not always so only the bad ones. As for this fellow he deserves to be put in a sack and drowned in the sea. He was treated kindly and returned evil for good. 
The Story of a Waternymph and an Island LadIn a tiny cottage on the steep rocky hillside of one of the islands of the Azores there lived a poor woman and her only son whose name was Francisco. Every day the boy went fishing in his little boat and every night he brought home fish for his mother to cook for their evening meal and to carry into the market to sell. In this way they lived very comfortably and they loved each other so dearly that they were as happy as happy can be.Francisco with his fair skin blue eyes and thatch of curly golden hair was the handsomest boy in the whole parish and by the time he was sixteen years old there was many a rich mans daughter who had smiled upon him. However the lad thought only of his fishing boat and his mother and did not notice the smiles.One night the moon was so bright that Francisco could not sleep. He awakened his mother who was dozing comfortably in her bed.Im going fishing mother dear he said as he kissed her. The moonlight is calling me.His mother started up from her bed in terror and amazement.Why my boy do you do such a thing as this she asked. You have never been fishing in the night before. Some evil will surely befall you.Dont worry about me dear mother replied Francisco laughing at her fears. I know how to take care of myself. It is as light as day. Think how many fish Ill bring back for you to sell in the market tomorrow.His mother shook her head anxiously but with another loving kiss the lad ran out into the bright moonlight. He quickly launched his little fishing boat and soon was floating smoothly along on the peaceful waters of the bay which gleamed like a silver pathway in the moonlight. The soft air the gentle rocking of the little boat and the face of the moon upon which his blue eyes were fixed combined to send sleep to his eyelids. Soon he was nodding in the little boat. A few moments later and he was fast asleep. The moons rays upon his curls made them shine as if they were indeed made of gold.Now the village maidens were not the only ones who had noticed Franciscos blue eyes and handsome face. A waternymph who dwelt in the depths of the sea had often observed him. In the daytime she was invisible to the eye of humans and so the lad had never seen her though she often spent long hours near him never taking her eyes from his face.Here comes the beautiful youth in his little fishing boat cried the nymph as she saw the moonlight gleaming upon his bright curls. At last my wish has come true. Now at night hell be able to see me.She hastily arranged her own beautiful hair before a little mirror she carried. Some of the strands of priceless pearls which decked her lovely head were a trifle awry. These and the necklaces of rare pearls which hung about her fair throat surrounded her with a gleam of soft light almost like the light of the moon. As she approached nearer to the little boat she saw that Francisco was fast asleep. She swam in the direction of the lad with all possible speed a wild terror in her eyes.What madness is this she asked as she looked down upon his bowed head. This frail boat will drift upon the dangerous rocks and be dashed to pieces. Ill take him home to my own palace without awakening him. Perhaps when he sees how lovely it is hell even like me a little bit.Just for a moment she hesitated thinking how far from home Francisco would be in the palace of motherofpearl in the depths of the sea.The rocks are really very dangerous she said to herself as she gently drew his sleeping form into her arms.The next morning Franciscos empty fishing boat was found by the fishermen. For hours his mother had watched in vain for his return. When at last she heard that the empty boat had been found she was nearly wild with grief.He was the best son a mother ever had she moaned over and over again. How can I live without himIndeed as the days and weeks went by it was increasingly difficult for the poor woman to live. She not only missed her boys loving smile but she also missed the fish he caught so skillfully. There was little for the poor woman to eat if she had any appetite for food.Why dont you go to the Wiseman of the Sea and tell him your troubles asked one of the neighbors.Franciscos mother knew that it was a long and difficult journey to reach the Wiseman of the Sea. She decided however it would be worth the effort just to gaze into his wise eyes. He knew so much perhaps he would know how to say something to comfort her in her great sorrow and loneliness. She had shrugged her shoulders when her neighbor had spoken of it but she could not get the idea out of her mind. She knew that she would never rest in peace until she had made this journey. Accordingly she launched Franciscos fishing boat and thanks to smooth seas reached the little rocky island in the midst of the sea where the Wiseman of the Sea lived.His tall form was outlined above the cliff even as she tied her little boat. He was very tall far taller than anybody she had ever seen and his snowwhite beard fell to his feet. He was clothed in fish scales which gleamed in the sunlight.Well little mother what can I do for you today he asked as she came up the path to the summit of the rock.The eyes of the Wiseman of the Sea were very kind as well as full of great wisdom. Franciscos mother forgot to be afraid of him as she had expected to be. She told him the story of her lost son. The Wiseman listened carefully to her words and then he saidGood mother I am glad to tell you that I know where your Francisco is. He is in the power of a waternymph who has carried him away to her castle of motherofpearl in the depths of the sea.Franciscos mother felt the tears of joy well up into her eyes. Is my boy happy there and is he well she asked eagerly.He is entirely well and happy. The waternymph gave him a philtre which has made him forget his past life entirely.Im glad you told me that said the boys mother. I was just wondering how my dear lad could be happy while he was causing me so much sorrow. He has always been the best and kindest son with which a mother ever was blessed.The Wiseman of the Sea started to say something but the woman interrupted as a new thought flew into her mind. Tell me she cried is there no way of getting him back With all your wisdom cant you think of some way to make him once more remember the mother who loves him and the little home in which we have passed so many happy days together Do you not know some means of breaking the power which this waternymph has over himThe Wiseman looked out across the sea in silence for at least a minute and a half. He thought hard. Franciscos mother watched him with eager eyes. She could hardly wait for his answer. At last these were the words which fell from his lipsYou have shed many tears good woman but tears are still to flow if you are to bring back your son.Oh must I suffer more cried the heartbroken mother. It seems that I have already lived a lifetime since my dear lad kissed me in the moonlight. I have endured all that I can bear.The Wiseman smiled gently as he raised his hand. Listen my child he said. Your tears must be shed upon the bosom of the waters. If perchance one of them should fall upon your sons heart there in the palace of the waternymph in the depths of the sea the power of her philtre will be broken.Ill shed whole oceans of tears if I can break the power of that waternymph and bring back my Francisco said his mother.The fact is that she began to shed tears then and there even before she had thanked the Wiseman of the Sea for what he had told her.Now it happened that Francisco had grown to love the beautiful palace of motherofpearl in the depths of the sea. He never tired of all its beauty. About the palace there were lovely gardens filled with flowers made of precious gems. Each tiny bud of that garden was worth a kings ransom so rich were the jewels which composed it. The waternymph often gathered her arms full of these rare blossoms and wove them into a garland to crown Franciscos golden curls. He never had a thought of the old life at home with his mother so completely had the nymphs philtre done its work.There was always a big fish swimming about the palace. On its back there was a cushion of seagreen satin embroidered with lovely pearls.This is your riding horse said the waternymph to Francisco the first day he had seen it. If you should ever get tired of the palace and find the life here a bit monotonous just mount this horse and ride about for a little.The waternymph had shaken out her long fair tresses so that they covered as much as possible of the fishtail she had instead of feet. She was very sensitive about the fact that she had no feet upon which to wear pretty little slippers like those of the maidens she had seen so often as they called out gay greetings to the handsome fisherlad.Francisco had smiled into her eyes. How absurd he cried to think of such a thing as getting tired of this wonderful placeIn fact the days had slipped by all too fast for the happy youth. Then it suddenly happened one day while the waternymph was asleep that he thought of his mother the little house which had been his home for sixteen years and more the fishing boat which was his pride and joy the moonlight night when he had gaily kissed his mothers cheek and gone away never to return. He did not stop to waken the sleeping nymph. He said no word to the servants of the palace. He thought only of the fish with the cushion of seagreen satin embroidered with rare pearls.Quick he cried to it. Take me home as fast as you can My mothers heart is breaking She has shed so many tears for me I know that by this time she may be entirely blind.In another hour Francisco was safe at home with his mothers arms about him. She had shed so many tears that her eyes were swollen almost shut but they were not closed so completely that they could not shine with the great joy which once more filled her heart.Promise me one thing she said to him. Give me your word that youll never go fishing again. I dont trust that waternymph even in the daytime.Accordingly Francisco gave up being a fisherman and became a hunter. To make his spears he gathered the young sapling which grew on the hillside even down to the edge of the water. He had grown still handsomer while he had lived in the palace of motherofpearl in the depths of the sea and there were twice as many pretty maidens who cast smiling glances in his direction.It was the daughter of the rich man of the village who at last won the heart of Francisco. When he went awooing however he had no gift to take except the birds he had killed with his own hand. The rich man laughed at him. These were his wordsWhen my daughter marries it shall be only to a youth who can bring her rich gifts.Francisco went away with a sad heart and sat upon the rocks at the edge of the sea gazing out over the water with eyes so full of tears that they saw nothing.The waternymph was not far away from the shore those days. She was always seeking for a glimpse of the golden head which she had so often crowned with flowers. Her joy now at the sight of him was buried by her sorrow when she saw that his heart was full of woe. She knew at once the cause of his grief.The next morning when Francisco went to get wood to make a new spear he found a necklace of priceless pearls lying on the shore. It was the gift of the waternymph but since his heart had been touched by his mothers tears he had entirely forgotten her. He took the gift to the maid he loved with never a thought of the giver.
The Monkey with the TomTomIn a remote wood there lived a monkey and one day while he was eating woodapples a sharp thorn from the tree ran into the tip of his tail he tried his best to get it out but could not. So he proceeded to the nearest village and calling the barber asked him to oblige him by removing the thorn.Friend barber said the monkey a thorn has run into my tail. Kindly remove it and I will reward you.The barber took up his razor and began to examine the tail but as he was cutting out the thorn he cut off the tip of the tail. The monkey was greatly enraged and saidFriend barber give me back my tail. If you cannot do that give me your razor.The barber was now in a difficulty and as he could not replace the tip of the tail he had to give up his razor to the monkey.The monkey went back to the wood with his razor thus trickishly acquired. On the way he met an old woman who was cutting fuel from a driedup tree.Grandmother grandmother said the monkey the tree is very hard. You had better use this sharp razor and you will cut your fuel easily.The poor woman was very pleased and took the razor from the monkey. In cutting the wood she of course blunted the razor and the monkey seeing his razor thus spoiled saidGrandmother you have spoiled my razor. So you must either give me your fuel or get me a better razor.The woman was not able to procure another razor. So she gave the monkey her fuel and returned to her house bearing no load that day.The roguish monkey now put the bundle of dry fuel on his head and proceeded to a village to sell it. There he met an old woman seated by the roadside and making puddings. Said the monkey to herGrandmother grandmother you are making puddings and your fuel is already exhausted. Use mine also and make more cakes.The old lady thanked him for his kindness and used his fuel for her puddings. The cunning monkey waited till the last stick of his fuel was burnt up and then he said to the old womanGrandmother grandmother return me my fuel or give me all your puddings.She was unable to return him the fuel and so had to give him all her puddings.The monkey with the basket of puddings on his head walked and walked till he met a Paraiya coming with a tomtom towards him.Brother Paraiya said the monkey I have a basketful of puddings to give you. Will you in return present me with your tomtomThe Paraiya gladly agreed as he was then very hungry and had nothing with him to eat.The monkey now ascended with the tomtom to the topmost branch of a big tree and there beat his drum most triumphantly saying in honour of his several tricksI lost my tail and got a razor um um.I lost my razor and got a bundle of fuel um um.I lost my fuel and got a basket of puddings um um.I lost my puddings and got a tomtom um um.Thus there are rogues in this innocent world who live to glory over their wicked tricks.
An old woman lived with her grandson in a small hut. She had no husband to take care of her and the boy and they were very poor. The lads clothing was made of the skins of birds which they caught in snares. Whenever the boy came out of the hut to play the other boys would call Here comes the bird boy Fly away birdie and the men would laugh at him and tear his clothes.Only one man whose name was Kiviung was kind to the boy and tried to protect him from the others but they would not stop. The lad often came to his grandmother crying and she would console him and promise him a new garment as soon as they could get the skins.She begged the men to stop teasing the child and tearing his clothes but they only laughed at her. At last she became angry and said to the boy I will avenge you on your tormentors. I can do it by making use of my power to conjure.She poured water on the mud floor and said Step into this puddle and do not be frightened at anything that happens.He stepped into it and immediately the earth opened and he sank out of sight but the next moment he rose near the beach and swam about as a young seal with a wonderfully smooth shining skin.Some one saw him and called out that there was a yearling seal close to shore. The men all ran to their kayaks eager to secure the beautiful creature. But the boyseal swam lustily away as his grandmother had told him to do and the men continued to pursue him. Whenever he rose to the surface to breathe he took care to come up behind the kayaks where he would splash and dabble in order to lure them on. As soon as he had attracted their attention and they had turned to pursue him he would dive and come up farther out in the sea. The men were so interested in catching him that they did not observe how they were being led far out into the ocean and out of sight of the land.It was now that the grandmother put forth her powers. Suddenly a fierce gale arose the sea foamed and roared and the waves upset their frail vessels and plunged them under the surface. When they were drowned the little seal changed back into a boy and walked home over the water without wetting his feet. There was no one left now to torment him.Kiviung who had never abused the boy had gone out with the rest but his kayak did not capsize. Bravely he strove against the wild waves and drifted far away from the place where the others had gone down. There was a dense fog and he could not tell in which direction to go.He rowed for many days not knowing whither he was going and then one day he spied through the mists a dark mass which he took to be land. As he pulled toward it the sea became more and more tempestuous and he saw that what he had supposed to be a rocky cliff on an island was a wild black sea with a raging whirlpool in the midst of it.He had come so close that it was only by the utmost exertion he escaped being drawn into the whirlpool and carried down. He put forth all his strength and at last got away where the waves were less like mountains. But he had to be constantly on the alert for at one moment his frail craft was carried high up on the crest of billows and the next it was plunged into a deep trough of the sea.Again he saw a dark mass looming up and rowed toward it hoping to find land but again he was deceived for it was another whirlpool which made the sea rise in gigantic waves. At last the wind subsided and the sea became less rough though the whitecaps still frothed around him. The fog lifted and at a great distance he saw land real land this time.He went toward it and after rowing along the coast for some distance he spied a stone house with a light in it. You may be sure he was delighted to come near a human habitation again. He landed and entered the house. There was no one in it but one old woman. She received him kindly and helped him to pull off his boots and she hung his wet stockings on the frame above the lamp. Then she saidI will make a fire in the next room and cook a good supper.Kiviung thought she was a very good woman and he was so hungry that he could scarcely wait for the supper. It seemed to him that she was a long time preparing it. When his stockings were dry he tried to take them from the frame in order to put them on. But as soon as he touched the frame it rose up out of his reach. He tried in vain several times and each time the frame rose up. He called the woman in and asked her to give him his stockings.Take them yourself she said. There they are there they are and went out again.Kiviung was surprised at the change in her manner. He tried once more to take hold of his stockings but with no better result. Calling the woman in again he explained his difficulty and saidPlease hand me my boots and stockings they slip away from me.Sit down where I sat when you entered my house then you can get them she replied and left the room.He tried once more but the frame arose as before and he could not reach it. He knew now that she was a wicked woman and he suspected that the big fire she had made was prepared so she could roast and eat him.What should he do He had seen that she could work magic. He knew that he could not escape unless he could surpass her in her own arts. He summoned his mascot which was a huge white bear. At once there was a low growl from under the house. The woman did not hear it at first but Kiviung kept on conjuring the spirit and it rose right up through the floor roaring loudly. Then the old witch rushed in trembling with fear and gave Kiviung what he had asked for.Here are your boots she cried here are your slippers here are your stockings. I will help you put them on.But Kiviung would not stay any longer with the horrid creature and dared not wait to put on his stockings and boots. He rushed out of the house and had barely gotten out of the door when it clapped violently together catching the tail of his jacket which was torn off. Without stopping to look behind he ran to his kayak and paddled away.The old woman quickly recovered from her fear and came out swinging a glittering knife which she attempted to throw at him. He was so frightened that he nearly upset his kayak but he steadied it and arose to his feet lifting his spear.I shall kill you with my spear he cried.At that the old woman fell down in terror and broke her knife which she had made by magic out of a thin slab of ice.He traveled on for many days always keeping near the shore. At last he came to another hut and again a lamp was burning inside. His clothing was wet and he was hungry so he landed and went into the house. There he found something very strange a woman living all alone with her daughter Yet the daughter was married and they kept the soninlaw in the house. But he was a log of driftwood which they had found on the beach. It had four branches like legs and arms. Every day about the time of low water they carried it to the beach and when the tide came in it swam away. When night came it returned with eight large seals two being fastened to each bough.Thus the log provided food for its wife her mother and Kiviung and they lived in abundance. Kiviung became rested and refreshed after his weary travels and he enjoyed this life so well that he remained for a long time. One day however after they had launched the log as they had always done it floated away and never came back.Then Kiviung went sealing every day for himself and the women and he was so successful that they wished him to remain with them always. But he had not forgotten the home he had left long ago and meant to return to it. He was anxious to lay in a good stock of mittens to keep his hands warm on the long journey and each night he pretended to have lost the pair he wore and the women would make him another pair from the skin of the seals he brought home. He hid them all in the hood of his jacket.Then one day he too floated off with the tide and never came back. He rowed on for many days and nights always following the shore. During the terrible storm he had been out of sight of land all he ever cared to be.At last he came again to a hut where a lamp was burning and went to it. But this time he thought it would be well to see who was inside before entering. He therefore climbed up to the window and looked through the peephole. On the bed sat a woman whose head and whose hands looked like big yellowandblack spiders. She was sewing and when she saw the dark shadow before the window she at first thought it was a cloud but when she looked up and beheld a man she grasped a big knife and arose looking very angry. Kiviung waited to see no more. He felt a sudden longing for home and hastily went on his way.Again he traveled for days and nights. At last he came to a land which seemed familiar and as he went farther he recognized his own country. He was very glad to see some boats ahead of him and when he stood up and waved and shouted to them they came to meet him. They had been on a whaling excursion and were towing a large dead whale to their village.In the bow of one of the boats stood a stout young man who had harpooned the whale. He looked at Kiviung keenly and Kiviung looked at him. Then of a sudden they recognized each other. It was Kiviungs own son whom he had left a small boy but who was now become a grown man and a great hunter.Kiviungs wife was delighted to see him whom she had supposed dead. At first she seemed glad and then she seemed troubled. She had taken a new husband but after thinking it over she returned to Kiviung and they were very happy.
A Nobleman announced his intention of giving a public entertainment in the theatre and offered splendid prizes to all who had any novelty to exhibit at the performance. The announcement attracted a crowd of conjurers jugglers and acrobats and among the rest a Clown very popular with the crowd who let it be known that he was going to give an entirely new turn. When the day of the performance came the theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the entertainment began. Several performers exhibited their tricks and then the popular favourite came on emptyhanded and alone.At once there was a hush of expectation and he letting his head fall upon his breast imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the audience insisted on his producing the animal which they said he must have somewhere concealed about his person. He however convinced them that there was no pig there and then the applause was deafening. Among the spectators was a Countryman who disparaged the Clowns performance and announced that he would give a much superior exhibition of the same trick on the following day. Again the theatre was filled to overflowing and again the Clown gave his imitation amidst the cheers of the crowd. The Countryman meanwhile before going on the stage had secreted a young porker under his smock and when the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could he gave it a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly. But they all with one voice shouted out that the Clowns imitation was much more true to life. Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said sarcastically There that shows what sort of judges you are
Once upon a time a lad who tended the cattle in the wood was eating his noontide meal in a clearing in the forest. As he was sitting there he saw a rat run into a juniperbush. His curiosity led him to look for it but as he bent over down he went head over heels and fell asleep. And he dreamed that he was going to find the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen but that he did not know the way.The following day he once more pastured his cattle in the wood when he came to the same clearing and again ate his dinner there. And again he saw the rat and went to look for it and again when he bent down he went head over heels and fell fast asleep. And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen and that in order to get her he would need seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes. He awoke and it was all a dream but by now he had made up his mind to find the Mount of the Golden Queen and he went home with his herd. On the third day when he led out his cattle he could not reach the clearing of his happy dream too soon. Again the rat showed itself and when he went to look for it he fell asleep as he had done each preceding day. And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen and that she came to him and laid a letter and a band of gold in his pocket. Then he awoke and to his indescribable surprise he found in his pocket both of the things of which he had dreamed the letter and the band. Now he had no time to attend to the cattle any longer but drove them straight home. Then he went into the stable led out a horse sold it and bought seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes with the money. He made the tholepins out of the iron put on his iron shoes and set forth. For a time he traveled by land but at last he came to the lake which he had to cross. He saw naught but water before and behind him and rowing so long and steadily that he wore out one tholepin after another he at length reached land and a green meadow where no trees grew. He walked all around the meadow and at last found a mound of earth from which smoke was rising. When he looked more closely out came a woman who was nine yards long. He asked her to tell him the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. But she replied That I do not know. Go ask my sister who is nine yards taller than I am and who lives in an earthmound which you can find without any trouble.So he left her and came to a mound of earth that looked just like the first and from which smoke was also rising. A woman at once came out who was tremendously tall and of her he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. That I do not know said she. Go ask my brother who is nine yards taller than I am and who lives in a hill a little further away.So he came to the hill from which smoke was also rising and knocked. A man at once came out who was a veritable giant for he was twentyseven yards in length and of him he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. Then the giant took a whistle and whistled in every direction to call together all the animals to be found on the earth. And all the animals came from the woods foremost among them a bear.The giant asked him about the Mount of the Golden Queen but he knew nothing of it. Again the giant blew his whistle in every direction to call together all the fishes to be found in the waters. They came at once and he asked them about the Mount of the Golden Queen but they knew nothing of it. Once more the giant blew his whistle in every direction and called together all the birds of the air. They came and he asked the eagle about the Mount of the Golden Queen and whether he knew where it might be.The eagle said Yes Well then take this lad there said the giant but do not treat him unkindly This the eagle promised allowed the youth to seat himself on his back and then off they were through the air over fields and forests hill and dale and before long they were above the ocean and could see nothing but sky and water. Then the eagle dipped the youth in the ocean up to his ankles and asked Are you afraid No said the youth. Then the eagle flew on a while and again dipped the youth into the water up to his knees and said Are you afraid Yes answered the youth but the giant said you were not to treat me unkindly. Are you really afraid asked the eagle once more. Yes answered the youth. Then the eagle said The fear you now feel is the very same fear I felt when the princess thrust the letter and the golden band into your pocket.And with that they had reached a large high mountain in one side of which was a great iron door. They knocked and a servingmaid appeared to open the door and admit them. The youth remained and was well received but the eagle said farewell and flew back to his native land. The youth asked for a drink and he was at once handed a beaker containing a refreshing draught. When he had emptied it and returned the beaker he let the golden band drop into it. And when the maid brought back the beaker to her mistresswho was the princess of the Mount of the Golden Queenthe latter looked into the beaker and behold there lay a golden band which she recognized as her own. So she asked Is there some one here and when the maid answered in the affirmative the princess said Bid him come in And as soon as the youth entered she asked him if he chanced to have a letter. The youth drew out the letter he had received in so strange a manner and gave it to the princess. And when she had read it she cried full of joy Now I am delivered And at that very moment the mountain turned into a most handsome castle with all sorts of precious things servants and every sort of convenience each for its own purpose. Whether the princess and the youth married the story does not say yet we must take for granted that a wedding is the proper end for the fairytale.
One morning when big white clouds were shouldering each others shoulders rolling on the rollers of a big blue sky Blixie Bimber came along where the Potato Face Blind Man sat shining the brass bicker jiggers on his accordion. Do you like to shine up the brass bicker jiggers asked Blixie.Yes he answered. One time a long time ago the brass bickerjiggers were gold but they stole the gold away when I wasnt looking. He blinked the eyelids over his eyeballs and said I thank them because they took gold they wanted. Brass feels good to my fingers the same as gold. And he went on shining up the brass bickerjiggers on the accordion humming a little line of an old song Tomorrow will never catch up with yesterday because yesterday started sooner.Seems like a nice morning with the sun spilling bushels of sunshine he said to Blixie who answered Big white clouds are shoulder ing each others shoulders rolling on the rollers of a big blue sky. Seems like its April all over again he murmured almost like he wasnt talking at all. Seems just that wayApril all over again murmured Blixie almost like she wasnt talking at all.So they began drifting the old man drifting his way the girl drifting her way till he drifted into a story. And the story he told was like this and in these words Deep Red Roses was a lovely girl with blue skylights like the blue skylights of early April in her eyes. And her lips reminded people of deep red roses waiting in the cool of the summer evening. She met Shoulder Straps one day when she was young yet. He promised her. And she promised him. But he went away. One of the long wars between two short wars took him. In a far away country then he married another girl. And he didnt come back to Deep Red Roses.Next came High High Over one day when she was young yet. A dancer he was going from one city to another city to dance spending his afternoons and evenings and late  and nights dancing and sleeping in the morning till noon. And when he promised she promised. But he went away to another city and after that another city. And he married one woman and then another woman. Every year there came a new story about one of the new wives of High High Over the dancer. And while she was young yet Deep Red Roses forgot all about her promise and the promise of High High Over the dancer who ran away from her.Six Bits was the next to come along. And he was not a soldier nor a dancer nor anything special. He was a careless man changing from one job to another changing from paper hanging to plastering from fixing shingle roofs where the shingles were ripped to opening cans with can openers. Six Bits gave Deep Red Roses his promise and she gave him her promise. But he was always late keeping his promise. When the wedding was to be Tuesday he didnt come till Wednesday. If it was Friday he came Saturday. And there wasnt any wedding.So Deep Red Roses said to herself ll am going away and learn I am going away and talk with the wives of High High Over the dancer and maybe if I go far enough I will find the wife of Shoulder Straps the soldier and maybe the wives of the men who promised me will tell me how to keep promises kept. She packed her baggage till her baggage was packed so full there was room for only one more thing. So she had to decide whether to put a clock or whether to put a looking glass in her baggage. My head tells me to carry the clock so I can always tell if I am early or late she said to herself. But my heart tells me to carry a looking glass so I can look at my face and tell if I am getting older or younger. At last she decides to take the clock and and leave the looking glassbecause her head says so. She starts away. She goes through the door she is out of the house she goes to the street she starts up the street. Then her heart tells her to go back and change the clock for the looking glass. She goes back up the street through the door into the house into her room. Now she stands in front of the clock and the looking glass saying Tonight I sleep home here one more night and tomorrow morning I decide again.And now every morning Deep Red Roses decides with her head to take the clock. She takes the clock and starts away and then comes back because her heart decides she must have the looking glass. If you go to her house this morning you will see her standing in the doorway with blue skylights like the blue sky of early April in her eyes and lips that remind you of deep red roses in the cool of the evening in summer.You will see her leave the doorway and go out of the gate with the clock in her hands. Then if you wait you will see her come back through the gate into the door back to her room where she puts down the clock and takes up the looking glass. After that she decides to wait until to morrow morning to decide again what to decide. Her head tells her one thing her heart tells her another. Between the two she stays home. Sometimes she looks at her face in the looking glass and says to herself I am young yet and while I am young I am going to do my own deciding.Blixie Bimber fingered the end of her chin with her little finger and said It is a strange story. It has a stab in it. It would hurt me if I couldnt look up at the big white clouds shouldering their shoulders rolling on the rollers of the big blue sky.It is a good story to tell when April is here all over againand I am shining up the brass bickerjiggers on my accordion said the Potato Face Blind Man.
Now it once happened that one of the kings herdsmen had three sons. Two of these lads were supposed to be very sharpwitted while the youngest was thought to be very stupid indeed. The elder sons helped their father to look after the flocks and herds while the fool so they called him was good for nothing but sleeping and amusing himself.He would pass whole days and nights slumbering peacefully on the stove only getting off when forced to by others or when he was too warm and wished to lie on the other side or when hungry and thirsty he wanted food and drink.His father had no love for him and called him a neerdowell. His brothers often tormented him by dragging him off the stove and taking away his foodindeed he would many a time have gone hungry if his mother had not been good to him and fed him on the quiet. She caressed him fondly for why should he suffer thought she if he does happen to have been born a fool Besides who can understand the ways of God It sometimes happens that the wisest men are not happy while the foolish when harmless and gentle lead contented lives.One day on their return from the fields the fools two brothers dragged him off the stove and taking him into the yard where they gave him a sound thrashing they turned him out of the house saying Go fool and lose no time for you shall have neither food nor lodging until you bring us a basket of mushrooms from the wood.The poor lad was so taken by surprise he hardly understood what his brothers wanted him to do. After pondering for a while he made his way towards a small oak forest where everything seemed to have a strange and marvellous appearance so strange that he did not recognise the place. As he walked he came to a small dead treestump on the top of which he placed his cap saying Every tree here raises its head to the skies and wears a good cap of leaves but you my poor friend are bareheaded you will die of cold. You must be among your brothers as I am among minea born fool. Take then my cap. And throwing his arms round the dead stump he wept and embraced it tenderly. At that moment an oak which stood near began to walk towards him as if it were alive. The poor fellow was frightened and about to run away but the oak spake like a human being and said Do not fly stop a moment and listen to me. This withered tree is my son and up to this time no one has grieved for his dead youth but me. You have now watered him with your tears and in return for your sympathy you shall henceforward have anything you ask of me on pronouncing these wordsO Oak Tree so green and with acorns of goldYour friendship to prove I will tryIn Heavens good name now to beg Ill make boldMy needs then oh kindly supply.At the same moment a shower of golden acorns fell. The fool filled his pockets thanked the oak and bowing to her returned home.Well stupid where are the mushrooms cried one of his brothers.I have some mushrooms off the oak in my pockets.Eat them yourself then for you will get nothing else you goodfornothing. What have you done with your capI put it on a poor stump of a tree that stood by the wayside for its head was uncovered and I was afraid it might freeze.He then scrambled on to the top of the stove and as he lay down some of the golden acorns fell out of his pocket. So bright were they they shone like sunbeams in the room. In spite of the fools entreaties the brothers picked them up and gave them to their father who hastened to present them to the king telling him that his idiot son had gathered them in the wood. The king immediately sent a detachment of his guards to the forest to find the oak which bore golden acorns. But their efforts were fruitless for though they hunted in every nook and corner of the forest they found not a single oak that bore acorns of gold.At first the king was very angry but when he grew calmer he sent for his herdsman and said to him Tell your son the fool that he must bring me by this evening a cask filled to the brim with these precious golden acorns. If he obeys my commands you shall never lack bread and salt and you may rest assured that my royal favour will not fail you in time of need.The herdsman gave his youngest son the kings message.The king I see he replied is fond of a good bargain he does not ask he commandsand insists upon a fool fetching him acorns of solid gold in return for promises made of air. No I shall not go.And neither prayers nor threats were of the slightest avail to make him change his mind. At last his brothers pulled him forcibly off the stove put his coat on him and a new cap and dragged him into the yard where they gave him a good beating and drove him away saying Now you stupid lose no time be off and be quick. If you return without the golden acorns you shall have neither supper nor bed.What was the poor fellow to do For a long time he wept then crossing himself he went in the direction of the forest. He soon reached the dead stump upon which his cap still rested and going up to the mother oak said to herO Oak Tree so green and with acorns of goldIn my helplessness I to thee cryIn Heavens great name now to beg I make boldMy pressing needs pray satisfy.The oak moved and shook its branches but instead of golden acorns a tablecloth fell into the fools hands. And the tree said Keep this cloth always in your possession and for your own use. When you want a benefit by it you need only sayO Tablecloth who for the poorThe hungry and thirsty makes cheerMay he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.When it had uttered these words the oak ceased to speak and the fool thanking her bowed and turned towards home. On his way he wondered to himself how he should tell his brothers and what they would say but above all he thought how his good mother would rejoice to see the feastgiving tablecloth. When he had walked about half the distance he met an old beggar who said to him See what a sick and ragged old man I am for the love of God give me a little money or some bread.The fool spread his tablecloth on the grass and inviting the beggar to sit down saidO Tablecloth who for the poorThe hungry and thirsty makes cheerMay he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.Then a whistling was heard in the air and overhead something shone brightly. At the same instant a table spread as for a royal banquet appeared before them. Upon it were many different kinds of food flasks of mead and glasses of the choicest wine. The plate was of gold and silver.The fool and the beggar man crossed themselves and began to feast. When they had finished the whistling was again heard and everything vanished. The fool folded up his tablecloth and went on his way. But the old man said If you will give me your tablecloth you shall have this wand in exchange. When you say certain words to it it will set upon the person or persons pointed out and give them such a thrashing that to get rid of it they will give you anything they possess.The fool thought of his brothers and exchanged the tablecloth for the wand after which they both went on their respective ways.Suddenly the fool remembered that the oak had ordered him to keep the tablecloth for his own use and that by parting with it he had lost the power of giving his mother an agreeable surprise. So he said to the wandThou selfpropelling ever willing fighting WandRun quick and bringMy feastproviding tablecloth back to my handThy praise Ill sing.The wand went off like an arrow after the old man quickly overtook him and throwing itself upon him began to beat him dreadfully crying out in a loud voiceFor others goods you seem to have a likingStop thief or sure your back Ill keep on striking.The poor beggar tried to run away but it was of no use for the wand followed him striking all the time and repeating the same words over and over again. So in spite of his anxiety to keep the tablecloth he was forced to throw it away and flee.The wand brought the cloth back to the fool who again went on his way towards home thinking of the surprise in store for his mother and brothers. He had not gone very far when a traveller carrying an empty wallet accosted him saying For the love of God give me a small coin or a morsel of food for my bag is empty and I am very hungry. I have too a long journey before me.The fool again spread his tablecloth on the grass and saidO Tablecloth who for the poorThe hungry and thirsty makes cheerMay he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.A whistling was heard in the air something shone brightly overhead and a table spread as for a royal feast placed itself before them. It was laid with a numerous variety of dishes hydromel and costly wines. The fool and his guest sat down crossed themselves and ate to their hearts content. When they had finished whistling was again heard and everything vanished. The fool folded the cloth up carefully and was about to continue his journey when the traveller said Will you exchange your tablecloth for my waistband When you say to it certain words it will turn into a deep lake upon which you may float at will. The words run thusO marvellous wonderful lakeforming BandFor my safety and not for my funBear me in a boat on thy waves far from landSo that I from my foes need not run.The fool thought his father would find it very convenient always to have water at hand for the kings flocks so he gave his tablecloth in exchange for the belt which he wound round his loins and taking the wand in his hand they went off in opposite directions. After a little while the fool began to reflect on what the oak had told him about keeping the tablecloth for his own use and he remembered too that he was depriving himself of the power of giving his mother a pleasant surprise. Thereupon he said the magic words to his wandThou selfpropelling ever willing fighting WandRun quick and bringMy feastproviding tablecloth back to my handThy praise Ill sing.The wand at once started in pursuit of the poor traveller whom it began to beat at the same time crying outFor others goods you seem to have a likingStop thief or sure your back Ill keep on striking.The man was scared out of his wits and tried to escape the wands blows but it was of no use so he was forced to throw the tablecloth away and run at the top of his speed. The wand brought the tablecloth back to his master. The latter hid it under his coat rearranged the waistband and taking the faithful wand in his hand again went towards home. As he walked he rejoiced to think of the pleasure he should have in exercising the wand on his wicked brothers of his fathers satisfaction when by the help of the waistband he could always have water for the kings flocks even in the driest weather and of his mothers joy on witnessing the wonders of the feastgiving tablecloth. These pleasant thoughts were interrupted by a soldier lame clothed in rags and covered with wounds. He had once been a famous warrior.I am pursued by misfortunes said he to the fool. I was once a brave soldier and fought valiantly in my youth. Now I am lamed for life and on this lonely road have found no one to give me a morsel of food. Have pity on me and give me a little bread.The fool sat down on the grass and spreading out his tablecloth saidO Tablecloth who for the poorThe hungry and thirsty makes cheerMay he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.A whistling was heard in the air something bright shone overhead and then before them stood a table spread as for a royal feast loaded with dainty dishes mead and costly wines. When they had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted the whistling was again heard and then everything vanished.The fool was folding up his tablecloth when the soldier saidWill you give me your tablecloth in exchange for this sixhorned helmet It will fire itself off and instantly destroy the object pointed out. You have but to turn it round on your head and repeat these wordsO Magic Helmet never thouDost want for powder nor shotAllay my fears and fire nowJust where I point. Fail not.You will see that it fires off immediately and even if your enemy were a mile away he would fall.The fool was delighted with the idea and thought how useful such a hat would be in any sudden danger it would even serve him to defend his country the king or himself. So he handed the tablecloth to the soldier put the helmet on his head took his wand in his hand and again set his face towards home.When he had gone some distance and the soldier was almost out of sight he began to think of what the oak had said about not parting with the tablecloth and of how his dear mother could not now enjoy the pleasant surprise he had been dreaming about. So he said to the wandThou selfpropelling ever willing fighting WandRun quick and bringMy feastproviding tablecloth back to my handThy praise Ill sing.The wand dashed after the soldier and having reached him began to beat him crying outFor others goods you seem to have a likingStop thief or sure your back Ill keep on striking.The soldier was still a powerful man and in spite of his wound turned right about face intending to give blow for blow. But the wand was too much for him and he soon found resistance useless. So overcome by pain rather than fear he threw away the tablecloth and took to his heels.The faithful wand brought the tablecloth back to his master who glad to have it again once more turned towards home.He soon left the forest crossed the fields and came in sight of his fathers house. At a little distance therefrom his brothers met him and said crossly Well stupid where are the golden acornsThe fool looked at them and laughed in their faces. Then he said to his wandO selfpropelling ever willing fighting WandStrike with thy usual fireMy everscolding teasing worrying brother bandFor they have roused my ire.The wand needed no second bidding and darting out of his hand began to thrash the brothers soundly crying out like a reasoning creatureYour brother has often your blows felt alackNow taste it yourselves hope you like it whack whack.The brothers were overpowered and felt all the while as if boiling water were being poured over their heads. Yelling with pain they began to run at full speed and soon disappeared with clouds of dust flying round them.The wand then came back to the fools hand. He went into the house climbed on the stove and told his mother all that had happened. Then he criedO Tablecloth who for the poorThe hungry and thirsty makes cheerLet us within our cottage doorFeed off you without stint or fear.A whistling was heard in the air something bright shone overhead and then a table laid as for a royal banquet was placed before them covered with dainty meats glasses and bottles of mead and wine. The whole service was of gold and silver. As the fool and his mother were about to begin the feast the herdsman entered. He stopped dumb with amazement but when invited to partake began to eat and drink with great enjoyment.At the end of the meal the whistling was again heard and everything vanished completely.The herdsman set off in hot haste to the court to tell the king of this new marvel. Thereupon his majesty sent one of his heroes in search of the fool whom he found stretched on the stove.If you value your life listen and obey the kings orders said the paladin. He commands you to send him by me your tablecloth then you shall have your share of his royal favour. But if not you will always remain a poor fool and will moreover be treated as a refractory prisoner. We teach them how to behave you understandOh yes I understand. And then he pronounced the magic wordsO selfpropelling ever willing fighting WandGo soundly thrash that manThe most deceiving dangerous wretch in all the landSo hurt him all you can.The wand sprang from the fools hand with the speed of lightning and struck the paladin three times in the face. He immediately fled but the wand was after him hitting him all the time and crying outMere promises are childrens playSo do not throw your breath awayBut think of something true to sayYou rogue when next you come our way.Defeated and filled with consternation the paladin returned to the king and told him about the wand and how badly he had been beaten. When the king heard that the fool possessed a wand that struck of itself he wanted it so much that for a time he forgot all about the tablecloth and sent some of his soldiers with orders to bring him back the wand.When they entered the cottage the fool as usual was lying on the stove.Deliver up the wand to us instantly said they the king is willing to pay any price you ask but if you refuse he will take it from you by force.Instead of replying the fool unwound the waistband saying to it as he did soO marvellous wonderful lakeforming BandFor my safety and not for my funBear me in a boat on thy waves far from landSo that I from my foes need not run.There was a shimmering in the air while at the same moment everything around them disappeared and a beautiful lake long wide and deep was seen surrounded by green fields. Fish with golden scales and eyes of pearls played in the clear water. In the centre in a small silver skiff rowed a man whom the soldiers recognised as the fool.They remained some time looking at this miracle and then ran off to tell the king. Now when the king heard thereof he was so anxious to possess the lake or rather the waistband that produced the lake that he sent a whole battalion of soldiers to take the fool prisoner.This time they managed to get hold of him while he was asleep but as they were about to tie his hands he turned his hat round and saidO Magic Helmet never thouDost want for powder nor shotAllay my fears and fire nowJust where I point. Fail not.Instantly a hundred bullets whistled through the air amid clouds of smoke and loud reports. Many of the soldiers fell dead others took refuge in the wood whence they returned to the king to give an account of what had taken place.Whereupon the king flew into a violent rage furious that he had as yet failed to take the fool. But his wish to possess the feastgiving tablecloth the magic wand the lakeforming sash and above all the helmet with twentyfour horns was stronger than ever.Having reflected for some days on the best ways and means to attain his object he resolved to try the effect of kindness and sent for the fools mother.Tell your son the fool said his majesty to the woman that my charming daughter and I send greeting and that we shall consider it an honour if he will come here and show us the marvellous things he possesses. Should he feel inclined to make me a present of them I will give him half my kingdom and will make him my heir. You may also say that the princess my daughter will choose him for her husband.The good woman hastened home to her son whom she advised to accept the kings invitation and show him his treasures. The fool wound the waistband round his loins put the helmet on his head hid the tablecloth in his breast took his magic wand in his hand and started off to go to the court.The king was not there on his arrival but he was received by the paladin who saluted him courteously. Music played and the troops did him military honoursin fact he was treated far better than he had expected. On being presented to the king he took off his helmet and bowing low said O king I am come to lay at the foot of your throne my tablecloth waistband wand and helmet. In return for these gifts I beg that your favour may be shown to the most humble of your subjects.Tell me then fool what price you want for these goodsNot money sire a fool of my sort cares very little about money. Has not the king promised my mother that he will give me in exchange the half of his kingdom and the hand of his daughter in marriage These are the gifts I claim.After these words the paladin was filled with envy at the good fortune of the fool and made a sign for the guards to enter. The soldiers seized the poor fellow dragged him out into the courtyard and they killed him treacherously to the sound of drums and trumpets after which they covered him over with earth.Now it happened that when the soldiers stabbed him his blood spurted out and some of the drops fell beneath the princesss window. The maiden wept bitterly at the sight watering the bloodstained ground with her tears. And lo marvellous to relate an appletree grew out of the bloodsprinkled earth. And it grew so rapidly that its branches soon touched the windows of her rooms by noon it was covered with blossom while at eventide ripe red apples hung thereon. As the princess was admiring them she noticed that one of the apples trembled and when she touched it it fell into the bosom of her dress. This took her fancy and she held it in her hand.Meanwhile the sun had set night had fallen and every one in the palace was asleep except the guard the paladin and the princess. The guard sword in hand patrolled up and down for it was his duty. The princess toyed with her pretty little apple and could not sleep. The paladin who had gone to bed was aroused by a sound that made his blood run cold for the avenging wand stood before him and began to beat him soundly. And although he rushed from the room trying to escape from it it followed him crying outFalse paladin you worthless manDo not so envious beWhy act unjustly when you canBoth just and honest beFor others goods why have you such a likingYou rogue you thief be sure Ill keep on striking.The unhappy man wept and cried for mercy but the wand still continued to strike.The princess was distressed on hearing these cries of distress and she watered her muchcherished apple with her tears. And strange to tell the apple grew and changed its shape. Thus continuing to change it suddenly turned into a handsome young man even the very same who had been killed that morning.Lovely princess I salute you said the fool. The cunning of the paladin caused my death but with your tears you have restored me to life. Your father promised to give you to me are you willingIf such be the kings wish I consent replied she as she gave him her hand with a tender look.As he spoke the door opened admitting the helmet which placed itself upon his head the sash which wound itself round his waist the tablecloth which hid itself in one of his pockets and the avenging wand which placed itself in his hand. Then came the king all out of breath and wondering what the noise was about. He was amazed to see the fool alive again and even more so that he should be with the princess.The young fellow fearing the kings wrath cried outO marvellous wonderful lakeforming BandFor my safety and not for my funBear us in a boat on thy waves far from landSo that we from our foes need not run.There was a shimmering in the air and then everything disappeared while on the lawn before the palace stretched a wide deep lake in the crystal water of which swam little fish with eyes of pearl and scales of gold. Far away rowed the princess and the fool in a silver skiff. The king stood on the shores of the lake and signed to them to return. When they had landed they knelt at his feet and avowed their mutual love. Upon which his majesty bestowed his blessing the lake disappeared and they again found themselves in the princesss apartments.The king called a special meeting of his council at which he explained how things had turned outthat he had made the fool his heir and betrothed him to his daughter and had put the paladin in prison.The fool gave the king his magic treasures and told him what words to say in each case.Next day all their wishes were fulfilled. The fool of the family was married to the princess and at the same time received half the kingdom with the promise of succession to the throne. And the wedding feast to which all the rich and noble of the land were invited exceeded in its magnificence and splendour any other festival ever seen or heard of.
In years long gone too many for the almanac to tell of or for clocks and watches to measure millions of good fairies came down from the sun and went into the earth. There they changed themselves into roots and leaves and became trees. There were many kinds of these as they covered the earth but the pine and birch ash and oak were the chief ones that made Holland. The fairies that lived in the trees bore the name of Moss Maidens or Tree Trintjes which is the Dutch pet name for Kate or Katharine.The oak was the favorite tree for people lived then on acorns which they ate roasted boiled or mashed or made into meal from which something like bread was kneaded and baked. With oak bark men tanned hides and made leather and from its timber boats and houses. Under its branches near the trunk people laid their sick hoping for help from the gods. Beneath the oak boughs also warriors took oaths to be faithful to their lords women made promises or wives joined hand in hand around its girth hoping to have beautiful children. Up among its leafy branches the new babies lay before they were found in the cradle by the other children. To make a young child grow up to be strong and healthy mothers drew them through a split sapling or young tree. Even more wonderful as medicine for the country itself the oak had power to heal. The new land sometimes suffered from disease called the val or fall. When sick with the val the ground sunk. Then people houses churches barns and cattle all went down out of sight and were lost forever in a flood of water.But the oak with its mighty roots held the soil firm. Stories of dead cities that had tumbled beneath the waves and of the famous Forest of Reeds covering a hundred villages which disappeared in one night were known only too well.Under the birch tree lovers met to plight their vows and on its smooth bark was often cut the figure of two hearts joined in one. In summer the forest furnished shade and in winter warmth from the fire. In the spring time the new leaves were a wonder and in autumn the pigs grew fat on the mast or the acorns that had dropped on the ground.So for thousands of years when men made their home in the forest and wanted nothing else the trees were sacred.But by and by when cows came into the land and sheep and horses multiplied more open ground was needed for pasture grain fields and meadows. Fruit trees bearing apples and pears peaches and cherries were planted and grass wheat rye and barley were grown. Then instead of the dark woods men liked to have their gardens and orchards open to the sunlight. Still the people were very rude and all they had on their bare feet were rough bits of hard leather tied on through their toes though most of them went barefooted.The forests had to be cut down. Men were so busy with the axe that in a few years the Wood Land was gone. Then the new Holland with its people and red roofed houses with its chimneys and windmills and dykes and storks took the place of the old Holt Land of many trees.Now there was a good man a carpenter and very skilful with his tools who so loved the oak that he gave himself and his children after him the name of Eyck which is pronounced Ike and is Dutch for oak. When before his neighbors and friends according to the beautiful Dutch custom he called his youngest born child to lay the cornerstone of his new house he bestowed upon her before them all the name of Neeltje or Nellie Van Eyck.The carpenter daddy continued to mourn over the loss of the forests. He even shed tears fearing lest by and by there should not one oak tree be left in the country. Moreover he was frightened at the thought that the new land made by pushing back the ocean and building dykes might sink down again and go back to the fishes. In such a case all the people the babies and their mothers men women horses and cattle would be drowned. The Dutch folks were a little too fast he thought in winning their acres from the sea.One day while sitting on his doorstep brooding sorrowfully a Moss Maiden and a Tree Elf appeared skipping along hand in hand. They came up to him and told him that his ancestral oak had a message for him. Then they laughed and ran away. Van Eyck which was now the mans full family name went into the forest and stood under the grand old oak tree which his fathers loved and which he would allow none to cut down.Looking up the leaves of the tree rustled and one big branch seemed to sweep near him. Then it whispered in his earDo not mourn for your descendants even many generations hence shall see greater things than you have witnessed. I and my fellow oak trees shall pass away but the sunshine shall be spread over the land and make it dry. Then instead of its falling down like acorns from the trees more and better food shall come up from out of the earth. Where green fields now spread and the cities grow where forests were we shall come to life again but in another form. When most needed we shall furnish you and your children and childrens children with warmth comfort fire light and wealth. Nor need you fear for the land that it will fall for even while living we and all the oak trees that are left and all the birch beech and pine trees shall stand on our heads for you. We shall hold up your houses lest they fall into the ooze and you shall walk and run over our heads. As truly as when rooted in the soil will we do this. Believe what we tell you and be happy. We shall turn ourselves upside down for you.I cannot see how all these things can be said Van Eyck.Fear not my promise will endure.The leaves of the branch rustled for another moment. Then all was still until the Moss Maiden and Trintje the Tree Elf again hand in hand as they tripped along merrily appeared to him.We shall help you and get our friends the elves to do the same. Now do you take some oak wood and saw off two pieces each a foot long. See that they are well dried. Then set them on the kitchen table tonight when you go to bed. After saying this and looking at each other and laughing just as girls do they disappeared.Pondering on what all this might mean Van Eyck went to his woodshed and sawed off the oak timber. At night after his wife had cleared off the supper table he laid the footlong pieces in their place.When Van Eyck woke up in the morning he recalled his dream and before he was dressed hurried to the kitchen. There on the table lay a pair of neatly made wooden shoes. Not a sign of tools or shavings could be seen but the clean wood and pleasant odor made him glad. When he glanced again at the wooden shoes he found them perfectly smooth both inside and out. They had heels at the bottom and were nicely pointed at the toes and altogether were very inviting to the foot. He tried them on and found that they fitted him exactly. He tried to walk on the kitchen floor which his wife kept scrubbed and polished and then sprinkled with clean white sand with broomstick ripples scored in the layers but for Van Eyck it was like walking on ice. After slipping and balancing himself as if on a tight rope and nearly breaking his nose against the wall he took off the wooden shoes and kept them off while inside the house. However when he went outdoors he found his new shoes very light pleasant to the feet and easy to walk in. It was not so much like trying to skate as it had been in the kitchen.At night in his dreams he saw two elves come through the window into the kitchen. One a kabouter dark and ugly had a box of tools. The other a lightfaced elf seemed to be the guide. The kabouter at once got out his saw hatchet auger long chisellike knife and smoothing plane. At first the two elves seemed to be quarrelling as to who should be boss. Then they settled down quietly to work. The kabouter took the wood and shaped it on the outside. Then he hollowed out from inside of it a pair of shoes which the elf smoothed and polished. Then one elf put his little feet in them and tried to dance but he only slipped on the smooth floor and flattened his nose but the other fellow pulled the nose straight again so it was all right. They waltzed together upon the wooden shoes then took them off jumped out the window and ran away.When Van Eyck put the wooden shoes on he found that out in the fields in the mud and on the soft soil and in sloppy places this sort of foot gear was just the thing. They did not sink in the mud and the mans feet were comfortable even after hours of labor. They did not draw his feet and they kept out the water far better than leather possibly could.When the Van Eyck vrouw and the children saw how happy Daddy was they each one wanted a pair. Then they asked him what he called them.Klompen said he in good Dutch and klompen or klomps they are to this day.Ill make a fortune out of this said Van Eyck. Ill set up a klompwinkel shop for wooden shoes at once.So going out to the blacksmiths shop in the village he had the man who pounded iron fashion for him on his anvil a set of tools exactly like those used by the kabouter and the elf which he had seen in his dream. Then he hung out a sign marked Wooden blocks for shoes. He made klomps for the little folks just out of the nursery for boys and girls for grown men and women and for all who walked outofdoors in the street or on the fields.Soon klomps came to be the fashion in all the country places. It was good manners when you went into a house to take off your wooden shoes and leave them at the door. Even in the towns and cities ladies wore wooden slippers especially when walking or working in the garden.Klomps also set the fashion for soft warm socks and stockings made from sheeps wool. Soon a thousand needles were clicking to put a soft cushion between ones soles and toes and the wood. Women knitted even while they walked to market or gossiped on the streets. The klompwinkels or shops of the shoe carpenters were seen in every village.When rich beyond his daydreams Van Eyck had another joyful night vision. The next day he wore a smiling countenance. Everybody who met him on the street saluted him and asked in a neighborly wayGoodmorning Mynheer Blymoedig Mr. Cheerful. How do you sail todayThats the way the Dutch talknot how do you do but in their watery country it is this How do you sail or else Hoe gat het u al How goes it with you alreadyThen Van Eyck told his dream. It was this The Moss Maiden and Trintje the wood elf came to him again at night and danced. They were lively and happy.What now asked the dreamer smilingly of his two visitors.He had hardly got the question out of his mouth when in walked a kabouter all smutty with blacksmith work. In one hand he grasped his tool box. In the other he held a curious looking machine. It was a big lump of iron set in a frame with ropes to pull it up and let it fall down with a thump.What is it asked Van Eyck.Its a Hey a pile driver said the kabouter showing him how to use it. When men say to you on the street tomorrow How do you sail laugh at them said the Moss Maiden herself laughing.Yes and now you can tell the people how to build cities with mighty churches with lofty towers and with high houses like those in other lands. Take the trees trim the branches off sharpen the tops turn them upside down and pound them deep in the ground. Did not the ancient oak promise that the trees would be turned upside down for you Did they not say you could walk on top of themBy this time Van Eyck had asked so many questions and kept the elves so long that the Moss Maiden peeped anxiously through the window. Seeing the day breaking she and Trintje and the kabouter flew away so as not to be petrified by the sunrise.Ill make another fortune out of this also said the happy man who next morning was saluted as Mynheer Blydschap Mr. Joyful.At once Van Eyck set up a factory for making pile drivers. Sending men into the woods who chose the tall straight trees he had their branches cut off. Then he sharpened the trunks at one end and these were driven by the pile driver down far and deep into the ground. So a foundation as good as stone was made in the soft and spongy soil and well built houses uprose by the thousands. Even the lofty walls of churches stood firm. The spires were unshaken in the storm.Old Holland had not fertile soil like France or vast flocks of sheep producing wool like England or armies of weavers as in the Belgic lands. Yet soon there rose large cities with splendid mansions and town halls. As high towards heaven as the cathedrals and towers in other lands which had rock for foundation her brick churches rose in the air. On top of the forest trees driven deep into the sand and clay dams and dykes were built that kept out the ocean. So instead of the old two thousand square miles there were in the realm in the course of years twelve thousand rich in green fields and cattle. Then for all the boys and girls that travel in this land of quaint customs Holland was a delight.
An old woman found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose and drawing it backwards and forwards said O most delicious How nice must the Wine itself have been when it leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfumeThe memory of a good deed lives.
Itajung one of the Inuit tribe was vexed because a young woman would not marry him so he left his home and traveled far away into the land of the birds. He came to a small lake in which many geese were swimming. On the shore he saw a great many boots. He cautiously crept near and stole a pair and hid them.Presently the birds came out of the water and finding a pair of boots gone they were alarmed and quickly forming into two long lines with their leader at the point where the lines met they flew away crying Honk Honk HonkBut one of the flock remained behind crying I want my boots I want my bootsItajung came forth from his hidingplace and said I will give you your boots if you will become my wife.That I will not do she replied.Very well he said and turned around to go away.I dont want to but I will be your wife if you will bring back my boots she called.He came back and gave her the boots and when she put them on she was changed into a woman.They walked away together and wandered down to the seaside and as she liked to live near the water they settled in a large village by the sea. Here they lived for several years and had a son. Itajung became a highly respected man for he was by far the best whaler in all the Inuit tribe.One day they killed a whale and were busy cutting it up and carrying the meat and blubber to their homes. Many of the women were helping but though Itajung was working very hard his wife stood lazily looking on.Come and help us he called to her.My food is not from the sea she replied. My food is from the land. I will not eat the meat of a whale neither will I help.You must eat it it will fill your stomach said he.She began to cry and said I will not eat it. I will not soil my nice white clothing.She went to the beach and searched for feathers. When she found some she put them between her fingers and the fingers of her child. They were both turned into geese and flew away. When the Inuit saw this they cried Itajung your wife is flying away.Itajung became very sad. He no longer cared for the meat and blubber nor for the whales spouting near the shore. He followed in the direction his wife had taken and went over all the land in search of her.After traveling for many weary months he came to a river where a man with a large axe was chopping chips from a piece of wood and as fast as he chopped them they were turned into salmon and slipped out of the mans hands into the river and swam down to a large lake near by. The name of the man was Small Salmon.As Itajung looked at the man he was frightened almost to death for the back of the man was entirely hollow and Itajung could see right through him and out at the other side. He was so scared that he kept very still and crept back and away out around him. He wanted to ask if the man had seen his wife for that was what he asked everyone he came to. So he went around and came from the opposite direction facing the man.When Small Salmon saw him approaching he stopped chopping and asked Which way did you approach meI came from that direction said Itajung pointing in the way he had last approached.That is lucky for you for if you had come the other way and had seen my back I should have killed you at once with my hatchet.I am glad I dont have to die said Itajung. But havent you seen my wife She left me and came this way.Yes I saw her. Do you see that little island in the large lake That is where she lives now and she has taken another husband.Oh I can never reach her said Itajung in despair. I have no boat and do not know how to reach the island.I will help you said Small Salmon kindly. Come down to the beach with me. Here is the backbone of a salmon. Now shut your eyes. The backbone will turn into a kayak and carry you safely to the island. But mind you keep your eyes shut. If you open them the kayak will upset.I will obey said Itajung.He closed his eyes the backbone became a kayak and away he sped over the water. He heard no splashing and was anxious to know if he really was moving so he peeped open his eyes a trifle.At once the boat began to swing violently but he quickly shut his eyes and it went on steadily and he soon landed on the island.There he saw a hut and his son playing on the beach near it. The boy on looking up saw and recognized him and ran to his mother cryingMother Father is here and is coming to our hut.Go back to your play she said your father is far away and cannot find us.The lad went back but again he ran in sayingMother Father is here and is coming to our hut.Again she sent him away but he soon returned saying Father is right here.He had scarcely said it when Itajung opened the door. When the new husband saw him he said to his wife Open that box in the corner of the hut.She did so and a great quantity of feathers flew out and stuck fast to them. The hut disappeared. The woman her new husband and the child were transformed into geese and flew away leaving Itajung standing alone.
A weary woman was Hina and as the years grew on her she grew more and more weary. All day she sat outside her house beating out tapas for clothes for her family making cloths out of the bark of a tree by beating it on a board with a mallet. Weary indeed was Hina with making tapas all the day outside her house. And when she might see no more to beat out the tapas  she would have to get her calabash and bring water to the house. Often she would stumble in the dark coming back with her calabash of water. There was no one in her house to help her. Her son went sailing from island to island robbing people and her daughter went to live with the wild people in the forest. Her husband had become bad tempered and he was always striving to make her do more and more work.As Hina grew old she longed more and more to go to a place where she might sit and rest herself. And one day when she was given a new task and was sent to fish up shrimps amongst the rocks with a net she cried out Oh that I might go away from this place and to a place where I might stay and rest myself.It made an arching path for her from the rocks up to the heavens. With the net in her hands she went along that path. Illustration by Juliette May Fraser published in At the Gateways of the Day by Padraic Colum 1924 Oxford University Press.The Rainbow heard Hina and had pity on her. It made an arching path for her from the rocks up to the heavens. With the net in her hands she went along that path. She thought she would go up to the heavens and then over to the Sun and that she would go into the Sun and rest herself there.She went higher and higher along the arch of the Rainbow. But as she went on the rays of the Sun beat on her more and more strongly. She held the net over her head and went on and on. But when she went beyond the clouds and there was nothing to shelter her the rays of the Sun burnt her terribly. On and on she went but as she went higher she could only crawl along the path. Then the fire of the Suns rays began to torture her and shrivel her. She could go no farther and slipping back along the Rainbow arch she came to earth again.It was dark now. She stood outside her house and saw her husband coming back from the pool with a calabash of water stumbling and saying illtempered words about her. And when she showed herself to him he scolded because she had not been there to bring the calabash of water to the house.Now that the Sun was gone down and his rays were no longer upon her  her strength came back to Hina. She looked up into the sky  and she saw the full Moon there and she said To the Moon I will go. It is very quiet and there I can sit for a long long time and rest myself. But first she went into the house for the calabash that held all the things that on earth were precious to her. She came out of her house carrying the calabash and there before her door was a moonrainbow.Her husband came and asked her where she was going because she carried her calabash he knew she was going far. I am going to the Moon to a place where I can rest myself  she said. She began to climb along the arch of the Rainbow. And now she was almost out of her husband s reach. But he sprang up and caught her foot in his hand. He fell back twisting and breaking her foot as he fell.But Hina went on. She was lamed and she was filled with pain and yet she rejoiced as she went along through the quiet night. On and on she went. She came to where the Stars were and she said incantations to them that they might show her how to come to the Moon. And the Stars showed her the way and she came at last to the Moon.She came to the Moon with the calabash that had her precious possessions and the Moon gave her a place where she might rest. There Hina stayed  And the people of Hawaii can look up to the bright Moon and see her there. She sits her foot lamed and with her calabash by her side. Seeing her there the people call her not  Hina  any more but Lono Moku  that is Lame Lono.And standing outside the door you can see her now  Hina the Woman in the Moon. But some say that  instead of the calabash  she took with her her tapaboard and mallet and they say that the fine fleecy clouds that you see around the Moon are really the fine tapacloths that Hina beats out.
Once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and many children. Now it happened that the fisherman did not catch any fish for a time and did not know how to support his family. One day he cast his net and drew out a large fish which began to talk Let me go and cast in your net again and you will catch as many fish as you wish. The fisherman did so and caught more fish than he remembered to have taken before. But in a few days the fish were gone and the fisherman cast his net again and again caught the big fish which said I see clearly that I must die so kill me now and cut me into pieces. Give half to the king a piece to your wife one to your dog and one to your horse the bones you will tie to the kitchen rafters your wife will bear sons and when anything happens to one of them the fishbone will sweat drops of blood. The fisherman did as he was told and in due time his wife gave birth to three sons the dog to three puppies and the horse to three colts. The boys grew up and went to school and learned much and prospered. One day the oldest said I want to go and see a little of the world and took one of the dogs one of the horses and some money and set out after receiving his fathers and mothers blessing. He arrived at a forest and there saw a lion an eagle and an ant which had found a dead ass that they wanted to divide among themselves but could not agree and so were quarrelling. They saw the youth and called on him to make the division. He was afraid at first but took heart and gave the lean meat to the eagle the brains to the ant and the rest to the lion. They were all satisfied and the youth continued his way. After he had gone a few steps the animals called him back and the lion said You have settled our dispute and we wish to reward you when you wish to become a lion you have only to say No more a man a lion with the strength of a hundred lions The eagle said When you wish to become an eagle say No more a man an eagle with the strength of a hundred eagles The ant also gave him power to transform himself into an ant in the same way. The youth thanked them and departed. As he was passing along the shore of the sea he saw a dogfish that was out of the water he put it back into the sea. The fish said When you need me come to the sea and cry Dogfish help meThe youth continued his way and arrived at a city all hung with mourning. What is the matter the young man asked. There is here they told him a big cloud it was a fairy that every year must have a young girl. This year the lot has fallen on the kings daughter. If they do not give her up the cloud will throw so many things into the city that we shall all be killed. The youth asked if he could see how the thing went and they told him he could. The ceremony began with muffled drums and an escort of soldiers the king and queen in tears accompanied their daughter who was taken to the top of a mountain placed in a chair and left alone. The youth who had followed them hid himself behind a bush. Then the cloud came took the young girl in her lap took her finger in her mouth and began to suck her blood. This was what the cloud lived on.The princess remained half dead like a log and then the cloud carried her away. The youth who had seen all this cried No more a man an eagle with the strength of a hundred eagles Then he became an eagle and flew after the cloud. They arrived at a palace the doors flew open and the cloud entered and carried the princess upstairs. The eagle alighted on a tree opposite and saw a large room all full of young girls in bed. When the cloud entered they exclaimed Mamma here is our mammaThe poor girls were always in bed because the fairy half killed them. She put the princess in a bed and said to the girls I am going to leave you for a few days. She went away and left the girls. The youth was near and heard everything he said No more an eagle an ant with the force of a hundred ants He became an ant entered the palace unseen and went to the room where the young girls were. There he resumed his shape and the girls were astonished at seeing a man appear so suddenly and one of them said to him Take care there is a fairy here if she finds you on her return she will kill you. Do not be troubled he answered for I wish to see about setting you all free.Then he went to the bed of the kings daughter and asked her if she had some token to send her mother. She gave him a ring and the youth took it and went to the queen told her where her daughter was and asked her to send some food to the poor girl. She did so and the youth retraced his steps reached the palace informed the girls and drew up the food with ropes. He then said to the girls When the fairy returns ask her what you shall do when she dies thus you will find out how to kill her.Then he hid himself and when the fairy returned the girls asked her the question but she answered I shall never die. They urged her to tell them and the next day she took them out on a terrace and said Do you see that mountain far off there On that mountain is a tigress with seven heads. If you wish me to die a lion must fight that tigress and tear off all seven of her heads. In her body is an egg and if any one hits me with it in the middle of my forehead I shall die but if that egg falls into my hands the tigress will come to life again resume her seven heads and I shall live. Good said the young girls certainly our mamma can never die. But in their hearts they were discouraged. When the fairy had departed the youth came forth and they told him all. Do not be disheartened he said and straightway went to the princess father asked him for a room a pan of bread a barrel of good wine and a child seven years old. He took all these things and shut himself up in the room and said to the child Do you want to see something my child I am going to turn into a lion.Then he turned into a lion and the child was afraid but the youth persuaded him that it was only himself after all and the child fed him and was no longer frightened. As soon as he had instructed the child he took all the things and went to the mountain where the tigress was. Then he filled the pan with bread and wine and said to the child I am going to become a lion when I return give me something to eat.Then he became a lion and went to fight the tigress. Meanwhile the fairy returned home saying Alas I feel ill The young girls said to themselves in delight Good The youth fought until night and tore off one of the tigress heads the second day another and so on until six heads were gone. The fairy kept losing her strength all the time. The youth rested two days before tearing off the last head and then resumed the fight. At evening the last head was torn off and the dead tigress disappeared but the youth was not quick enough to catch the egg which rolled from her body into the sea and was swallowed by the dogfish.Then the youth went to the sea Dogfish help me The fish appeared What do you want Have you found an egg Yes. Give it to me and the fish gave him the egg. He took it and went in search of the fairy and suddenly appeared before her with the egg in his hand. The fairy wanted him to give her the egg but he made her first restore all the young girls to health and send them home in handsome carriages. Then the youth took the egg struck it on the fairys forehead and she fell down dead. When the youth saw that she was really dead he entered a carriage with the kings daughter and drove to the palace. When the king and queen saw their daughter again they wept for joy and married her to her deliverer. The wedding took place with great magnificence and there were great festivities and rejoicings in the city.A few days after the husband looked out of the window and saw at the end of the street a dense fog he said to his wife I will go and see what that fog is. So he dressed for the chase and went away with his dog and horse. After he had passed through the mist he saw a mountain on which were two beautiful ladies. They came to meet him and invited him to their palace. He accepted and they showed him into a room and one of the ladies asked Would you like to play a game of chess Very well he answered and began to play and lost. Then they took him into a garden where there were many marble statues and turned him into one together with his dog and horse. These ladies were sisters of the fairy and this was the way they avenged her death.Meanwhile the princess waited and her husband did not return. One morning the father and brothers of the youth found the kitchen full of blood which dropped from the fishbone. Something has happened to him they said and the second brother started in search of him with another one of the dogs and horses. He passed by the palace of the princess who was at the window and those brothers looked so much alike that when she saw him she thought it was her husband and called him. He entered and she spoke to him of the fog but he did not understand her he let her talk on however imagining that his brother was mixed up in that affair. The next morning he arose and went to see the fog with his dog and horse. He passed through the fog found the mountain and the two ladies and to make the story short the same thing happened to him that happened to his brother and he became stone. And the queen waited and in the fathers kitchen the bone dropped blood faster than ever.The third brother too set out with his dog and horse. When he came to the palace the princess saw him from the window took him for her husband and called him in. He entered and she reproved him for having made her wait so long and spoke of the mist but he did not understand her and said I did not see very clearly what was in the mist and I wish to go there again. He departed and when he had passed through the mist he met an old man who said to him Where are you going Take care your brothers have been turned into statues. You will meet two ladies if they ask you to play chess with them here are two pawns say that you cannot play except with your own pawns. Then make an agreement with them that if you win you can do with them what you please if they win they can do what they please with you. If you win and they beg for mercy command them to restore to life all the stone statues with which the palace is filled and when they have done so you can do what you will with these ladies.The youth thanked the old man departed followed his directions and won. The two ladies begged for their lives and he granted their prayer on condition of restoring to life all those stone statues. They took a wand touched the statues and they became animated but no sooner were they all restored to life than they fell on the two ladies and cut them into bits no larger than their ears.Thus the three brothers were reunited. They related their adventures and returned to the palace. The princess was astonished when she saw them and did not know which was her husband. But he made himself known told her that these were his brothers and they had their parents come there and they all lived happily together and thus the story is ended.
Once upon a time there lived a man named Yang Tsu. He was a street peddler and for that reason he wandered up and down the streets all day long with the tray which contained his wares hanging from his neck in front of him. As he cried his wares his eyes took in all the wonders of the rich and splendid city. He saw the silkrobed mandarins with their great escorts. He saw the mighty warriors with the shadows of distant adventures darkening their features. And from goldembroidered curtained litters the almond fragrance of invisible beauties was wafted to his perspiring face.All this filled his soul with discontent and envy and longing and when he came home in the evening healways would quarrel with YuNu his wife for he was restless and excited. And then there would be weeping and wailing half the night long.One morning when YuNu had again awakened and looking in her mirror had seen the little red veins in her eyes she said to YangTsuGo and buy a parasolWhy should I buy a parasol asked her husband. Because it is all due to the heat of the sun. Thepowerful sunrays excite you so that you cannot help  quarreling. Therefore we live unhappily and there are red veins in my eyes.YangTsu went about his daily work without making a reply for he was not a bad man and he thoughtover what his wife had said. He noticed as he went along the street that the sun shone with such powerthat the sunrays rose straight up from the pavement like a glowing golden trellis. Perhaps she is rightthought YangTsu and he turned his steps toward the artisans quarter.In this quarter there was much noise and shouting for each merchant sat in front of his shop on a mat and praised the goods he offered for sale. Suddenly YangTsu heard a shrill voice rise above the otherswhich cried Buy parasols An infinite choice Every one can spread the sky he loves best above his headYangTsu was much surprised to hear these strange words and went over to the parasolmaker. The latter was a large serious man. He sat on the cobblestones and round about him lay his parasols. What is it you keep calling out most respected maker of parasols YangTsu asked him. Did you say these parasols could spread a heaven above my head I admit that they are handsome yet I cannot notice that they are different from any others I have seen.The parasolmaker replied with a serious smile These parasols only look alike from the outside mostrespected questioner please deign to open one of them.YangTsu raised a parasol from the ground and opened it and was greatly surprised. For the inner side of the parasol had been painted in such wise that it pictured a summer sky filled with the most tendercurly little white clouds and the painting had been so artfully done that it seemed as though one were walking beneath them.You see most respected questioner said the parasolmaker as long as you carry this parasol theradiant summer skies above your head will neverdarken and beneath their influence your soul alwayswill be cheerful.YangTsu was overjoyed to hear this yet he cautiously said It is true that I need to buy a parasol for I quarrel every night with my wife YuNu. But that is due to the heat of the sun. Therefore I do not think that a warm summer sky above my head will tend to quiet me.Then choose some other sky answered the parasolmaker. I have the largest selection of skies in thecity. He opened a second parasol. It showed a dull misty winter sky like shimmering gray silk. Thesmoke of distant villages rose on the horizon. That is the sky of tender melancholy said the parasolmaker. In this melancholy you can live your life long as peacefully as though you were wrapped in the softest wool.But YangTsu thought this sky too mournful and opened a third and then a fourth parasol and othersbeside. There was a morning sky before sunrise in which all the days happenings still glowed in purity before sinking down to the dusty earth. There was one which showed the blue through a wilderness of upright grasses as though one were lying on ones back in a meadow looking dreamily up toward the heavens. Under this parasol it was possible to carry along with one the deep peace of solitude through the noisiest streets. There was another parasol with a nocturnal sky lighted by a full moon and from that sky all the songs of lovers hung like clusters of grapes. There also was a parasol with a glassy sky above snowcovered mountain peaks where no sign of life disturbed the repose of the soul.YangTsu chose the nocturnal sky with the full moon and went his way. But the parasol did not bring peaceto his home. The songs of the lovers dripped down from the moon into his soul and their passion kept him as restless as before. On the third day YangTsu brought back the parasol with the nocturnal sky and exchanged it for one of quiet meadow solitude. Yet neither did this one help him. Too often he forgot to attend to his work and when his wife spoke to him he merely started up as though from a dream sorrowfully. This parasol YangTsu also brought back on the third day. So he kept on exchanging one parasol for another until in the end he had tried them all.Then the parasolmaker said to YangTsu Now that you have tried each and every sky and none has brought rest to your soul so that you can live at peace with your wife I have a single parasol left. Perhaps fate wills that it be of use to youAcross it wild geese flew in the shape of a long wedge. Illustration by Da Loria Norman published in Wonder Tales from Far Away by Frederick H. Martens 1924 Robert M. McBride and Company.The parasolmaker pressed his hands against his knees and rose panting for he was a very fat man. Hewent into his workroom and came back with a parasol which seemed far less handsome than the others. YangTsu opened it and saw a lovely gray autumn evening sky with a rosy horizon. Across it wild geese flew in the shape of a long wedge. A painful longing took possession of the heart when the eye followed the flight of these wild geese. It was a longing for unknown unattainable distances. And YangTsu took the parasol along because he no longer had a choice.With the autumnal evening sky above his head and the vague and distant uncertain longing in his hearthe then wandered through the streets of the city and saw the splendor of the wealthy the glittering mandarins the mighty warriors and the goldembroidered litters. But none of these things now had power to excite his soul for his glance followed the flying geese into unknown distances. And when he returned home in the evening to his wife though his mood was slightly melancholy yet he spoke to her in a quiet and friendly manner.From that day on YangTsu lived in peace and contentment with his wife YuNu. It is true that likeevery other human being her heart was also at timesfilled with a painful restlessness which seemed toogreat for her little home to contain. Then she wouldopen the parasol and her eyes would follow the wandering wild geese in their flight. And her restlessness would fly far away with them in longing as the smoke flies out of the chimney and no longer poisons the air of the room. Soon YuNu found no red veins in her eyes for like her husband she had found in the parasolmakers last parasol a sky which brought peace and contentment.
Once upon a time there was a king who went forth into the world and fetched back a beautiful queen. And after they had been married a while God gave them a little daughter. Then there was great rejoicing in the city and throughout the country for the people wished their king all that was good since he was kind and just. While the child lay in its cradle a strangelooking old woman entered the room and no one knew who she was nor whence she came. The old woman spoke a verse over the child and said that she must not be allowed out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age since otherwise the mountain troll would fetch her. When the king heard this he took her words to heart and posted guards to watch over the little princess so that she would not get out under the open sky.Some time afterward God gave the royal pair another little daughter and again the whole kingdom rejoiced. But the wise old woman once more put in an appearance and warned the king not to let the princess out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age. And then after a time God gave the royal pair a third daughter. This time too the old woman appeared and repeated what she had already twice said. Then the king was much grieved for he loved his children above everything in the world. Therefore he gave strict orders that the three princesses were always to be kept beneath the roof of the castle and that none were to dare transgress against this command.Now a long time passed and the kings daughters grew up and became the most beautiful maidens of whom one has ever heard tell. Then war broke out and the king their father had to leave them. One day while he was away at war the three princesses were sitting in the window and looking out watching the sun shine on the little flowers in the garden. And they felt a great desire to play with the lovely flowers and begged their guards to let them go into the garden for a little while. But this their guards would not allow for they feared the kings anger. Yet the kings daughters pleaded so very sweetly that they could not deny their pleas and they let them have their way. But the princesses did not have long to walk about for no sooner were they beneath the open sky than a cloud came suddenly down and bore them off and all attempts to regain possession of them were fruitless though search was made in every direction.Then the whole kingdom mourned and grieved and one may imagine that the king was anything but happy when he returned home and learned all that had happened. Yet what is done cannot be undone and in the end they had to resign themselves to it. And since the king knew of no other way to help himself he had proclaimed throughout the kingdom that whoever would deliver his three daughters out of the power of the mountain troll should have one of them for his bride and with her half of the kingdom. When this became known in foreign lands many youths set forth with horses and followers to seek the princesses. At the kings court were two princes who also went forth to see whether fortune would be kind to them. They armed themselves in the best possible way with coats of mail and costly weapons and bragged and boasted that they would not return without having done what they set out to do.And now we will let the kings sons ride out over the world on their quest while we turn to other people. Far far out in the wild wood there lived a poor widow who had an only son who drove his mothers pigs to pasture every day. And as he crossed the fields he whittled himself a flute and amused himself playing it. And he played so sweetly that he warmed the cockles of the hearts of all those who heard him.The old man had a large powerful dog with him. Illustration by unknown illustrator used under Creative Commons.Now it chanced that the young swineherd once sat in the wood blowing his flute while his three pigs were digging under the pineroots. And an old old man came along with a beard so long and so broad that it hung far below his girdle. The old man had a large powerful dog with him. When the youth saw the great dog he thought to himself If a fellow had a dog like that to keep him company here in the wilderness he might consider himself lucky. And when the old man noticed this he began That is why I have come for I want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs. The youth was at once willing and closed the bargain. He received the great dog and gave up the gray pig in place of it. Then the old man went his way. But as he left he said You have reason to be satisfied with our exchange for that dog is not like other dogs. His name is Take Hold and whatever you tell him to take hold of he will seize even though it were the grimmest of trolls. Thereupon they parted and the youth thought that fortune had indeed favored him.In the evening he called his dog and drove his pigs home. But when his old mother heard that he had given away the gray pig for a dog she was angry beyond measure and gave her son a good drubbing. The youth told her to calm herself but all in vain the longer it lasted the more furious she became. Then since he did not know what else to do he called out to his dog Take hold At once the dog ran up seized the old mother and held her so tightly that she could not move. But otherwise he did her no harm. And now she had to promise her son to make the best of the matter and then they were friends once more.The following day the youth went to the wood again with his dog and the two pigs. After a time he sat down and played his flute as usual and the dog danced to his playing with such skill that it was nothing short of a miracle. And as he was sitting there the old man with the gray beard came out of the wood again and with him another dog no smaller than the first. When the youth saw the handsome beast he thought to himself If a fellow had that dog to keep him company here where it is so lonely he need have no fear. When the old man noticed this he began That is why I have come for I want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs. The youth did not lose any time but agreed to close the bargain. He received the great dog and gave up one of his pigs in place of it. Then the old man went his way. Yet before he left he added You have reason to be well satisfied with your purchase for this dog is not like the other dogs. His name is Tear and if you give him something to tear he will tear it to pieces even though it were the grimmest of trolls. Then they parted. But the youth was happy in the idea that he had made a capital exchange although he knew that his old mother would not be content with it. And when evening came and the youth went home his old mother was no less angry than she had been before. But this time she did not venture to beat her son because she was afraid of the great dogs. Yet as is usual when women have scolded long enough they stop of their own accordand that is what happened in this case. The youth and his mother made peace with each other though the mother thought to herself that the damage done could not well be repaired.On the third day the youth went into the wood again with his pig and two dogs. He felt very happy seated himself on a treestump and played his flute as usual. And the dogs danced to his playing with such skill that it was a pleasure to watch them. As the youth was sitting there in peace and quiet the old graybeard once more came out of the wood. This time he had a third dog with him who was as large as both the others together. When the youth saw the handsome animal he could not help but think If a fellow had this dog to keep him company in the wilderness he would have no cause for complaint. The old man at once began That is why I have come in order to sell my dog for I can see you would like to have him. The youth was at once willing and agreed to close the bargain. So he received the great dog and gave up his last pig in place of it. Then the old man went his way. Yet before he went he said You will be satisfied with your exchange for this dog is not like other dogs. His name is Hark and his hearing is so keen that he hears everything that happens though it be happening many miles away. He even hears the grass and the trees grow. Then they parted in the friendliest spirit. But the youth was happy in the thought that now he need fear nothing in the world. And then when evening came on and the swineherd went home his mother was very sad to think that her son had sold all they possessed. But the youth told her to be of good courage since he would see to it that they did not suffer want. And when he spoke to her in such a cheerful manner she grew content again and decided that he had spoken in wise and manly fashion. Then when day dawned the youth went hunting with his dogs and came back at evening with as much game as he could possibly carry. And he continued to go hunting in this way for a time until his old mothers storeroom was well provided with meat and all sorts of good things. Then he bade his mother a fond farewell called his dogs and said he was going to wander out into the world and try his fortune.And he fared forth over mountains and tangled ways and came into the heart of a sombre forest. There he met the graybeard of whom I have already told you. And when he met him the youth was much pleased and said Goodday grandfather and thanks for the last time And the old man replied Goodday to you and whither away The youth answered I am wandering out into the world to see what fortune has in store for me. Then the old man said Keep right on going till you come to the royal castle and there your fortune will take a turn. And with that they parted. The youth followed the old mans advice and for a time wandered on straight ahead. When he came to a tavern he played his flute and let his dogs dance and was never at a lack for bed and board and whatever else he might want.After he had wandered long and far he at length came to a great city whose streets were filled with people. The youth wondered what it all meant and at last reached the spot where to the sound of bell the kings proclamation was being criedthat whoever should deliver the three princesses out of the power of the troll would receive one of them and half the kingdom as well. Now he understood what the old man had meant. He called his dogs and went to the kings castle. But there all had been grief and mourning since the day the kings daughters had disappeared. And of them all the king and queen were the most sorrowful. Then the youth went to the keeper of the door and asked him whether he might play and show his dogs before the king. The courtiers were willing for they hoped it might make him feel more cheerful. So he was admitted and allowed to show his tricks. And when the king had heard him play and had seen the skillful dancing of his dogs he grew quite merry and none had seen him as happy during all the seven long years that had passed since he had lost his daughters.When the dance was over the king asked the youth what he asked as a reward for having given him such a pleasure. The youth answered My lord king I did not come to you to win gold and gear. But I have another request to make that you allow me to set out and search for your three daughters carried away by a mountain troll. When the king heard this his thoughts once more grew gloomy and he replied You need not even think of delivering my daughters. It is no childs play and your betters have already attempted it in vain. Yet should it really come to pass that you deliver one of the princesses you may be sure that I will not break my word. So he took leave of the king and set forth. And he decided to take no rest until he had found what he sought.Now he passed through many broad kingdoms without meeting with any special adventures. And wherever he went his dogs followed him. Hark ran along and listened for anything worth hearing to be heard around them Take Hold carried his masters knapsack and Tear who was the strongest carried his master when the latter was weary. One day Hark came running up hastily and told his master that he had gone to a high mountain and had heard the kings daughter who sat within it and span and that the troll was not at home. This greatly pleased the youth and he hurried toward the mountain together with his three dogs. When they got there Hark said There is no time to lose. The troll is only ten miles away and I can already hear the golden horseshoes of his steed ringing on the stones. The youth now ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain and they did. And as he stepped into the mountain he saw a lovely maiden sitting in the mountainhall winding a golden thread on a golden spindle. The youth went up and greeted the lovely girl. Then the kings daughter was much surprised and said Who are you that dare to venture into the giants hall During all the seven long years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being. And she added For heavens sake hasten away before the troll returns home or else your life will be forfeit But the youth was unafraid and said that he would await the giants return without fear.While they were talking together the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold. When he saw the gate standing open he grew furiously angry and shouted till the whole mountain shook Who has broken my mountain door The youth boldly answered I did and now I shall break you as well Take Hold seize him Tear and Hark tear him into a thousand pieces. No sooner had he spoken than the dogs rushed up fell upon the giant and tore him into countless pieces. Then the princess was happy beyond measure and said God be praised now I am freed And she fell upon the youths neck and gave him a kiss. But he did not wish to stay there any longer saddled the giants colt loaded it with all the gold and gear he found in the mountain and hastily went away with the kings beautiful daughter.They passed on together a long distance. Then one day Hark who always ran ahead scouting came quickly back to his master and told him he had been near a high mountain and had heard the kings second daughter sitting within it winding golden yarn and that the troll himself was not at home. This was very welcome news for the youth and he hurried toward the mountain with his faithful dogs. Now when they drew near Hark said There is no time to lose. The giant is only eight miles away and I can already hear the golden horseshoes of his steed ringing on the stones. The youth at once ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain no matter which way. And when he stepped into the interior of the mountain he saw a lovely maiden sitting in the mountain hall winding golden yarn on a golden windle. The youth went up and greeted the lovely girl. The kings daughter was much surprised and said Who are you that dare to venture into the giants hall During all the seven years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being. And she added For heavens sake hasten away for if the troll comes your life will be forfeit But the youth told her why he had come and said that he would await the trolls return quite undisturbed.While they were still talking together the giant came riding on his steed shod with gold and drew up outside the mountain. When he noticed that the great door was open he grew furiously angry and shouted till the mountain trembled to its very roots. He said Who has broken my mountain door The youth boldly answered I have and now I shall break you as well Take Hold seize him Tear and Hark tear him into a thousand pieces The dogs at once rushed up threw themselves upon the giant and tore him into as many pieces as leaves fall in the autumn. Then the kings daughter was happy beyond measure and cried God be praised now I am freed and she fell upon the youths neck and gave him a kiss. But he led the princess to her sister and one can imaginehow glad they were to see each other again. Then the youth packed up all the treasures he found in the mountain hall loaded them on the giants steed and went his way with the kings two daughters. And they wandered along for a long time. Then one day Hark who always ran ahead scouting came hastily to his master and told him that he had been near a high mountain and had heard the kings third daughter sitting within and weaving a web of gold and that the troll was not at home. This was very welcome news for the youth and he hastened toward the mountain followed by his three dogs. When he drew near Hark said There is no time to lose for the giant is only five miles away. I can already hear the golden horseshoes of his steed ringing on the stones. Then the youth at once ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain by hook or by crook. And when he stepped into the mountain he saw a girl sitting in the mountain hall weaving a web of gold. But this maiden was lovely beyond all measure with a loveliness exceeding all the youth had ever thought to find on earth. He now went up and greeted the lovely maiden. Then the kings daughter was much surprised and said Who are you that dare to venture into the giants hall During all the seven long years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being. And she added For heavens sake hasten away before the troll comes or else your life will be forfeit But the youth was full of confidence and said he would gladly venture his life for the kings lovely daughter.While they were still talking the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold and drew up at the foot of the mountain. When he went in he saw that uninvited guests had arrived and was much frightened for well he knew of the fate that had befallen his brothers. He therefore thought it advisable to fall back upon cunning and treachery for he had not dared to venture on open battle. For that reason he made many fine speeches and was very friendly and smooth with the youth. Then he told the kings daughter to prepare a meal in order to show his guest all hospitality.And since the troll knew so well how to talk the youth allowed himself to be beguiled by his smooth words and forgot to be on his guard. He sat down to the table with the giant but the kings daughter wept secretly and the dogs were very restless though no one paid them any attention.When the giant and his guest had finished their meal the youth said Now that I have satisfied my hunger give me something to quench my thirst The giant replied On the mountaintop is a spring in which bubbles the clearest wine but I have no one to fetch it. The youth answered If that be all that is lacking one of my dogs can go up. Then the giant laughed in his false heart for nothing suited him better than to have the youth send away his dogs. The youth ordered Take Hold to go to the spring and the giant handed him a great tankard. The dog went yet it was easy to see that he did not go willingly and the time passed and passed and he did not return.After a while the giant said I wonder why your dog stays away so long Perhaps you would let another of your dogs go and help him for the way is long and the tankard is heavy. The youth did not suspect any trickery and agreed. He told Tear to go and see why Take Hold had not yet come. The dog wagged his tail and did not want to leave his master. But the youth did not notice it and drove him off himself. Then the giant laughed heartily and the kings daughter wept yet the youth paid no attention but was merry and at his ease played with his sword and dreamed of no danger.Thus a long time passed but nothing was heard of the wine nor of the dogs. Then the giant said I can see that your dogs do not do as you bid them otherwise we should not have to sit here and thirst. I think it would be well if you let Hark go up and see why they do not come back. The youth agreed and told his third dog to hurry to the spring. But Hark did not want to and instead crept whining to his masters feet. Then the youth grew angry and drove him off by force. And when he reached the top of the mountain he shared the fate of the others a high wall rose round about him and he was made a prisoner by the giants magic power.Now that all three dogs were gone the giant rose and suddenly looked altogether different. He took down a long sword from the wall and said Now I will do what my brothers did not do and you must die at once for you are in my power Then the youth was frightened and he regretted he had allowed his dogs to leave him. He said I do not ask for my life since in any event the time will come when I must die. But I would like to repeat the Lords prayer and play a psalm on my flute for such is the custom in my country. The giant granted his prayer but said that he would not wait long. So the youth kneeled and began to blow his flute till it sounded over hill and dale. And that very moment the magic wall was broken and the dogs were freed. They came rushing on like the stormwind and fell upon the mountain troll. The youth at once rose and said Take Hold seize him Tear and Hark tear him into a thousand pieces Then the dogs flung themselves on the giant and tore him into countless pieces. Then the youth took all the treasures that lay in the mountain hitched the giants horses to a gilded wagon and drove off as fast as he could.Now when the kings daughters met again there was great joy as may well be imagined and all thanked the youth for delivering them out of the power of the mountain trolls. But the youth fell deeply in love with the youngest princess and they promised to be true to each other. So the kings daughters passed on their way with music and merriment of every kind and the youth served them with all the honor and courtesy due maidens of gentle birth. And while they were underway the princesses toyed with the youths hair and each tied her golden ring in his locks for remembrance.One day while they were still underway they met two wanderers who were traveling the same road. The clothes of the two strangers were torn and their feet were sore and their whole appearance showed that they had a long journey behind them. The youth stopped his wagon and asked them who they were and whence they came. The strangers answered that they were two princes and had gone forth to search for the three maidens in the mountain. But fortune had not favored them and now they had to return home more like journeymen than kings sons. When the youth heard this he felt sorry for the two wanderers and asked whether they would like to ride with him in his handsome wagon. The princes thanked him profusely for his offer. They drove on together and came to the kingdom over which the father of the princesses reigned.Now when the princes learned that the youth had delivered the kings three daughters a great jealousy took possession of them and they thought of how badly they had fared in their own venture. And they took counsel together as to how they might get the better of the youth and win power and glory for themselves. But they hid their evil plot till a favorable opportunity offered for carrying it out. Then they suddenly threw themselves on their comrade seized him by the throat and strangled him. And then they threatened to kill the princesses if they did not swear to keep silence. And since the kings daughters were in the power of the princes they did not dare say no. But they felt very sorry for the youth who had given up his life for them and the youngest princess mourned with all her heart and all her happiness was at an end.After this great wrong the princes drove to the royal castle and one may well imagine how happy the king was to get back his three daughters. In the meantime the poor youth lay like dead off in a gorge in the forest. Yet he was not quite dead and his faithful dogs lay about him kept him warm and licked his wounds. And they did not stop until their master came back to life again. When he was once more well and strong he set out and after many difficulties came to the royal castle in which the princesses dwelt.When he came in the whole court was full of joy and merriment and from the kings hall came the sound of dancing and string music. That surprised him greatly and he asked what it all meant. The servingman answered You must come from far away since you do not know that the king has regained his daughters who were in the power of the mountain troll. This is the oldest princesss weddingday.The youth then asked after the youngest princess and when she was to marry. But the servingman said that she did not want a husband and wept the livelong day though no one knew why. Then the youth felt happy once more for now he knew that she loved him and had kept faith with him.The youth now went to the keeper of the door and bade him tell the king that a guest had arrived who would add to the merriment of the wedding festivities by showing his dogs. This was to the kings liking and he ordered that the stranger receive the best possible treatment. And when the youth stepped into the hall the whole wedding company were astounded by his skill and his manly bearing and all agreed that so handsome a youth was rarely seen. But no sooner had the kings three daughters recognized him than they jumped up from the table and flung themselves on his neck. And then the princes thought it best to make themselves scarce. But the kings daughters told how the youth had freed them and the rest of their adventures and to make quite certain they looked for their rings among his locks.Now when the king heard of the trickery and treachery the two strange princes had used he grew very angry and had them driven ignominously forth from the castle. But he received the brave youth with great honor as he had deserved and he was married to the kings youngest daughter that selfsame day. After the kings death the youth was chosen king of all the land and a gallant king he was. And there he lives with his beautiful queen and is reigning there happily to this very day. And that is all I have to do with it.
The Nis is the same being that is called Kobold in Germany and Brownie in Scotland. He is in Denmark and Norway also called Nisse god Dreng Niss good lad and in Sweden Tomtegubbe the old man of the house.He is of the dwarf family and resembles them in appearance and like them has the command of money and the same dislike to noise and tumult.His usual dress is grey with a pointed red cap but on Michaelmasday he wears a round hat like those of the peasants.No farmhouse goes on well without there is a Nis in it and well is it for the maids and the men when they are in favour with him. They may go to their beds and give themselves no trouble about their work and yet in the morning the maids will find the kitchen swept up and water brought in and the men will find the horses in the stable well cleaned and curried and perhaps a supply of corn cribbed for them from the neighbours barns.There was a Nis in a house in Jutland. He every evening got his groute at the regular time and he in return used to help both the men and the maids and looked to the interest of the master of the house in every respect.There came one time a mischievous boy to live at service in this house and his great delight was whenever he got an opportunity to give the Nis all the annoyance in his power.Late one evening when everything was quiet in the house the Nis took his little wooden dish and was just going to eat his supper when he perceived that the boy had put the butter at the bottom and had concealed it in hopes that he might eat the groute first and then find the butter when all the groute was gone. He accordingly set about thinking how he might repay the boy in kind. After pondering a little he went up into the loft where a man and the boy were lying asleep in the same bed. The Nis whisked off the bed clothes and when he saw the little boy by the tall man he saidShort and long dont match and with this word he took the boy by the legs and dragged him down to the mans feet. He then went up to the head of the bed andShort and long dont match said he again and then he dragged the boy up to the mans head. Do what he would he could not succeed in making the boy as long as the man but persisted in dragging him up and down in the bed and continued at this work the whole night long till it was broad daylight.By this time he was well tired so he crept up on the window stool and sat with his legs dangling down into the yard. The housedogfor all dogs have a great enmity to the Nisas soon as he saw him began to bark at him which afforded him much amusement as the dog could not get up to him. So he put down first one leg and then the other and teased the dog sayingLook at my little leg. Look at my little legIn the meantime the boy had awoke and had stolen up behind him and while the Nis was least thinking of it and was going on with his Look at my little leg the boy tumbled him down into the yard to the dog crying out at the same timeLook at the whole of him nowThere lived a man in Thyrsting in Jutland who had a Nis in his barn. This Nis used to attend to his cattle and at night he would steal fodder for them from the neighbours so that this farmer had the best fed and most thriving cattle in the country.One time the boy went along with the Nis to Fugleriis to steal corn. The Nis took as much as he thought he could well carry but the boy was more covetous and saidOh take more. Sure we can rest now and thenRest said the Nis. Rest and what is restDo what I tell you replied the boy. Take more and we shall find rest when we get out of this.The Nis took more and they went away with it but when they came to the lands of Thyrsting the Nis grew tired and then the boy said to himHere now is rest and they both sat down on the side of a little hill.If I had known said the Nis as they sat. If I had known that rest was so good Id have carried off all that was in the barn.It happened some time after that the boy and the Nis were no longer friends and as the Nis was sitting one day in the granarywindow with his legs hanging out into the yard the boy ran at him and tumbled him back into the granary. The Nis was revenged on him that very night for when the boy was gone to bed he stole down to where he was lying and carried him as he was into the yard. Then he laid two pieces of wood across the well and put him lying on them expecting that when he awoke he would fall from the fright into the well and be drowned. He was however disappointed for the boy came off without injury.There was a man who lived in the town of Tirup who had a very handsome white mare. This mare had for many years belonged to the same family and there was a Nis attached to her who brought luck to the place.This Nis was so fond of the mare that he could hardly endure to let them put her to any kind of work and he used to come himself every night and feed her of the best and as for this purpose he usually brought a superfluity of corn both thrashed and in the straw from the neighbours barns all the rest of the cattle enjoyed the advantage and they were all kept in exceedingly good condition.It happened at last that the farmhouse passed into the hands of a new owner who refused to put any faith in what they told him about the mare so the luck speedily left the place and went after the mare to a poor neighbour who had bought her. Within five days after his purchase the poor farmer began to find his circumstances gradually improving while the income of the other day after day fell away and diminished at such a rate that he was hard set to make both ends meet.If now the man who had got the mare had only known how to be quiet and enjoy the good times that were come upon him he and his children and his childrens children after him would have been in flourishing circumstances till this very day. But when he saw the quantity of corn that came every night to his barn he could not resist his desire to get a sight of the Nis. So he concealed himself one evening at nightfall in the stable and as soon as it was midnight he saw how the Nis came from his neighbours barn and brought a sack full of corn with him. It was now unavoidable that the Nis should get a sight of the man who was watching so he with evident marks of grief gave the mare her food for the last time cleaned and dressed her to the best of his ability and when he had done turned round to where the man was lying and bid him farewell.From that day forward the circumstances of both the neighbours were on an equality for each now kept his own.
A long long time ago Prince Cuglas master of the hounds to the high King of Erin set out from Tara to the chase. As he was leaving the palace the light mists were drifting away from the hilltops and the rays of the morning sun were falling aslant on the grinan or sunny bower of the Princess Ailinn. Glancing towards it the prince doffed his plumed and jewelled huntingcap and the princess answered his salute by a wave of her little hand that was as white as a wild rose in the hedges in June and leaning from her bower she watched the huntsman until his tossing plumes were hidden by the green waving branches of the woods.The Princess Ailinn was over head and ears in love with Cuglas and Cuglas was over head and ears in love with the Princess Ailinn and he believed that never was summer morning half as bright or as sweet or as fair as she. The glimpse which he had just caught of her filled his heart with delight and almost put all thought of hunting out of his head when suddenly the tuneful cries of the hounds answered by a hundred echoes from the groves broke upon his ear.The dogs had started a dappled deer that bounded away through the forest. The prince spurring his gallant steed pushed on in eager pursuit.On through the forest sped the deer through soft green secret ways and flowery dells then out from the forest up heathery hills and over long stretches of moorland and across brown rushing streams sometimes in view of the hounds sometimes lost to sight but always ahead of them.All day long the chase continued and at last when the sun was sinking the dogs were close upon the panting deer and the prince believed he was about to secure his game when the deer suddenly disappeared through the mouth of a cave which opened before him. The dogs followed at his heels and the prince endeavoured to rein in his steed but the impetuous animal bore him on and soon was clattering over the stony floor of the cave in perfect darkness. Cuglas could hear ahead of him the cries of the hounds growing fainter and fainter as they increased the distance between them and him. Then the cries ceased altogether and the only sound the prince heard was the noise of his horses hoofs sounding in the hollow cave. Once more he endeavoured to check his career but the reins broke in his hands and in that instant the prince felt the horse had taken a plunge into a gulf and was sinking down and down as a stone cast from the summit of a cliff sinks down to the sea. At last the horse struck the ground again and the prince was almost thrown out of his saddle but he succeeded in regaining his seat. Then on through the darkness galloped the steed and when he came into the light the princes eyes were for some time unable to bear it. But when he got used to the brightness he saw he was galloping over a grassy plain and in the distance he perceived the hounds rushing towards a wood faintly visible through a luminous summer haze. The prince galloped on and as he approached the wood he saw coming towards him a comely champion wearing a shining brown cloak fastened by a bright bronze spearlike brooch and bearing a white hazel wand in one hand and a singleedged sword with a hilt made from the tooth of a seahorse in the other and the prince knew by the dress of the champion and by his wand and sword that he was a royal herald. As the herald came close to him the princes steed stopped of his own accord.You are welcome Cuglas said the herald and I have been sent by the Princess Crede to greet you and to lead you to her court where you have been so long expected.I know not how this may be said Cuglas.How it has come about I shall tell you as we go along said the herald. The Princess Crede is the Queen of the Floating Island. And it chanced once upon a day when she was visiting her fairy kinsmen who dwell in one of the pleasant hills that lie near Tara she saw you with the high king and princes and nobles of Erin following the chase. And seeing you her heart went out to you and wishing to bring you to her court she sent one of her nymphs in the form of a deer to lure you on through the cave which is the entrance to this land.I am deeply honoured by the preference shown me by the princess said Cuglas but I may not tarry in her court for above in Erin there is the Lady Ailinn the loveliest of all the ladies who grace the royal palace and before the princess and chiefs of Erin she has promised to be my bride.Of that I know not said the herald but a true champion like you cannot I know refuse to come with me to the court of the Princess Crede.As the herald had said these words the prince and he were on the verge of the wood and they entered upon a mossy pathway that broadened out as they advanced until it was as wide as one of the great roads of Erin. Before they had gone very far the prince heard the tinkling of silver bells in the distance and almost as soon as he heard them he saw coming up towards him a troop of warriors on coal black steeds. All the warriors wore helmets of shining silver and cloaks of blue silk. And on the horses breasts were crescents of silver on which were hung tiny silver bells shaking out music with the motion of the horses. As the prince approached the champions they lowered their spears and dividing in two lines the prince and the herald passed between the ranks and the champions forming again followed on behind the prince.At last they passed through the wood and they found themselves on a green plain speckled with flowers and they had not gone far when the prince saw coming towards him a hundred champions on snowwhite steeds and around the breasts of the steeds were crescents of gold from which were hanging little golden bells. The warriors all wore golden helmets and the shafts of their shining spears were of gold and golden sandals on their feet and yellow silken mantles fell down over their shoulders. And when the prince came near them they lowered their lances and then they turned their horses heads around and marched before him. And it was not long until above the pleasant jingle of the bells the prince heard the measured strains of music and he saw coming towards him a band of harpers dressed in green and gold and when the harpers had saluted the prince they marched in front of the cavalcade playing all the time and it was not long until they came to a stream that ran like a blue riband around the foot of a green hill on the top of which was a sparkling palace the stream was crossed by a golden bridge so narrow that the horsemen had to go twobytwo. The herald asked the prince to halt and to allow all the champions to go before him and the cavalcade ascended the hill the sunlight brightly glancing on helmet and on lance and when it reached the palace the horsemen filed around the walls.When at length the prince and herald crossed the bridge and began to climb the hill the prince thought he felt the ground moving under them and on looking back he could see no sign of the golden bridge and the blue stream had already become as wide as a great river and was becoming wider every second.You are on the floating island now said the herald and before you is the palace of the Princess Crede.At that moment the queen came out through the palace door and the prince was so dazzled by her beauty that only for the golden bracelet he wore upon his right arm under the sleeve of his silken tunic he might almost have forgotten the Princess Ailinn. This bracelet was made by the dwarfs who dwell in the heart of the Scandinavian Mountains and was sent with other costly presents by the King of Scandinavia to the King of Erin and he gave it to the princess and it was the virtue of this bracelet that whoever was wearing it could not forget the person who gave it to him and it could never be loosened from the arm by any art or magic spell but if the wearer even for a single moment liked anyone better than the person who gave it to him that very moment the bracelet fell off from the arm and could never again be fastened on. And when the princess promised her hand in marriage to the Prince Cuglas she closed the bracelet on his arm.The fairy queen knew nothing about the bracelet and she hoped that before the prince was long in the floating island he would forget all about the princess.You are welcome Cuglas said the queen as she held out her hand and Cuglas having thanked her for her welcome they entered the palace together.You must be weary after your long journey said the queen. My page will lead you to your apartments where a bath of the cool blue waters of the lake has been made ready for you and when you have taken your bath the pages will lead you to the banquet hall where the feast is spread.At the feast the prince was seated beside the queen and she talked to him of all the pleasures that were in store for him in fairyland where pain and sickness and sorrow and old age are unknown and where every rosy hour that flies is brighter than the one that has fled before it. And when the feast was ended the queen opened the dance with the prince and it was not until the moon was high above the floating island that the prince retired to rest.He was so tired after his journey and the dancing that he fell into a sound sleep. When he awoke the next morning the sun was shining brightly and he heard outside the palace the jingle of bells and the music of baying hounds and his heart was stirred by memories of the many pleasant days on which he had led the chase over the plains and through the green woods of Tara.He looked out through the window and he saw all the fairy champions mounted on their steeds ready for the chase and at their head the fairy queen. And at that moment the pages came to say the queen wished to know if he would join them and the prince went out and found his steed ready saddled and bridled and they spent the day hunting in the forest that stretched away for miles behind the palace and the night in feasting and dancing.When the prince awoke the following morning he was summoned by the pages to the presence of the queen. The prince found the queen on the lawn outside the palace surrounded by her court.We shall go on the lake today Cuglas said the queen and taking his arm she led him along the waters edge all the courtiers following.When she was close to the water she waved her wand and in a second a thousand boats shining like glass shot up from beneath the lake and set their bows against the bank. The queen and Cuglas stepped into one and when they were seated two fairy harpers took their places in the prow. All the other boats were soon thronged by fairies and then the queen waved her wand again and an awning of purple silk rose over the boat and silken awning of various colours over the others and the royal boat moved off from the bank followed by all the rest and in every boat sat a harper with a golden harp and when the queen waved her wand for the third time the harpers struck the trembling chords and to the sound of the delightful music the boats glided over the sunlit lake. And on they went until they approached the mouth of a gentle river sliding down between banks clad with trees. Up the river close to the bank and under the drooping trees they sailed and when they came to a bend in the river from which the lake could be no longer seen they pushed their prows in against the bank and the queen and Cuglas and all the party left the boats and went on under the trees until they came to a mossy glade.Then the queen waved her wand and silken couches were spread under the trees and she and Cuglas sat on one apart from the others and the courtiers took their places in proper order.And the queen waved her wand again and wind shook the trees above them and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their hands and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to the music of the harps and when they were tired dancing they set out for the boats and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed away over the lake and it was not long until they reached the bank below the fairy palace.Well between hunting in the forest and sailing over the lake and dancing in the greenwood glade and in the banquet hall the days passed but all the time the prince was thinking of the Princess Ailinn and one moonlit night when he was lying awake on his couch thinking of her a shadow was suddenly cast on the floor.The prince looked towards the window and what should he see sitting on the sill outside but a little woman tapping the pane with a golden bodkin.The prince jumped from his couch and opened the window and the little woman floated on the moonbeams into the room and sat down on the floor.You are thinking of the Princess Ailinn said the little woman.I never think of anyone else said the prince.I know that said the little woman and its because of your love for each other and because her mother was a friend to me in the days gone by that I have come here to try and help you but there is not much time for talking the night advances. At the bank below a boat awaits you. Step into it and it will lead you to the mainland and when you reach it you will find before you a path that will take you to the green fields of Erin and the plains of Tara. I know you will have to face danger. I know not what kind of danger but whatever it may be do not draw your sword before you tread upon the mainland for if you do you shall never reach it and the boat will come back again to the floating island and now go and may luck go with you and saying this the little woman climbed up the moonbeams and disappeared.The prince left the palace and descended to the lake and there before him he saw a glistening boat he stepped into it and the boat went on and on beneath the moon and at last he saw the mainland and he could trace a winding pathway going away from the shore. The sight filled his heart with joy but suddenly the milkwhite moonshine died away and looking up to the sky he saw the moon turning fiery red and the waters of the lake shining like silver a moment before took a bloodred hue and a wind arose that stirred the waters and they leaped up against the little boat tossing it from side to side. While Cuglas was wondering at the change he heard a strange unearthly noise ahead of him and a bristling monster lifting its claws above the water in a moment was beside the boat and stuck one of his claws in the left arm of the prince and pierced the flesh to the bone. Maddened by the pain the prince drew his sword and chopped off the monsters claw. The monster disappeared beneath the lake and as it did so the colour of the water changed and the silver moonlight shone down from the sky again but the boat no longer went on towards the mainland but sped back towards the floating island while forth from the island came a fleet of fairy boats to meet it led by the shallop of the fairy queen. The queen greeted the prince as if she knew not of his attempted flight and to the music of the harps the fleet returned to the palace.The next day passed and the night came and again the prince was lying on the couch thinking of the Princess Ailinn and again he saw the shadow on the floor and heard the tapping against the window.And when he opened it the little woman slid into the room.You failed last night she said but I come to give you another chance. Tomorrow the queen must set out on a visit to her fairy kinsmen who dwell in the green hill near the plain of Tara she cannot take you with her for if your feet once touched the green grass that grows in the fruitful fields of Erin she could never bring you back again. And so when you find she has left the palace go at once into the banquet hall and look behind the throne and you will see a small door let down into the ground. Pull this up and descend the steps which you will see. Where they lead to I cannot tell. What dangers may be before you I do not know but this I know if you accept anything no matter what it is from anyone you may meet on your way you shall not set foot on the soil of Erin.And having said this the little woman rising from the floor floated out through the window.The prince returned to his couch and the next morning as soon as he heard the queen had left the palace he hastened to the banquet hall. He discovered the door and descended the steps and he found himself in a gloomy and lonesome valley. Jagged mountains black as night rose on either side and huge rocks seemed ready to topple down upon him at every step. Through broken clouds a watery moon shed a faint fitful light that came and went as the clouds driven by a moaning wind passed over the valley.Cuglas nothing daunted pushed on boldly until a bank of cloud shut out completely the struggling moon and closing over the valley covered it like a pall leaving him in perfect darkness. At the same moment the moaning wind died away and with it died away all sound. The darkness and the deathlike silence sent an icy chill to the heart of Cuglas. He held his hand close to his eyes but he saw it not. He shouted that he might hear the sound of his own voice but he heard it not. He stamped his foot on the rocky ground but no sound was returned to him. He rattled his sword in its brazen scabbard but it gave no answer back to him. His heart grew colder and colder when suddenly the cloud above him was rent in a dozen places and lightning flashed through the valley and the thunder rolled over the echoing mountains. In the lurid glare of the lightning Cuglas saw a hundred ghostly forms sweeping towards him uttering as they came nearer and nearer shrieks so terrible that the silence of death could more easily be borne. Cuglas turned to escape but they hemmed him round and pressed their clammy hands upon his face.With a yell of horror he drew his sword and slashed about him and that very moment the forms vanished the thunder ceased the dark cloud passed and the sun shone out as bright as on a summer day and then Cuglas knew the forms he had seen were those of the wild people of the glen.With renewed courage he pursued his way through the valley and after three or four windings it took him out upon a sandy desert. He had no sooner set foot upon the desert than he heard behind him a crashing sound louder than thunder. He looked around and he saw that the walls of mountain through which he had just passed had fallen into the valley and filled it up so that he could no longer tell where it had been.The sun was beating fiercely on the desert and the sands were almost as hot as burning cinders and as Cuglas advanced over them his body became dried up and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and when his thirst was at its height a fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the burning plain a few paces in front of him but when he came up quite close to it and stretched out his parched hands to cool them in the limped waters the fountain vanished as suddenly as it appeared. With great pain and almost choking with heat and thirst he struggled on and again the fountain sprang up in front of him and moved before him almost within his reach. At last he came to the end of the desert and he saw a green hill up which a pathway climbed but as he came to the foot of the hill there sitting right in his way was a beautiful fairy holding out towards him a crystal cup over the rim of which flowed water as clear as crystal. Unable to resist the temptation the prince seized the cold bright goblet and drank the water. When he did so his thirst vanished but the fairy and the green hill and the burning desert disappeared and he was standing in the forest behind the palace of the fairy queen.That evening the queen returned and at the feast she talked as gaily to the prince as if she knew not of his attempt to leave the Floating Island and the prince spoke as gaily as he could to her although in his heart there was sadness when he remembered that if he had only dashed away the crystal cup he would be at that moment in the royal banquet hall of Tara sitting beside the Princess Ailinn.And he thought the feast would never end but it was over at last and the prince returned to his apartments. And that night as he lay on his couch he kept his eyes fixed upon the window but hours passed and there was no sign of anyone. At long last and when he had given up all hope of seeing her he heard a tapping at the window and he got up and opened it and the little woman came in.You failed again today said shefailed just at the very moment when you were about to step on the green hills of Erin. I can give you only one chance more. It will be your last. The queen will go hunting in the morning. Join the hunt and when you are separated from the rest of the party in the wood throw your reins upon your horses neck and he will lead you to the edge of the lake. Then cast this golden bodkin into the lake in the direction of the mainland and a golden bridge will be thrown across over which you can pass safely to the fields of Erin but take care and do not draw your sword for if you do your steed will bear you back again to the Floating Island and here you must remain for ever. Then handing the bodkin to the prince and saying goodbye the little woman disappeared.The next morning the queen and the prince and all the court went out to hunt and a fleet white deer started out before them and the royal party pressed after him in pursuit. The princes steed outstripped the others and when he was alone the prince flung the reins upon his horses neck and before long he came to the edge of the lake.Then the prince cast the bodkin on to the water and a golden bridge was thrown across to the mainland and the horse galloped on to it and when the prince was more than halfway he saw riding towards him a champion wearing a silver helmet and carrying on his left arm a silver shield and holding in his right hand a gleaming sword. As he came nearer he struck his shield with his sword and challenged the prince to battle. The princes sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the martial sound and like a true knight of Tara he dashed against his foe and swinging his sword above his head with one blow he clove the silver helmet and the strange warrior reeled from his horse and fell upon the golden bridge. The prince content with this achievement spurred his horse to pass the fallen champion but the horse refused to stir and the bridge broke in two almost at his feet and the part of it between him and the mainland disappeared beneath the lake carrying with it the horse and the body of the champion and before the prince could recover from his surprise his steed wheeled round and was galloping back and when he reached the land he rushed through the forest and the prince was not able to pull him up until he came to the palace door.All that night the prince lay awake on his couch with his eyes fixed upon the window but no shadow fell upon the floor and there was no tapping at the pane and with a heavy heart he joined the hunting party in the morning. And day followed day and his heart was sadder and sadder and found no pleasure in the joys and delights of fairyland. And when all in the palace were at rest he used to roam through the forest always thinking of the Princess Ailinn and hoping against hope that the little woman would come again to him but at last he began to despair of ever seeing her. It chanced one night he rambled so far that he found himself on the verge of the lake at the very spot from which the golden bridge had been thrown across the waters and as he gazed wistfully upon them a boat shot up and came swiftly to the bank and who should he see sitting in the stern but the little woman.Ah Cuglas Cuglas she said I gave you three chances and you failed in all of them.I should have borne the pain inflicted by the monsters claw said Cuglas. I should have borne the thirst on the sandy desert and dashed the crystal cup untasted from the fairys hand but I could never have faced the nobles and chiefs of Erin if I had refused to meet the challenge of the battle champion on the golden bridge.And you would have been no true knight of Erin and you would not have been worthy of the wee girl who loves you the bonny Princess Ailinn if you had refused to meet it said the little woman but for all that you can never return to the fair hills of Erin. But cheer up Cuglas there are mossy ways and forest paths and nestling bowers in fairyland. Lonely they are I know in your eyes now said the little woman but maybe she added with a laugh as musical as the ripple on a streamlet when summer is in the air maybe you wont always think them so lonely.You think Ill forget Ailinn for the fairy queen said Cuglas with a sigh.I dont think anything of the kind said she.Then what do you mean said the prince.Oh I mean what I mean said the little woman. But I cant stop here all night talking to you and indeed it is in your bed you ought to be yourself. So now good night and I have no more to say except that perhaps if you happen to be here this night week at this very hour when the moon will be on the waters you will see. But no matter what you will see said she I must be off.And before the prince could say another word the boat sped away from the bank and he was alone. He went back to the palace and he fell asleep that night only to dream of the Princess Ailinn.As for the princess she was pining away in the palace of Tara the colour had fled from her cheeks and her eyes which had been once so bright they would have lighted darkness like a star lost nearly all their lustre and the kings leeches could do nothing for her and at last they gave up all hope and the king and queen of Erin and the ladies of the court watched her couch by night and by day sadly waiting for her last hour.At length one day when the sun was shining brightly over Taras plain and its light softened by the intervening curtains was falling in the sick chamber the royal watchers noticed a sweet change coming over the face of the princess the bloom of love and youth were flushing on her cheeks and from her eyes shone out the old soft tender light and they began to hope she was about to be restored to them when suddenly the room was in darkness as if the night had swept across the sky and blotted out the sun. Then they heard the sound of fairy music and over the couch where the princess lay they beheld a gleam of golden light but only for a moment and again there was perfect darkness and the fairy music ceased. Then as suddenly as it came the darkness vanished the softened sunlight once more filled the chamber and rested upon the couch but the couch was empty and the royal watchers looking at each other said in whispers The fairies have carried away the Princess Ailinn to fairyland.Well that very day the prince roamed by himself through the forest counting the hours until the day would fade in the sky and the moon come climbing up and at last when it was shining full above the waters he went down to the verge of the lake and he looked out over the gleaming surface watching for the vision promised by the little woman. But he could see nothing and was about to turn away when he heard the faint sound of fairy music. He listened and listened and the sound came nearer and clearer and away in the distance like drops of glistening water breaking the level of the lake he saw a fleet of fairy boats and he thought it was the fairy queen sailing in the moonlight. And it was the fairy queen and soon he was able to recognise the royal shallop leading the others and as it came close to the bank he saw the little woman sitting in the prow between the little harpers and at the stern was the fairy queen and by her side the lady of his heart the Princess Ailinn. In a second the boat was against the bank and the princess in his arms. And he kissed her again and again.And have you never a kiss for me said the little woman tapping his hand with the little gold bodkin.A kiss and a dozen said Cuglas as he caught the little fairy up in his arms.Oh fie Cuglas said the queen.Oh the princess isnt one bit jealous said the little woman. Are you AilinnIndeed I am not said Ailinn.And you should not be said the fairy queen for never lady yet had truer knight than Cuglas. I loved him and I love him dearly. I lured him here hoping that in the delights of fairyland he might forget you. It was all in vain. I know now that there is one thing no fairy power above or below the stars or beneath the waters can ever subdue and that is love. And here together forever shall you and Cuglas dwell where old age shall never come upon you and where pain or sorrow or sickness are unknown.And Cuglas never returned to the fair hills of Erin and ages passed away since the morning he followed the hounds into the fatal cave but his story was remembered by the firesides and sometimes even yet the herdboy watching his cattle in the fields hears the tuneful cry of hounds and follows it till it leads him to a darksome cave and as fearfully he listens to the sound becoming fainter and fainter he hears the clatter of hoofs over the stony floor and to this day the cave bears the name of the prince who entered it never to return.
Rejoicing on their tyrants weddingdayThe people drownd their care in drinkWhile from the general joy did sop shrinkAnd showd its folly in this way.The sun said he once took it in his headTo have a partner so he wed.From swamps and ponds and marshy bogsUp rose the wailings of the frogs.What shall we do should he have progenySaid they to DestinyOne sun we scarcely can endureAnd halfadozen we are sureWill dry the very sea.Adieu to marsh and fenOur race will perish thenOr be obliged to fixTheir dwelling in the StyxFor such an humble animalThe frog I take it reasond well.
Some folk say that the Little People the Fairies were once angels that were cast out of Heaven for their sins. They fell to earth and grew smaller and smaller. And today they dance on moonlit nights in Fairy Rings and play all manner of pranks.Be that as it may one night a merry troop of them was capering in the moonshine. On a nice green sward by a rivers bank the little fellows were dancing handinhand with their red caps wagging at every bound. And so light were their feet that the dew trembled but was not disturbed. So they danced spinning around and around and twirling and bobbing and diving until one of them chirpedCease Cease with your hummingHeres an end to your mummingBy my smell I can tellThat a Priest is now comingAnd away all the Fairies scampered as fast as they could. Some hid under the green leaves of the Foxglove their little caps peeping out like crimson bells. Others crept under the shadow of stones or beneath the bank of the river.And scarcely had they done so when along came Father Horrigan riding slowly on his pony. He was thinking to himself that he would end his journey at the first cabin he came to. And so he did for soon he stopped at the little house of Dermod Leary and lifting the latch walked in with A blessing on all hereAnd a welcome guest you may be sure was Father Horrigan for no man was better loved in all that country. But when Dermod saw him enter he was troubled for he had nothing to offer for supper except some potatoes that his wife was boiling in a pot over the fire. Then he remembered that he had set a net in the river. Therell be no harm thought he in my stepping down to see if anything has been caught.So down to the river went Dermod. He found as fine a salmon in the net as ever jumped from water. But as he was taking it out the net was jerked from his hands and away the salmon went swimming along as though nothing had happened.Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake that the fish left shining like a line of silver in the moonlight.May bitter luck attend you night and day cried he shaking his fist. Some evil thing sure it was that helped you for did I not feel it pull the net out of my handYoure all wrong Dermod There were a hundred or more of us pulling against you squeaked a little voice near his feet and the whole troop of Fairieshundreds and hundreds of themcame rushing from their hidingplaces and stood before him their red caps nodding violently.Dermod gazed at them in wonder then one of the Fairies saidMake yourself noways uneasy about the Priests supper Dermod Leary. If you will go back and ask him one question for us therell be as fine a supper spread before him in no time as ever was put on table.Ill have nothing to do with you at all at all answered Dermod I know better than to sell my soul to the likes of youBut the little Fairy was not to be repulsed. Will you ask the Priest just one civil question for us Dermod said he.Dermod considered for a moment. I see no objection said he to the same. But Ill have nothing to do with your supper mind thatThe Little People all crowded near him while the Fairy answeredGo and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether our souls will be saved at the Last Day. And if you wish us well Dermod Leary you will bring the word that he says.Away went Dermod to his cabin.Please your reverence said he to Father Horrigan may I make bold to ask your honour a questionWhat is it said Father Horrigan.Why then said Dermod will the souls of the Little People be saved at the Last DayWho bids you ask that question Leary said Father Horrigan fixing his eyes sternly on Dermod.Ill tell no lies about the matter nothing in life but the truth answered Dermod. Twas the Little People themselves who sent me. They are in thousands down on the bank of the river waiting for your word.Go back said Father Horrigan and tell them that if they want to know they must come here to me themselves and Ill answer that and any other question.So back Dermod hurried to the river. The Fairies came swarming around him. They pressed close to his feet with faces upturned as they anxiously waited. And Dermod brave man that he was spoke out boldly and gave them the Priests message. And when they heard that the whole multitude of little Fairies uttered shrill cries and groans and they whisked past Dermod in such numbers that he was quite bewildered. Then in a trice he found himself alone.He went slowly back to his cabin. He opened the door. The fire was burning brightly. The candles were lighted. And good Father Horrigan was seated comfortably at the table a pitcher of new milk before him and a bit of fresh butter from Dermods cow. And Dermods wife was handing him a big handsome potato whose white mealy insides were bursting through its skin and smoking like a hardridden horse on a frosty night.Dermod sat down at the table and began to eat without a word. And when Father Horrigan was through the good Priest smacked his lips and said that he had relished the hot tasty potatoes more than a dozen fat salmon and a whole Fairy feast
Gold makes a woman pennywhite said the Dutch in the days when fairies were plentiful and often in their thoughts. What did the proverb mean Who ever saw a white pennyWell that was long ago when pennies were white because they were then made of silver. Each one was worth a denary which was a coin worth about a shilling or a quarter of a dollar.As the Dutch had pounds shillings and pence before the English had them we see what d in the signs  s. d. means that is a denary or a white penny made of silver.In the old days before the Dutch had houses with glass windows or clothes of cloth or linen or hats or shoes cows and horses or butter and cheese they knew nothing of money and they cared less. Almost everything even the land was owned in common by all. Their wants were few. Whenever they needed anything from other countries they swapped or bartered. In this way they traded salt for furs or fish for iron. But when they met with or had to fight another tribe that was stronger or richer or knew more than they did they required other things which the forests and waters could not furnish. So by and by pedlars and merchants came up from the south. They brought new and strange articles such as mirrors jewelry clothes and pretty things which the girls and women wanted and had begged their daddies and husbands to get for them. For the men they brought iron tools and better weapons improved traps to catch wild beasts and wagons with wheels that had spokes. When regular trade began it became necessary to have money of some kind.Then coins of gold silver and copper were seen in the towns and villages and even in the woods and on the heaths of Holland. Yet there was a good deal that was strange and mysterious about these round shining bits of metal called money.Money. What is money asked many a proud warrior disdainfully.Then the wise men explained to the fighting men that money was named after Juno Moneta a goddess in Rome. She told men that no one would ever want for money who was honest and just. Then by and by the mint was in her temple and money was coined there. Then later in Holland the word meant money but many people who wanted to get rich quickly worshipped her. In time however the word gold meant money in general.When a great ruler named Charlemagne conquered or made treaties with our ancestors he allowed them to have mints and to coin money. Then again it seemed wonderful how the pedlars and the goldsmiths and the men called Lombardsstrange longbearded men from the south who came among the Dutchgrew rich faster than the work people. They seemed to amass gold simply by handling money.When a man who knew what a silver penny would do made a present of one to his wife her face lighted up with joy. So in time the word penny white meant the smiling face of a happy woman. Yet it was also noticed that the more people had the more they wanted. The girls and boys quickly found that money would buy what the pedlars brought. In the towns shops sprang up in which were many curious things which tempted people to buy.Some tried to spend their money and keep it tooto eat their cake and have it alsobut they soon found that they could not do this. There were still many foolish as well as wise people in the land even during the new time of money. A few saved their coins and were happy in giving some to the poor and needy. Many fathers had what was called a sparpot or home savings bank and taught their children the right use of money. It began to be the custom for people to have family names so that a girl was not merely the daughter of soandso nor a boy the son of a certain father. In the selection of names those which had the word penny in them proved to be very popular. To keep a coin in the little home bank without spending it long enough for it to gather mould which it did easily in the damp climate of Holland that is to darken and get a crust on it was considered a great virtue in the owner. This showed that the owner had a strong mind and power of selfcontrol. So the name Schimmelpennig or mouldy penny became honorable because such people were wise and often kind and good. They did not waste their money but made good use of it.On the other hand were some mean and stingy folks who liked to hear the coins jingle. Instead of wisely spending their cash or trading with it they hoarded their coins that is they hid them away in a stocking or a purse or in a jar or a cracked cooking pot that couldnt be used. Often they put it away somewhere in the chimney behind a loose brick. Then at night when no one was looking these miserly folks counted rubbed jingled and gloated over the shining coins and never helped anybody. So there grew up three sorts of people called the thrifty the spendthrifts and the misers. These last were the meanest and most disliked of all. Others again hid their money away so as to have some when sick or old and they talked about it. No one found fault with these though some laughed and said a penny in the savings jar makes more noise than when it is full of gold. Even when folks got married they were exhorted by the minister to save money so as to have something to give to the poor.Now when the fairies that work down underground heard that the Dutch had learned the use of money and had even built a mint to stamp the metal they held a feast to talk over what they should do to help or harm. In any event they wanted to have some fun with the mortals above ground.That has always been the way with kabouters. They are in for fun first last and always. So with punches and hammers they made counterfeit money. Then in league with the elves they began also to delude misers and make them believe that much money makes men happy.A long time after the mint had been built two kabouters met to talk over their adventures.It is wonderful what fools these creatures called men are said the first one. Theres old Vrek. He has been hoarding coins for the last fifty years. Now he has a pile of gold in guilders and stivers but theres hardly anything of his old self left. His soul is as small as a shrimp. I whispered to him not to let out his money in trade but to keep it shut up. His strong box is full to bursting but what went into the chest has oozed out of the man. He died last night and hardly anybody considers him worth burying. Some one on the street today asked what Vrek had left behind. The answer was Nothinghe took it all with him for he had so little to take.Thats jolly said the older kabouter who was a wicked looking fellow. Ill get some fun out of this. To shrivel up souls will be my business henceforth. Theres nothing like this newfangled business of getting money that will do it so surely.So this ugly old imp went snooping around as the Dutch say about people who sneak and dodge in and out of places to which they ought not to go and in houses where they should not be found. This imps purpose was to make men crazy on the subject of making money when they tried as many of them did to get rich quickly in mean ways. Sorry to tell the imp found a good many promising specimens to work upon at his business of making some wise men foolish. He taught them to take out of their souls what they hoarded away. To such fellows when they became misers he gave the name of Schim which means a shadow. It was believed by some people that such shrivelled up wretches had no bowels.Soon after this a great meeting of kabouters was held in the dark realms below ground. Each one told what he had been doing on the earth. After the little imps had reported the chief kabouter when his turn came cried outI shall tell of three brothers and what each one did with the first silver penny he earned.Go on they all cried.Ive caught one schim young. He married a wife only last year but he wont give her one gulden a year to dress on. He skimps the table pares the cheese till the rind is as thin as paper and makes her live on skim milk and barley. Besides this he wont help the poor with a stiver. I saw him put away a bright and shining silver penny fresh from the mint. He hid coin and pocketbook in the bricks of a chimney. So I climbed down from the roof seized both and ran away. I smeared the purse with wax and hid it in the thick rib of a boat by the wharf. There the penny will gather mould enough. Ha Ha HaAt this the little imps broke out into a titter that sounded like the cackle of a hen trying to tell she had laid an egg.Good for you Serves the old schim right said a good kabouter who loved to help human beings. Now Ill tell you about his brother who has a wife and baby. He feeds and clothes them well and takes good care of his old mother.Almost every week he helps some poor little boy or girl that has no mother or father. I heard him say he wished he could take care of poor orphans. So when he was asleep at night I whispered in his ear and made him dream.Put away your coin where it wont get mouldy and show that a penny that keeps moving is not like a rolling stone that gathers no moss. Deliver it to the goldsmiths for interest and leave it in your will to increase until it becomes a great sum. Then long after you are dead the money you have saved and left for the poor weesies orphans will build a house for them. It will furnish food and beds and pay for nurses that will care for them and good women who will be like mothers. Other folks seeing what you have done will build orphan houses. Then we shall have a Wees House orphan asylum in every town. No child without a father or mother in all Holland will have to cry for milk or bread. Dont let your penny mould.The third brother named Spillpenny woke up on the same morning with a headache. He remembered that he had spent his silver penny at the gin house buying drinks for a lot of worthless fellows like himself. He and his wife with little to eat had to wear ragged clothes and the baby had not one toy to play with. When his wife gently chided him he ran out of the house in bad humor. Going to the tap room he ordered a drink of what we call Dutch courage that is a glass of gin and drank it down. Then what do you think he didTell us cried the imps uproariously.He went into a clothing house bought a suit of clothes and had it charged.Thats it. Ive known others like him said an old imp.Now it was kermiss day in the village and all that afternoon and evening this spendthrift was roystering with his fellow zuip zaks boon companions. With them it was always drunk always dry. Near midnight being too full of gin he stumbled in the gutter struck his head on the curb and fell down senseless.Her husband not coming home that night the distracted wife went out early in the morning. She found several men lying asleep on the sidewalks or in the gutters. She turned each one over just as she did buckwheat cakes on the griddle to see if this man or that was hers. At last she discovered her worthless husband but no shaking or pulling could awake him. He was dead.Now there was a covetous undertaker in town who carted away the corpse and then told the widow that she must spend much money on the funeral in order to have her husband buried properly or else the tongues of the neighbors would wag. So the poor woman had to sell her cow the only thing she had and was left poorer than ever. That was the end of Spillpenny.A jolly story cried the kabouters in chorus. Served him right. Now tell us about Vrek the miser. Go on.Well the saying Much coin much care is hardly true of him for I and my trusty helpers ran away with all he had. With his first silver penny he began to hoard his money. He has been hunting for years for that penny but has not found it. It will be rather mouldy should he find it but that he never will.Why not asked a young imp.For a good reason. He would not pay his boatmen their wages. So they struck and refused to work. When he tried to sail his own boat it toppled over and sunk and Vrek was drowned. His wife was saved the expenses of a funeral for his carcass was never found and the covetous undertaker lost a job.What of the third one they asked.Oh Mynheer Eerlyk you mean No harm can come to him. Everybody loves him and he cares for the orphans. There will be no mouldy penny in his house.Then the meeting broke up. The good kabouters were happy. The bad ones the imps were sorry to miss what they hoped would be a jolly story.When a thousand years passed away and the age of newspapers and copper pennies had come there were no descendants of the two brothers Spillpenny and Schim but of Mynheer Eerlyk there were as many as the years that had flown since he made a will. In this document he ordered that his money in guilders of gold and pennies of silver should remain at compound interest for four hundred years. In time the ever increasing sum passed from the goldsmiths to the bankers and kept on growing enormously. At last this large fortune was spent in building hundreds of homes for orphans.According to his wish each girl in the asylum dressed in clothes that were of the colors on the city arms. In Amsterdam for example each orphan childs frock is half red and half black with white aprons and the linen and lace caps are very neat and becoming to their rosy faces. In Friesland where golden hair and apple blossom cheeks are so often seen with the white lace and linen some one has called the orphan girls Apples of gold in pictures of silver. Among the many glories of the Netherlands is her care for the aged and the orphans.One of the thirty generations of the Eerlyks read one day in the newspaperLast week while digging a very deep canal some workman struck his pickaxe against timbers that were black with age and nearly as hard as stone. These on being brought up showed that they were the ribs of an ancient boat. Learned men say that there was once a river here which long since dried up. All the pieces of the boat were recovered and under the skilful hands of our ship carpenters have been put together and the whole vessel is now set up and on view in our museum.Well go down tomorrow on our way home from school and see the curiosity cried one of the Eerlyk boys clapping his hands.Wait said his father theres more in the story.Today the janitor of the museum while examining a wide crack in one of the ribs which was covered with wax picked this substance away. He poked his finger in the crack and finding something soft pulled it out. It was a rough leather purse inside of which was a coin mouldy with age and dark as the wood. Even after cleaning it with acid it was hard to read what was stamped on it but strange to say the face of the coin had left its impression on the leather which had been covered with wax. From this though the metal of the coin was black and the mould thick on the coin what they saw showed that it was a silver penny of the age of Charlemagne or the ninth century.Charlemagne is French father but we call him Karel de Groot orCharles the Great.Yes my son. Dont you hear Karels Klok the curfew sounding Tis time for little folks to go to bed.
Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters one of them was beautiful and industrious the other ugly and lazy. The mother however loved the ugly and lazy one best because she was her own daughter and so the other who was only her stepdaughter was made to do all the work of the house and was quite the Cinderella of the family.Listen to Mother Holle plus hundreds of other fairy tale audiobooks in the Fairytalez Audio Book App for Apple and Android devicesHer stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in the high road there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune but her stepmother spoke harshly to her and after giving her a violent scolding said unkindly As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow full of sunshine and with countless flowers blooming in every direction.She walked over the meadow and presently she came upon a bakers oven full of bread and the loaves cried out to her Take us out take us out or alas we shall be burnt to a cinder we were baked through long ago. So she took the breadshovel and drew them all out.She went on a little farther till she came to a free full of apples. Shake me shake me I pray cried the tree my apples one and all are ripe. So she shook the tree and the apples came falling down upon her like rain but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.The next thing she came to was a little house and there she saw an old woman looking out with such large teeth that she was terrified and turned to run away. But the old woman called after her What are you afraid of dear child Stay with me if you will do the work of my house properly for me I will make you very happy. You must be very careful however to make my bed in the right way for I wish you always to shake it thoroughly so that the feathers fly about then they say down there in the world that it is snowing for I am Mother Holle. The old woman spoke so kindly that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.She took care to do everything according to the old womans bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as her word she never spoke angrily to her and gave her roast and boiled meats every day.So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time and then she began to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home then she knew she was homesick although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile she went to Mother Holle and said I am so homesick that I cannot stay with you any longer for although I am so happy here I must return to my own people.Then Mother Holle said I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people and as you have served me so well and faithfully I will take you home myself.Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was opened and as the girl passed through a shower of gold fell upon her and the gold clung to her so that she was covered with it from head to foot.That is a reward for your industry said Mother Holle and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.The gate was then closed and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mothers house. As she entered the courtyard the cock who was perched on the well called outCockadoodledooYour golden daughters come back to you.Then she went in to her mother and sister and as she was so richly covered with gold they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all that had happened and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches she thought she should like her ugly lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thornbush so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle then she threw it into the well and jumped in herself.Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow and walked over it till she came to the oven. Take us out take us out or alas we shall be burnt to a cinder we were baked through long ago cried the loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you and walked on.Presently she came to the appletree. Shake me shake me I pray my apples one and all are ripe it cried. But she only answered A nice thing to ask me to do one of the apples might fall on my head and passed on.At last she came to Mother Holles house and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister she was not afraid of them and engaged herself without delay to the old woman.The first day she was very obedient and industrious and exerted herself to please Mother Holle for she thought of the gold she should get in return. The next day however she began to dawdle over her work and the third day she was more idle still then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still she neglected to make the old womans bed properly and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this and thought to herself The gold will soon be mine. Mother Holle led her as she had led her sister to the broad gateway but as she was passing through instead of the shower of gold a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her.That is in return for your services said the old woman and she shut the gate.So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch and the cock on the well called out as she saw herCockadoodledooYour dirty daughters come back to you.But try what she would she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived.
There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heavens name. She greeted him and curtsied and asked what ailed the King since he looked so sad.You cant do anything to help me my good woman said the King its no use telling you.I am not so sure about that said the beggar woman. Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom but he need not mourn on that account she said. The Queen shall have three daughters but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away.When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl the year after she had another and the third year she also had a girl.The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure but although the King was very happy he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door so that the Princesses should not get out.As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents and for all they besought the sentinel it was of no avail go out they must not before they were fifteen years old all of them.So one day not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess the King and the Queen were out driving and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel all three of them that he should let them down into the garden. He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was no snowy weather could come on such a day. Well he didnt think it looked much like it either and if they must go they had better go the soldier said but it must only be for a minute and he himself would go with them and look after them.When they got down into the garden they ran up and down and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away.There was great mourning over the whole country and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose.You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom and a princess into the bargain so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses or even get any tidings of them.When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold and wished them success on their journey.Then came a soldier who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt and told his mother about it.Some witchery must have got hold of you said the woman but you must dream the same thing three nights running else there is nothing in it. And the next two nights the same thing happened he had the same dream and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out.You had better go home again said the King the Princesses are beyond your reach I should say and besides I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left today. You had better come back another time.If I go I must go today said the soldier. Money I do not want I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet he said but it must be a good walletfulas much meat and bacon as I can carry.Yes that he might have if that was all he wanted.So he set off and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant.Where are you going asked the captain when he saw the man in uniform.Im going to try if I can find the Princesses answered the soldier.So are we said the captain and since your errand is the same you may keep company with us for if we dont find them you are not likely to find them either my lad said he.When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high road and took a path into the forest.Where are you going said the captain it is best to follow the high road.That may be said the soldier but this is my way.He kept to the path and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him. Away they went further and further far across big moors and along narrow valleys.And at last it became lighter and when they had got out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came towards them as if he wanted to eat them.What shall we do now said the captain.They say that the bear is fond of meat said the soldier and then he threw a fore quarter to him and so they got past. But when they reached the other end of the bridge they saw a lion which came roaring towards them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them.I think we had better turn rightabout we shall never be able to get past him alive said the captain.Oh I dont think he is so very dangerous said the soldier I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon and I have half a pig in my wallet and then he threw a ham to the lion who began eating and gnawing and thus they got past him also.In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each room was more gorgeous than the other all was glitter and splendour wherever they looked but that did not satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant went round rattling their money and wanted to buy some food but they saw no people nor could they find a crumb of anything in the house so the soldier offered them some food from his wallet which they were not too proud to accept nor did they want any pressing. They helped themselves of what he had as if they had never tasted food before.The next day the captain said they would have to go out shooting and try to get something to live upon. Close to the house was a large forest where there were plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain at home and cook the remainder of the food in the soldiers wallet. In the meantime the captain and the soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to carry it home. When they came to the door they found the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely able to open the door to them.What is the matter with you said the captain. The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were gone a tiny little man with a long beard who went on crutches came in and asked so plaintively for a penny but no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was not able to get hold of it so stiff and stark was he.I pitied the poor old body said the lieutenant and so I bent down to pick up the penny but then he was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable to move a limb.You ought to be ashamed of yourself you one of the kings officers to let an old cripple give you a thrashing and then tell people of it into the bargain said the captain. Pshaw tomorrow Ill stop at home and then youll hear another story.The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out shooting and the captain remained at home to do the cooking and look after the house. But if he fared no worse he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant. In a little while the old man came in and asked for a penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it gone it was and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help him to find it and the captain without giving a thought bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his crutches and every time the captain tried to rise he got a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came home in the evening he still lay on the same spot and could neither see nor speak.The third day the soldier was to remain at home while the other two went out shooting. The captain said he must take care of himself for the old fellow will soon put an end to you my lad said he.Oh there cant be much life in one if such an old crook can take it said the soldier.They were no sooner outside the door than the old man came in and asked for a penny again.Money I have never owned said the soldier but food Ill give you as soon as it is ready said he but if we are to get it cooked you must go and cut the wood.That I cant said the old man.If you cant you must learn said the soldier. I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the woodshed. There he dragged out a heavy log and cut a cleft in it and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened.Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft and youll soon learn how to cut wood said the soldier. In the meantime Ill show you how to use the axe.The old man was not sufficiently cunning and did as he was told he lay down and looked steadily along the log. When the soldier saw the old mans beard had got well into the cleft he struck out the wedge the cleft closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The soldier began to beat him with the axe handle and then swung the axe round his head and vowed that he would split his skull if he did not tell him there and then where the Princesses were.Spare my life spare my life and Ill tell you said the old man. To the east of the house there is a big mound on top of the mound you must dig out a square piece of turf and then you will see a big stone slab. Under that there is a deep hole through which you must let yourself down and youll then come to another world where you will find the Princesses. But the way is long and dark and it goes both through fire and water.When the soldier got to know this he released the old man who was not long in making off.When the captain and lieutenant came home they were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them what had happened from first to last where the Princesses were and how they should find them. They became as pleased as if they had already found them and when they had had some food they took with them a basket and as much rope as they could find and all three set off to the mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old man had told them and underneath they found a big stone slab which it took all their strength to turn over. They then began to measure how deep it was they joined on ropes both two and three times but they were no nearer the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had to join all the ropes they had both the coarse and fine and then they found it reached the bottom.The captain was of course the first who wanted to descend But when I tug at the rope you must make haste to drag me up again he said. He found the way both dark and unpleasant but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope.The lieutenant was the next to try but it fared no better with him. No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him which so frightened him that he also turned back.The soldier then got into the bucket and down he went through fire and water right on till he came to the bottom where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket but went round in a circle feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far far away like the dawn of day and he went on in that direction.When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world.First he came to some cattle which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off and when he had got past them he came to a fine big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper.Oh dear oh dear what are Christian people doing here said the Princess. Heaven preserve you what do you wantI want to set you free and get you out of the mountain said the soldier.Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once he has three heads said she.I do not care if he has four said the soldier. I am here and here I shall remain.Well if you will be so headstrong I must see if I can help you said the Princess.She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in she said. But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table. No it was too heavy he could not even move it. He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn which hung behind the door after that he was just able to stir it so he took another draught and then he could lift it. At last he took a right big draught and he could swing the sword as easily as anything.All at once the troll came home he walked so heavily that the palace shook.Ugh ugh I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house said he.Yes answered the Princess a raven flew past here just now and in his beak he had a human bone which he dropped down the chimney I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it but I suppose it still smells.So it does said the troll.But come and lie down and Ill scratch your heads said the Princess the smell will be gone by the time you wake.The troll was quite willing and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll.The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler and went with the soldier to her sisters so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door.Here you must enter here she is said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall where everything was of pure silver there sat the second sister at a silver spinningwheel.Oh dear oh dear she said. What do you want hereI want to set you free from the troll said the soldier.Pray do not stay but go said the Princess. If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot.That would be awkwardthat is if I dont take his first said the soldier.Well since you will stay she said you will have to creep behind the big brewingvat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens.First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the trolls sword which lay on the table it was much larger and heavier than the first one he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin.Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy rumbling noise that was quite terrible and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in.Ugh ugh he said as soon as he got his noses inside the door. I smell Christian blood and bone in my house.Yes just think A raven came flying past here with a thighbone which he dropped down the chimney said the Princess. I threw it out but the raven brought it back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to clean the room but I suppose the smell is not quite gone she said.No I can smell it well said the troll but he was tired and put his heads in the Princesss lap and she went on scratching them till they all fell asnoring. Then she called the hens and the soldier came and cut off all the six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks.She was no less glad than her elder sister as you may imagine and danced and sang but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went with the soldier across a large courtyard and after walking through many many rooms he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was.She sat at a golden spinningwheel spinning gold yarn and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered till it hurt ones eyes.Heaven preserve both you and me what do you want here said the Princess. Go go else the troll will kill us both.Just as well two as one answered the soldier. The Princess cried and wept but it was all of no use he must and would remain. Since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the trolls sword on the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to move it it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords.He then had to take the horn down from the wall and take three draughts from it but was only just able to stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts he could lift it and when he had taken another three he swung it as easily as if it had been a feather.The Princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. As soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll.All of a sudden they heard such a thundering rambling noise as if the walls and roof were tumbling in.Ugh Ugh I smell Christian blood and bone in my house said the troll sniffing with all his nine noses.Yes you never saw the like Just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. I threw it out but the raven brought it back and this went on for some time said the Princess but she got it buried at last she said and she had both swept and cleaned the place but she supposed it still smelt.Yes I can smell it well said the troll.Come here and lie down in my lap and I will scratch your heads said the Princess. The smell will be all gone when you awake.He did so and when he was snoring at his best she put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could get away to call the hens. The soldier then came in in his stockinged feet and struck at the troll so that eight of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was too short and did not reach far enough the ninth head woke up and began to roar.Ugh Ugh I smell a Christian.Yes here he is answered the soldier and before the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier struck him another blow and the last head rolled along the floor.You can well imagine how glad the Princesses became now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls heads they did not know how they could do enough for him who had saved them. The youngest Princess took off her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home.As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the lieutenant pulled up the Princesses the one after the other. But when they were safely up the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the Princesses for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He thought he would first try them so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the basket was halfway up they cut the rope and the lump of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces flew about his ears.Now we are rid of him they said and threatened the Princesses with their life if they did not say that it was they who had saved them from the trolls. They were forced to agree to this much against their will and especially the youngest Princess but life was precious and so the two who were strongest had their way.When the captain and lieutenant got home with the Princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace. The King was so glad he didnt know which leg to stand on he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure and no mistake. They walked and strutted about the whole of the day as if they were the cocks of the walk since they were now going to have the King for fatherinlaw. For it was understood they should each have whichever of the Princesses they liked and half the kingdom between them. They both wanted the youngest Princess but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use she would not hear or listen to either.They then asked the King if they might have twelve men to watch over her she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself.Yes that they might have and the King himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood.They then began to prepare for the wedding of the two eldest sisters it should be such a wedding as never was heard or spoken of before and there was no end to the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering.In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about down in the other world. He thought it was hard that he should see neither people nor daylight any more but he would have to do something he thought and so for many days he went about from room to room and opened all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there. At last he came to a drawer in a table in which there lay a golden key he tried this key to all the locks he could find but there was none it fitted till he came to a little cupboard over the bed and in that he found an old rusty whistle. I wonder if there is any sound in it he thought and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters and such a large flock of birds swept down that they blackened all the field in which they settled.What does our master want today they asked.If he were their master the soldier said he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. No none of them knew anything about that But our mother has not yet arrived they said if she cant help you no one can.So he whistled once more and shortly heard something flapping its wings far away and then it began to blow so hard that he was carried away between the houses like a wisp of hay across the courtyard and if he had not caught hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown away altogether.A big eaglebigger than you can imaginethen swooped down in front of him.You come rather sharply said the soldier.As you whistle so I come answered the eagle. So he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were.You cant get away from here unless you can fly said the eagle but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for me so that I can have a really good meal I will try and help you. Have you got a knifeNo but I have a sword he said. When the eagle had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill one more for victuals on the journey. Every time I gape you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth she said else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth.He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier could do to hold on and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagles mouth every time she opened it.At last the day began to dawn and the eagle was then almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings but the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at the top of a large pinetree she set off with him again at such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by sea and land wherever they went.Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once.In the meantime everything was ready at the palace and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant were to be married with the two eldest Princesses who however were not much happier than their youngest sister scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning and the nearer the weddingday approached the more sorrowful did they become.At last the King asked what was the matter with them he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. They had to give some answer and so the eldest sister said they never would be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as they had played with in the blue mountain.That thought the King could be easily managed and so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in the country that they should make these checkers for the Princesses. For all they tried there was no one who could make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the palace except one and he was an old infirm man who had not done any work for many years except odd jobs by which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man was so glad to get him for he had not had an apprentice for many a day that he brought out a flask from his chest and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the drink got into his head and when the soldier saw this he persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the King that he would undertake to make the checkers for the Princesses.He was ready to do that on the spot he had made finer and grander things in his day he said. When the King heard there was some one outside who could make the checkers he was not long in coming out.Is it true what you say that you can make such checkers as my daughters want he asked.Yes it is no lie said the goldsmith that he would answer for.Thats well said the King. Here is the gold to make them with but if you do not succeed you will lose your life since you have come and offered yourself and they must be finished in three days.The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off the effects of the drink he was not quite so confident about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his apprentice who had got him into such a scrape while he was drunk. The best thing would be to make short work of himself at once he said for there could be no hope for his life when the best and grandest goldsmiths could not make such checkers was it likely that he could do itDont fret on that account said the soldier but let me have the gold and Ill get the checkers ready in time but I must have a room to myself to work in he said. This he got and thanks into the bargain.The time wore on and the soldier did nothing but lounge about and the goldsmith began to grumble because he would not begin with the work.Dont worry yourself about it said the soldier there is plenty of time If you are not satisfied with what I have promised you had better make them yourself. The same thing went on both that day and the next and when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the soldiers room the whole of the last day he quite gave himself up for lost it was now no use to think any longer about saving his life he thought.But when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and asked what he wanted.Those gold checkers which the Princesses had in the blue mountain said the soldier but youll want something to eat first I suppose I have two ox carcases lying ready for you in the hayloft yonder you had better finish them he said. When the eagle had done she did not tarry and long before the sun rose she was back again with the checkers. The soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep.Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door.What are you after now again asked the soldier. You rush about enough in the day goodness knows If one cannot have peace when one is in bed whoever would be an apprentice here said he.Neither praying nor begging helped that time the goldsmith must and would come in and at last he was let in.And then you may be sure there was soon an end to his wailing.But still more glad than the goldsmith were the Princesses when he came up to the palace with the checkers and gladdest of all was the youngest Princess.Have you made them yourself she asked.No if I must speak the truth it is not I he said but my apprentice who has made them.I should like to see that apprentice said the Princess. In fact all three wanted to see him and if he valued his life he would have to come.He was not afraid either of womenfolk or grandfolk said the soldier and if it could be any amusement to them to look at his rags they should soon have that pleasure.The youngest Princess recognised him at once she pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him gave him her hand and saidGood day and many thanks for all you have done for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the mountain she said to the King. He is the one I will have and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair.It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had behaved and so they had to pay the penalty of their treachery with their lives and that was the end of their grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom and married the youngest Princess.At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long for feast they all could even if they could not find the Princesses and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still.
A Slave ran away from his master by whom he had been most cruelly treated and in order to avoid capture betook himself into the desert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter he came to a cave which he entered and found to be unoccupied. Really however it was a Lions den and almost immediately to the horror of the wretched fugitive the Lion himself appeared.The man gave himself up for lost but to his utter astonishment the Lion instead of springing upon him and devouring him came and fawned upon him at the same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could and in course of time it healed up completely. The Lions gratitude was unbounded he looked upon the man as his friend and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came however when the Slave began to long for the society of his fellowmen and he bade farewell to the Lion and returned to the town. Here he was presently recognised and carried off in chains to his former master who resolved to make an example of him and ordered that he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theatre.On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena and among the rest a Lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect and then the wretched Slave was cast in among them. What was the amazement of the spectators when the Lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight It was his old friend of the cave The audience clamoured that the Slaves life should be spared and the governor of the town marvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast decreed that both should receive their liberty.
The tale of Loku is applied to a large ugly lizard which climbs to the rafters of houses and gives the peculiar cry that suggests its name. This lizard although hideous is harmless it lives on centipedes. Its strange cry may be heard everywhere in the Philippine Islands.Hundreds of years ago a very wicked king named Loku ruled the Philippines. He was cruel and unjust and condemned to death all who refused to do his bidding. He had vast armies and made war on all until his name was feared everywhere.His power was very great. He conquered every nation that opposed him and killed so many people that the god viewing the slaughter from his throne above sent an angel to order him to cease from warfare and to rule the land in peace.Loku was in his palace planning an assault on his neighbors when a soft light filled the chamber and a beautiful angel appeared and delivered the mandate of the master.The cruel king paid no heed but dismissed the holy messenger in scorn. Tell your master said he to deliver his message in person. I do not deal with messengers. I am Loku. All fear my name. I am the great Loku.Hardly had he spoken when the palace shook to its foundations and a mighty voice thundered Is it thus thou Slightest my word Thou art Loku. All shall indeed know thy name. From every crevice thou shalt forever cry it in a form that suits thy ill nature.The courtiers alarmed by the shock rushed to the kings chamber but Loku was nowhere to be found. The royal robes lay scattered on the floor and the only living thing to be seen was an ugly lizard that blinked at them from among the plans on the table.They searched far and wide and when no trace of the king could be found the courtiers divided the kingdom and ruled so wisely and well that there was peace for many years.As for Loku you may still hear him fulfilling his punishment. From crack and crevice tree and shrub he calls his name from dark till dawn Loku Loku LokuAnd he must cry it forever.
Once upon a time there were a King and a Queen who had an only daughter called Hadvor who was fair and beautiful and being an only child was heir to the kingdom. The King and Queen had also a foster son named Hermod who was just about the same age as Hadvor and was goodlooking as well as clever at most things. Hermod and Hadvor often played together while they were children and liked each other so much that while they were still young they secretly plighted their troth to each other.As time went on the Queen fell sick and suspecting that it was her last illness sent for the King to come to her. When he came she told him that she had no long time to live and therefore wished to ask one thing of him which was that if he married another wife he should promise to take no other one than the Queen of Hetland the Good. The King gave the promise and thereafter the Queen died.Time went past and the King growing tired of living alone fitted out his ship and sailed out to sea. As he sailed there came upon him so thick a mist that he altogether lost his bearings but after long trouble he found land. There he laid his ship to and went on shore all alone. After walking for some time he came to a forest into which he went a little way and stopped. Then he heard sweet music from a harp and went in the direction of the sound until he came to a clearing and there he saw three women one of whom sat on a golden chair and was beautifully and grandly dressed she held a harp in her hands and was very sorrowful. The second was also finely dressed but younger in appearance and also sat on a chair but it was not so grand as the first ones. The third stood beside them and was very pretty to look at she had a green cloak over her other clothes and it was easy to see that she was maid to the other two.After the King had looked at them for a little he went forward and saluted them. The one that sat on the golden chair asked him who he was and where he was going and he told her all the story how he was a king and had lost his queen and was now on his way to Hetland the Good to ask the Queen of that country in marriage. She answered that fortune had contrived this wonderfully for pirates had plundered Hetland and killed the King and she had fled from the land in terror and had come hither after great trouble and she was the very person he was looking for and the others were her daughter and maid. The King immediately asked her hand she gladly received his proposal and accepted him at once. Thereafter they all set out and made their way to the ship and after that nothing is told of their voyage until the King reached his own country. There he made a great feast and celebrated his marriage with this woman and after that things are quiet for a time.Hermod and Hadvor took but little notice of the Queen and her daughter but on the other hand Hadvor and the Queens maid whose name was Olof were very friendly and Olof came often to visit Hadvor in her castle. Before long the King went out to war and no sooner was he away than the Queen came to talk with Hermod and said that she wanted him to marry her daughter. Hermod told her straight and plain that he would not do so at which the Queen grew terribly angry and said that in that case neither should he have Hadvor for she would now lay this spell on him that he should go to a desert island and there be a lion by day and a man by night. He should also think always of Hadvor which would cause him all the more sorrow and from this spell he should never be freed until Hadvor burned the lions skin and that would not happen very soon.As soon as the Queen had finished her speech Hermod replied that he also laid a spell on her and that was that as soon as he was freed from her enchantments she should become a rat and her daughter a mouse and fight with each other in the hall until he killed them with his sword.After this Hermod disappeared and no one knew what had become of him the Queen caused search to be made for him but he could nowhere be found. One time when Olof was in the castle beside Hadvor she asked the Princess if she knew where Hermod had gone to. At this Hadvor became very sad and said that she did not.I shall tell you then said Olof for I know all about it. Hermod has disappeared through the wicked devices of the Queen for she is a witch and so is her daughter though they have put on these beautiful forms. Because Hermod would not fall in with the Queens plans and marry her daughter she has laid a spell on him to go on an island and be a lion by day and a man by night and never be freed from this until you burn the lions skin. Besides said Olof she has looked out a match for you she has a brother in the Underworld a threeheaded Giant whom she means to turn into a beautiful prince and get him married to you. This is no new thing for the Queen she took me away from my parents house and compelled me to serve her but she has never done me any harm for the green cloak I wear protects me against all mischief.Hadvor now became still sadder than before at the thought of the marriage destined for her and entreated Olof to think of some plan to save her.I think said Olof that your wooer will come up through the floor of the castle to you and so you must be prepared when you hear the noise of his coming and the floor begins to open and have at hand blazing pitch and pour plenty of it into the opening. That will prove too much for him.About this time the King came home from his expedition and thought it a great blow that no one knew what had become of Hermod but the Queen consoled him as best she could and after a time the King thought less about his disappearance.Hadvor remained in her castle and had made preparations to receive her wooer when he came. One night not long after a loud noise and rumbling was heard under the castle. Hadvor at once guessed what it was and told her maids to be ready to help her. The noise and thundering grew louder and louder until the floor began to open whereupon Hadvor made them take the caldron of pitch and pour plenty of it into the opening. With that the noises grew fainter and fainter till at last they ceased altogether.Next morning the Queen rose early and went out to the Palace gate and there she found her brother the Giant lying dead. She went up to him and said I pronounce this spell that you become a beautiful prince and that Hadvor shall be unable to say anything against the charges that I shall bring against her.The body of the dead Giant now became that of a beautiful prince and the Queen went in again.I dont think said she to the King that your daughter is as good as she is said to be. My brother came and asked her hand and she has had him put to death. I have just found his dead body lying at the Palace gate.The King went along with the Queen to see the body and thought it all very strange so beautiful a youth he said would have been a worthy match for Hadvor and he would readily have agreed to their marriage. The Queen asked leave to decide what Hadvors punishment should be which the King was very willing to allow so as to escape from punishing his own daughter. The Queens decision was that the King should make a big gravemound for her brother and put Hadvor into it beside him.Olof knew all the plans of the Queen and went to tell the Princess what had been done whereupon Hadvor earnestly entreated her to tell her what to do.First and foremost said Olof you must get a wide cloak to wear over your other clothes when you are put into the mound. The Giants ghost will walk after you are both left together in there and he will have two dogs along with him. He will ask you to cut pieces out of his legs to give to the dogs but that you must not promise to do unless he tells you where Hermod has gone to and tells you how to find him. He will then let you stand on his shoulders so as to get out of the mound but he means to cheat you all the same and will catch you by the cloak to pull you back again but you must take care to have the cloak loose on your shoulders so that he will only get hold of that.The mound was all ready now and the Giant laid in it and into it Hadvor also had to go without being allowed to make any defence. After they were both left there everything happened just as Olof had said. The prince became a Giant again and asked Hadvor to cut the pieces out of his legs for the dogs but she refused until he told her that Hermod was in a desert island which she could not reach unless she took the skin off the soles of his feet and made shoes out of that with these shoes she could travel both on land and sea. This Hadvor now did and the Giant then let her get up on his shoulders to get out of the mound. As she sprang out he caught hold of her cloak but she had taken care to let it lie loose on her shoulders and so escaped.She now made her way down to the sea to where she knew there was the shortest distance over to the island in which Hermod was. This strait she easily crossed for the shoes kept her up. On reaching the island she found a sandy beach all along by the sea and high cliffs above. Nor could she see any way to get up these and so being both sad at heart and tired with the long journey she lay down and fell asleep. As she slept she dreamed that a tall woman came to her and said I know that you are Princess Hadvor and are searching for Hermod. He is on this island but it will be hard for you to get to him if you have no one to help you for you cannot climb the cliffs by your own strength. I have therefore let down a rope by which you will be able to climb up and as the island is so large that you might not find Hermods dwellingplace so easily I lay down this clew beside you. You need only hold the end of the thread and the clew will run on before and show you the way. I also lay this belt beside you to put on when you awaken it will keep you from growing faint with hunger.The woman now disappeared and Hadvor woke and saw that all her dream had been true. The rope hung down from the cliff and the clew and belt lay beside her. The belt she put on the rope enabled her to climb up the cliff and the clew led her on till she came to the mouth of a cave which was not very big. She went into the cave and saw there a low couch under which she crept and lay down.When evening came she heard the noise of footsteps outside and became aware that the lion had come to the mouth of the cave and shook itself there after which she heard a man coming towards the couch. She was sure this was Hermod because she heard him speaking to himself about his own condition and calling to mind Hadvor and other things in the old days. Hadvor made no sign but waited till he had fallen asleep and then crept out and burned the lions skin which he had left outside. Then she went back into the cave and wakened Hermod and they had a most joyful meeting.In the morning they talked over their plans and were most at a loss to know how to get out of the island. Hadvor told Hermod her dream and said she suspected there was some one in the island who would be able to help them. Hermod said he knew of a Witch there who was very ready to help anyone and that the only plan was to go to her. So they went to the Witchs cave and found her there with her fifteen young sons and asked her to help them to get to the mainland.There are other things easier than that said she for the Giant that was buried will be waiting for you and will attack you on the way as he has turned himself into a big whale. I shall lend you a boat however and if you meet the whale and think your lives are in danger then you can name me by name.They thanked her greatly for her help and advice and set out from the island but on the way they saw a huge fish coming towards them with great splashing and dashing of waves. They were sure of what it was and thought they had as good reason as ever they would have to call on the Witch and so they did. The next minute they saw coming after them another huge whale followed by fifteen smaller ones. All of these swam past the boat and went on to meet the whale. There was a fierce battle then and the sea became so stormy that it was not very easy to keep the boat from being filled by the waves. After this fight had gone on for some time they saw that the sea was dyed with blood the big whale and the fifteen smaller ones disappeared and they got to land safe and sound.Now the story goes back to the Kings hall where strange things had happened in the meantime. The Queen and her daughter had disappeared but a rat and a mouse were always fighting with each other there. Ever so many people had tried to drive them away but no one could manage it. Thus some time went on while the King was almost beside himself with sorrow and care for the loss of his Queen and because these monsters destroyed all mirth in the hall.One evening however while they all sat dull and downhearted in came Hermod with a sword by his side and saluted the King who received him with the greatest joy as if he had come back from the dead. Before Hermod sat down however he went to where the rat and the mouse were fighting and cut them in two with his sword. All were astonished then by seeing two witches lying dead on the floor of the hall.Hermod now told the whole story to the King who was very glad to be rid of such vile creatures. Next he asked for the hand of Hadvor which the King readily gave him and being now an old man gave the kingdom to him as well and so Hermod became King.Olof married a goodlooking nobleman and that is the end of the story.
Once upon a time there was a wicked widow who had an ugly daughter. She married a second husband who had a beautiful daughter and a son by his first wife. The stepmother hated the two motherless children and used every means to persuade her husband to take them away to the mountains and abandon them as a prey to wild beasts. The poor man loved his children but being frail was unable to resist the frequent importunities and threats of his wife. Therefore one day he put bread in a bag and taking the two children went to the mountains. After a long journey they came to a lonely wilderness. The man said to the childrenSit here and take a little rest and then turning his face away he began to sob bitterly.Father father why are you weeping exclaimed the children and they also began to weep.The man opened the bag and gave them bread which they soon ate.Father said the boy I am thirsty.The man drove his stick into the ground and placing his cloak over the stick saidCome children sit here under the shadow of this cloak I will go and see if there is a fountain near by.The children seated themselves under the cloak while their father disappeared behind the trees and rocks.After waiting a long time the two innocent children grew tired and began to ramble about in search of their father but in vain.Father father they exclaimed but only the echo of the mountains returned them answerFather fatherThe children came back crying Alas alas the stick is here the cloak is here but father is not hereThus they cried for a long time but seeing that nobody appeared they rose up and one of them took the stick and the other the cloak and they began to wander about in the wilderness not knowing where to go. After a long ramble they came to a place where some rainwater had gathered on the ground in a print made by the hoof of a horse.Sister said the little boy I am thirsty I want to drink of this water.No said the maiden do not drank of this water as soon as you drink of it you will become a colt.Soon they came to another print made by the hoof of an ox and the boy saidSister I am thirsty I want to drink.But she would not let him drink saying As soon as you drink of this water you will become a calf.Then they came to another print made by the paw of a bear and the boy wanted to drink but his sister prevented him lest he should become a cub of a bear. Then they came to a track made by the foot of a pig and the boy again wanted to drink but the maiden prevented him lest he should turn into a young pig. Soon they came to a print made by the foot of a wolf but the boy did not yield till they came to one made by the hoof of a lamb.Sister exclaimed the boy I am thirsty I cannot wait any longer I will drink from this at any risk.Alas said the maiden what can I do I am ready to give my life to save you but it is impossible. You will turn into a lamb the moment you drink of this water.The boy drank and was at once changed into a lamb and began to follow his sister bleating. After a long and dangerous journey they found the way to the town and came to their house. The stepmother was angry to see them come back though one of them was now but a lamb. As she had great influence over her husband he used every means to please her. One day she said to himI want to eat meat you must kill your lamb that I may eat it.The sister hearing this at once took her lambbrother and fled secretly to the mountains where sitting on a high rock she spun wool while the lamb grazed safely near her. As she was thus spinning her spindle fell suddenly from her hand and was precipitated into a deep cave. The maiden leaving the lamb grazing went down to find her spindle. Entering the cave she was surprised to see an old fairy woman a dame a thousand years of age who perceiving the maiden exclaimed Maiden neither the bird with its wing nor the snake on its belly can enter here how could you venture to come hitherThe terrified maiden was at a loss for an answer but she replied with a gentle voice Your love brought me here grandmother.The old fairy was pleased with this kind answer and calling the maiden gave her a seat beside herself and inquired of her many things concerning the upper world. The more she talked with the maiden the better she liked her and she saidNow you are hungry let me bring you some fishes to eat.She went into the cave and returned with a plateful of cooked snakes at the sight of which the maiden shuddered with horror and began to weep.What is the matter inquired the old dame why are you weepingNothing at all answered the maiden shyly I remembered my dead mother who was so fond of fish and therefore I wept.Then she told the old dame her sad story and the ill treatment of the wicked stepmother. The fairy woman was very much interested in what the maiden told her and said to herBe seated and let me sleep in your lap. In yonder fireplace there is a ploughshare heated in the fire. When the Black Fairy passes do not waken me but when the RedandGreen Fairy passes at once press the redhot ploughshare on my feet that I may awake.The poor maiden shuddered with fear but she could do nothing but consent. Accordingly the old fairy woman lay down in the maidens lap and slept. Soon a fairy as black as night passed through the cave but the maiden did not stir. After him the RedandGreen Fairy appeared and the whole cave was gilded with his radiant beams. The maiden at once pressed the redhot ploughshare on the feet of the sleeping fairy woman who immediately started up exclaimingOh what is biting my feetThe maiden told her that nothing had bitten her but it was the redhot ploughshare she felt and that it was time to get up. The old dame arose and at once caused the maiden to stand up as the RedandGreen Fairy proceeded whose gleaming rays had such an effect upon her that her hair and garments were all turned to gold and she herself was turned into a fairy maiden. After the RedandGreen Fairy disappeared the maiden kissing the fairy womans hand took leave of her and taking her lambbrother went home. Seeing that the stepmother was not at home she at once took off her golden garments and hiding them in a secret comer put on her old rags. Soon the stepmother entered and seeing the golden hair of the maiden exclaimedHow now little elf what did you do to your hair to turn it into goldThe maiden told her what had taken place. On the following day the stepmother sent her own daughter to the same spot. There on purpose she let her spindle fall and entered the cave as if to pick it up. The fairy woman saw her and taking a dislike to her changed her into an ugly thing so ugly that it is impossible to describe her appearance. She came home and the stepmother seeing her own daughter changed into a form of so great ugliness was the more enraged against the two stepchildren.One day the Prince of that country sent out heralds to proclaim all over his realm that his son was to be married and that the most beautiful maiden in all the land should be his bride. He commanded all the marriageable maidens to assemble in the palace courtyard where the young Prince would make his selection. At the appointed time all the maidens of the land had crowded into the courtyard. The stepmother dressed her own daughter in the best garments and ornaments she could procure veiling her ugly face very carefully however and took her to the courtyard hoping that the Prince would select her for his bride. In order to prevent the orphan maiden from appearing before the Prince the stepmother scattered a measure of wheat in the yard and bade the maiden to pick up the wheat before she returned threatening to beat her to death in case she failed to finish the task. Soon after the stepmother went away however the maiden let loose the chickens which in a moment picked the wheat up to the very last grain and she putting on her golden garments was changed to a fairy maiden so beautiful that she might say to the sun Sun you need not shine for I am shining.Then she went to the Princes courtyard where she was the object of the admiration of all the crowd. But she could not stay very long lest her stepmother should return first and not finding her at home should beat her upon her return so she ran hastily back and hiding her golden garments put on her old rags. But in her haste she had dropped one of her golden slippers in the Princes fountain.Soon the young Prince who had looked at the maidens without making a selection came on horseback leading his animal to the fountain to water him but the horse was frightened by the radiant beams from the slipper. The servants immediately entered the fountain and taking out the slipper gave it to the Prince who seeing it at once declared that the maiden who wore that slipper should be his bride. He and his peers began to search every house and to try the feet of the maidens to find the true owner of the slipper. They had just approached the house of the Golden Maiden when the stepmother took her and hid her in the great kitchen pit which is used as a furnace presenting her own ugly daughter as the owner of the golden slipper. Of course the slipper did not fit. As the Prince and his peers were leaving the house the cock flying from his roost perched on the top of the door and criedGoogooliggoogoo the Golden Maiden is in the pitThe pit was immediately opened and lo the maiden jumped out. The slipper fitted and the maiden taking out her golden garments and the mate of the slipper from the corner where she had hid them put them on and was changed to a fairy maiden. The Prince seeing this embraced her as his bride. Taking the lambbrother with them they went to the Princes palace where their nuptials were celebrated for seven days and seven nights.One day the stepmother took her own daughter and went to the Princes palace to pay a visit to her stepdaughter who conducted them to the Princes orchard for a walk. As they came to the seashore the stepmother saidCome daughters let us take a bath in the sea.No sooner had they entered the sea than the stepmother intending to drown the golden bride pushed her into the deep water. A great fish however chanced to be there and swallowed her. The stepmother at once gathered up the golden dresses of the bride and putting them on her own ugly daughter brought her to the palace. There she left her in the place of the golden bride veiling carefully her ugly face.The true bride remained in the belly of the fish for several days. One day very early in the morning she heard the sexton ringing the bell and inviting the people to church. She cried to him from the belly of the fishSexton sexton who ring your morning bellCrossing your face send the devils to hellFor Gods sake go to the young Prince and tellLet him not kill my lambbrother or sell.The sexton hearing this call repeated several times went and informed the young Prince who had by that time discovered the loss of his fairy bride. He immediately came to the seashore where the sexton had heard the voice. Once more it was repeated and the Prince recognized it as the voice of his bride. He drew his sword and leaped into the sea. Splitting the fishs belly he drew out his bride and taking her in his arms brought her to the palace. Soon he called the stepmother before him sayingNow kind mother which gift do you prefer a nimblefooted horse or a keen swordLet your keen sword stab your enemies answered the stepmother overjoyed with the expectation of a valuable present I will have the nimblefooted horse.I take you at your word said the Prince you shall have the horse.He ordered his men to bind the stepmother and her ugly daughter to the tail of a wild horse. It was done and the horse being whipped carried the two wicked women away to the mountains. They were thrown from stone to stone and from tree to tree until they were dashed into pieces.The wicked persons being punished the Prince celebrated a new nuptial for forty days and forty nights because he had found his lost golden bride. She being released from her rival thenceforth enjoyed a happy life with her lambbrother.Three apples fell from Heavenone for me one for the storyteller and one for him who entertained the company.
Once on a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay high up on the hillside and in the meadow was a barn which he had built to keep his hay in. Now I must tell you there hadnt been much in the barn for the last year or two for every St. Johns night when the grass stood greenest and deepest the meadow was eaten down to the very ground the next morning just as if a whole drove of sheep had been there feeding on it over night. This happened once and it happened twice so at last the man grew weary of losing his crop of hay and said to his sonsfor he had three of them and the youngest was nicknamed Boots of coursethat now one of them must go and sleep in the barn in the outlying field when St. Johns night came for it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten root and blade this year as it had been the last two years. So whichever of them went must keep a sharp lookout that was what their father said.Well the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow trust him for looking after the grass It shouldnt be his fault if man or beast or the fiend himself got a blade of grass. So when evening came he set off to the barn and lay down to sleep but a little on in the night came such a clatter and such an earthquake that walls and roof shook and groaned and creaked then up jumped the lad and took to his heels as fast as ever he could nor dared he once look round till he reached home and as for the hay why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before.The next St. Johns night the man said again it would never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after year in this way so one of his sons must just trudge off to watch it and watch it well too. Well the next oldest son was ready to try his luck so he set off and lay down to sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him but as the night wore on there came on a rumbling and quaking of the earth worse even than on the last St. Johns night and when the lad heard it he got frightened and took to his heels as though he were running a race.Next year the turn came to Boots but when he made ready to go the other two began to laugh and to make game of him sayingYoure just the man to watch the hay that you are you who have done nothing all your life but sit in the ashes and toast yourself by the fire.But Boots did not care a pin for their chattering and stumped away as evening grew on up the hillside to the outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay down but in about an hours time the barn began to groan and creak so that it was dreadful to hear.Well said Boots to himself if it isnt worse than this I can stand it well enough.A little while after came another creak and an earthquake so that the litter in the barn flew about the lads ears. Oh said Boots to himself if it isnt worse than this I daresay I can stand it out.But just then came a third rumbling and a third earthquake so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming down on his head but it passed off and all was still as death about him.Itll come again Ill be bound thought Boots but no it didnt come again still it was and still it stayed but after he had lain a little while he heard a noise as if a horse were standing just outside the barndoor and cropping the grass. He stole to the door and peeped through a chink and there stood a horse feeding away. So big and fat and grand a horse Boots had never set eyes on by his side on the grass lay a saddle and bridle and a full set of armour for a knight all of brass so bright that the light gleamed from it.Ho ho thought the lad its you is it that eats up our hay Ill soon put a spoke in your wheel just see if I dont.So he lost no time but took the steel out of his tinderbox and threw it over the horse then it had no power to stir from the spot and became so tame that the lad could do what he liked with it. So he got on its back and rode off with it to a place which no one knew of and there he put up the horse. When he got home his brothers laughed and asked how he had faredYou didnt lie long in the barn even if you had the heart to go so far as the field.Well said Boots all I can say is I lay in the barn till the sun rose and neither saw nor heard anything I cant think what there was in the barn to make you both so afraid.A pretty story said his brothers but well soon see how you have watched the meadow so they set off but when they reached it there stood the grass as deep and thick as it had been over night.Well the next St. Johns eve it was the same story over again neither of the elder brothers dared to go out to the outlying field to watch the crop but Boots he had the heart to go and everything happened just as it had happened the year before. First a clatter and an earthquake then a greater clatter and another earthquake and so on a third time only this year the earthquakes were far worse than the year before. Then all at once everything was as still as death and the lad heard how something was cropping the grass outside the barndoor so he stole to the door and peeped through a chink and what do you think he saw Why another horse standing right up against the wall and chewing and champing with might and main. It was far finer and fatter than that which came the year before and it had a saddle on its back and a bridle on its neck and a full suit of mail for a knight lay by its side all of silver and as grand as you would wish to see.Ho ho said Boots to himself its you that gobbles up our hay is it Ill soon put a spoke in your wheel and with that he took the steel out of his tinderbox and threw it over the horses crest which stood as still as a lamb. Well the lad rode this horse too to the hidingplace where he kept the other one and after that he went home.I suppose youll tell us said one of his brothers theres a fine crop this year too up in the hayfield.Well so there is said Boots and off ran the others to see and there stood the grass thick and deep as it was the year before but they didnt give Boots softer words for all that.Now when the third St. Johns eve came the two elder brothers still hadnt the heart to lie out in the barn and watch the grass for they had got so scared at heart the nights they lay there before that they couldnt get over the fright but Boots he dared to go and to make a very long story short the very same thing happened this time as had happened twice before. Three earthquakes came one after the other each worse than the one which went before and when the last came the lad danced about with the shock from one barn wall to the other and after that all at once it was still as death. Now when he had laid a little while he heard something tugging away at the grass outside the barn so he stole again to the doorchink and peeped out and there stood a horse close outsidefar far bigger and fatter than the two he had taken before.Ho ho said the lad to himself its you is it that comes here eating up our hay Ill soon stop thatIll soon put a spoke in your wheel. So he caught up his steel and threw it over his horses neck and in a trice it stood as if it were nailed to the ground and Boots could do as he pleased with it. Then he rode off with it to the hidingplace where he kept the other two and then went home. When he got home his two brothers made game of him as they had done before saying they could see he had watched the grass well for he looked for all the world as if he were walking in his sleep and many other spiteful things they said but Boots gave no heed to them only asking them to go and see for themselves and when they went there stood the grass as fine and deep this time as it had been twice before.Now you must know that the king of the country where Boots lived had a daughter whom he would only give to the man who could ride up over the hill of glass for there was a high high hill all of glass as smooth and slippery as ice close by the Kings palace. Upon the tip top of the hill the Kings daughter was to sit with three golden apples in her lap and the man who could ride up and carry off the three golden apples was to have half the kingdom and the Princess to wife. This the King had stuck up on all the churchdoors in his realm and had given it out in many other kingdoms besides. Now this Princess was so lovely that all who set eyes on her fell over head and ears in love with her whether they would or no. So I neednt tell you how all the princes and knights who heard of her were eager to win her to wife and half the kingdom beside and how they came riding from all parts of the world on high prancing horses and clad in the grandest clothes for there wasnt one of them who hadnt made up his mind that he and he alone was to win the Princess.So when the day of trial came which the king had fixed there was such a crowd of princes and knights under the Glass Hill that it made ones head whirl to look at them and everyone in the country who could even crawl along was off to the hill for they were all eager to see the man who was to win the Princess. So the two elder brothers set off with the rest but as for Boots they said outright he shouldnt go with them for if they were seen with such a dirty changeling all begrimed with smut from cleaning their shoes and sifting cinders in the dusthole they said folk would make game of them.Very well said Boots its all one to me. I can go alone and stand or fall by myself.Now when the two brothers came to the Hill of Glass the knights and princes were all hard at it riding their horses till they were all in a foam but it was no good by my troth for as soon as ever the horses set foot on the hill down they slipped and there wasnt one who could get a yard or two up and no wonder for the hill was as smooth as a sheet of glass and as steep as a housewall. But all were eager to have the Princess and half the kingdom. So they rode and slipped and slipped and rode and still it was the same story over again. At last all their horses were so weary that they could scarce lift a leg and in such a sweat that the lather dripped from them and so the knights had to give up trying any more. So the king was just thinking that he would proclaim a new trial for the next day to see if they would have better luck when all at once a knight came riding up on so brave a steed that no one had ever seen the like of it in his born days and the knight had mail of brass and the horse a brass bit in his mouth so bright that the sunbeams shone from it. Then all the others called out to him he might just as well spare himself the trouble of riding at the Hill for it would lead to no good but he gave no heed to them and put his horse at the hill and went up it like nothing for a good way about a third of the height and when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again. So lovely a knight the Princess thought she had never yet seen and while he was riding she sat and thought to herselfWould to heaven he might only come up and down the other side.And when she saw him turning back she threw down one of the golden apples after him and it rolled down into his shoe. But when he got to the bottom of the hill he rode off so fast that no one could tell what had become of him. That evening all the knights and princes were to go before the king that he who had ridden so far up the hill might show the apple which the Princess had thrown but there was no one who had anything to show. One after the other they all came but not a man of them could show the apple.At even the brothers of Boots came home too and had such a long story to tell about the riding up the hill.First of all they said there was not one of the whole lot who could get so much as a stride up but at last came one who had a suit of brass mail and a brass bridle and saddle all so bright that the sun shone from them a mile off. He was a chap to ride just He rode a third of the way up the Hill of Glass and he could easily have ridden the whole way up if he chose but he turned round and rode down thinking maybe that was enough for once.Oh I should so like to have seen him that I should said Boots who sat by the fireside and stuck his feet into the cinders as was his wont.Oh said his brothers you would would you You look fit to keep company with such high lords nasty beast that you are sitting there amongst the ashes.Next day the brothers were all for setting off again and Boots begged them this time too to let him go with them and see the riding but no they wouldnt have him at any price he was too ugly and nasty they said.Well well said Boots if I go at all I must go by myself. Im not afraid.So when the brothers got to the Hill of Glass all the princes and knights began to ride again and you may fancy they had taken care to shoe their horses sharp but it was no goodthey rode and slipped and slipped and rode just as they had done the day before and there was not one who could get so far as a yard up the hill. And when they had worn out their horses so that they could not stir a leg they were all forced to give it up as a bad job. So the king thought he might as well proclaim that the riding should take place the day after for the last time just to give them one chance more but all at once it came across his mind that he might as well wait a little longer to see if the knight in brass mail would come this day too. Well they saw nothing of him but all at once came one riding on a steed far far braver and finer than that on which the knight in brass had ridden and he had silver mail and a silver saddle and bridle all so bright that the sunbeams gleamed and glanced from them far away. Then the others shouted out to him again saying he might as well hold hard and not try to ride up the hill for all his trouble would be thrown away but the knight paid no heed to them and rode straight at the hill and right up it till he had gone twothirds of the way and then he wheeled his horse round and rode down again. To tell the truth the Princess liked him still better than the knight in brass and she sat and wished he might only be able to come right up to the top and down the other side but when she saw him turning back she threw the second apple after him and it rolled down and fell into his shoe. But as soon as ever he had come down from the Hill of Glass he rode off so fast that no one could see what became of him.At even when all were to go in before the king and the Princess that he who had the golden apple might show it in they went one after the other but there was no one who had any apple to show and the two brothers as they had done on the former day went home and told how things had gone and how all had ridden at the hill and none got up.But last of all they said came one in a silver suit and his horse had a silver saddle and a silver bridle. He was just a chap to ride and he got twothirds up the hill and then turned back. He was a fine fellow and no mistake and the Princess threw the second gold apple to him.Oh said Boots I should so like to have seen him too that I should.A pretty story they said. Perhaps you think his coat of mail was as bright as the ashes you are always poking about and sifting you nasty dirty beast.The third day everything happened as it had happened the two days before. Boots begged to go and see the sight but the two wouldnt hear of his going with them. When they got to the hill there was no one who could get so much as a yard up it and now all waited for the knight in silver mail but they neither saw nor heard of him. At last came one riding on a steed so brave that no one had ever seen his match and the knight had a suit of golden mail and a golden saddle and bridle so wondrous bright that the sunbeams gleamed from them a mile off. The other knights and princes could not find time to call out to him not to try his luck for they were amazed to see how grand he was. So he rode right at the hill and tore up it like nothing so that the Princess hadnt even time to wish that he might get up the whole way. As soon as ever he reached the top he took the third golden apple from the Princess lap and then turned his horse and rode down again. As soon as he got down he rode off at full speed and was out of sight in no time.Now when the brothers got home at even you may fancy what long stories they told how the riding had gone off that day and amongst other things they had a deal to say about the knight in golden mail.He just was a chap to ride they said so grand a knight isnt to be found in the wide world.Oh said Boots I should so like to have seen him that I should.Ah said his brothers his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at nasty dirty beast that you are.Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princessit was too late to do so the night before I supposethat he who had the gold apple might bring it forth but one came after another first the Princes and then the knights and still no one could show the gold apple.Well said the king some one must have it for it was something we all saw with our own eyes how a man came and rode up and bore it off.So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well they all came one after another but no one had the golden apple and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadnt come.Oh yes said they we have a brother but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasnt stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days.Never mind that said the king he may as well come up to the palace like the rest.So Boots had to go up to the palace.How now said the king have you got the golden apple Speak outYes I have said Boots here is the first and here is the second and here is the third too and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket and at the same time threw off his sooty rags and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail.Yes said the king you shall have my daughter and half my kingdom for you well deserve both her and it.So they got ready for the wedding and Boots got the Princess to wife and there was great merrymaking at the bridalfeast you may fancy for they could all be merry though they couldnt ride up the Hill of Glass and all I can say is if they havent left off their merrymaking yet why theyre still at it.
There was once a kings son who had a larger and more beautiful collection of books than any one else in the world and full of splendid copperplate engravings. He could read and obtain information respecting every people of every land but not a word could he find to explain the situation of the garden of paradise and this was just what he most wished to know. His grandmother had told him when he was quite a little boy just old enough to go to school that each flower in the garden of paradise was a sweet cake that the pistils were full of rich wine that on one flower history was written on another geography or tables so those who wished to learn their lessons had only to eat some of the cakes and the more they ate the more history geography or tables they knew. He believed it all then but as he grew older and learnt more and more he became wise enough to understand that the splendor of the garden of paradise must be very different to all this. Oh why did Eve pluck the fruit from the tree of knowledge why did Adam eat the forbidden fruit thought the kings son if I had been there it would never have happened and there would have been no sin in the world. The garden of paradise occupied all his thoughts till he reached his seventeenth year.One day he was walking alone in the wood which was his greatest pleasure when evening came on. The clouds gathered and the rain poured down as if the sky had been a waterspout and it was as dark as the bottom of a well at midnight sometimes he slipped over the smooth grass or fell over stones that projected out of the rocky ground. Every thing was dripping with moisture and the poor prince had not a dry thread about him. He was obliged at last to climb over great blocks of stone with water spurting from the thick moss. He began to feel quite faint when he heard a most singular rushing noise and saw before him a large cave from which came a blaze of light. In the middle of the cave an immense fire was burning and a noble stag with its branching horns was placed on a spit between the trunks of two pinetrees. It was turning slowly before the fire and an elderly woman as large and strong as if she had been a man in disguise sat by throwing one piece of wood after another into the flames.Come in she said to the prince sit down by the fire and dry yourself.There is a great draught here said the prince as he seated himself on the ground.It will be worse when my sons come home replied the woman you are now in the cavern of the Winds and my sons are the four Winds of heaven can you understand thatWhere are your sons asked the prince.It is difficult to answer stupid questions said the woman. My sons have plenty of business on hand they are playing at shuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the kings hall and she pointed upwards.Oh indeed said the prince but you speak more roughly and harshly and are not so gentle as the women I am used to.Yes that is because they have nothing else to do but I am obliged to be harsh to keep my boys in order and I can do it although they are so headstrong. Do you see those four sacks hanging on the wall Well they are just as much afraid of those sacks as you used to be of the rat behind the lookingglass. I can bend the boys together and put them in the sacks without any resistance on their parts I can tell you. There they stay and dare not attempt to come out until I allow them to do so. And here comes one of them.It was the North Wind who came in bringing with him a cold piercing blast large hailstones rattled on the floor and snowflakes were scattered around in all directions. He wore a bearskin dress and cloak. His sealskin cap was drawn over his ears long icicles hung from his beard and one hailstone after another rolled from the collar of his jacket.Dont go too near the fire said the prince or your hands and face will be frostbitten.Frostbitten said the North Wind with a loud laugh why frost is my greatest delight. What sort of a little snip are you and how did you find your way to the cavern of the WindsHe is my guest said the old woman and if you are not satisfied with that explanation you can go into the sack. Do you understand meThat settled the matter. So the North Wind began to relate his adventures whence he came and where he had been for a whole month. I come from the polar seas he said I have been on the Bears Island with the Russian walrushunters. I sat and slept at the helm of their ship as they sailed away from North Cape. Sometimes when I woke the stormbirds would fly about my legs. They are curious birds they give one flap with their wings and then on their outstretched pinions soar far away.Dont make such a long story of it said the mother of the winds what sort of a place is Bears IslandA very beautiful place with a floor for dancing as smooth and flat as a plate. Halfmelted snow partly covered with moss sharp stones and skeletons of walruses and polarbears lie all about their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay. It would seem as if the sun never shone there. I blew gently to clear away the mist and then I saw a little hut which had been built from the wood of a wreck and was covered with the skins of the walrus the fleshy side outwards it looked green and red and on the roof sat a growling bear. Then I went to the sea shore to look after birds nests and saw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths and screaming for food. I blew into the thousand little throats and quickly stopped their screaming. Farther on were the walruses with pigs heads and teeth a yard long rolling about like great worms.You relate your adventures very well my son said the mother it makes my mouth water to hear you.After that continued the North Wind the hunting commenced. The harpoon was flung into the breast of the walrus so that a smoking stream of blood spurted forth like a fountain and besprinkled the ice. Then I thought of my own game I began to blow and set my own ships the great icebergs sailing so that they might crush the boats. Oh how the sailors howled and cried out but I howled louder than they. They were obliged to unload their cargo and throw their chests and the dead walruses on the ice. Then I sprinkled snow over them and left them in their crushed boats to drift southward and to taste salt water. They will never return to Bears Island.So you have done mischief said the mother of the Winds.I shall leave others to tell the good I have done he replied. But here comes my brother from the West I like him best of all for he has the smell of the sea about him and brings in a cold fresh air as he enters.Is that the little Zephyr asked the prince.Yes it is the little Zephyr said the old woman but he is not little now. In years gone by he was a beautiful boy now that is all past.He came in looking like a wild man and he wore a slouched hat to protect his head from injury. In his hand he carried a club cut from a mahogany tree in the American forests not a trifle to carry.Whence do you come asked the mother.I come from the wilds of the forests where the thorny brambles form thick hedges between the trees where the watersnake lies in the wet grass and mankind seem to be unknown.What were you doing thereI looked into the deep river and saw it rushing down from the rocks. The water drops mounted to the clouds and glittered in the rainbow. I saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river but the strong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks which flew into the air as the waters dashed onwards leaving the buffalo to be hurled over the waterfall. This pleased me so I raised a storm which rooted up old trees and sent them floating down the river.And what else have you done asked the old woman.I have rushed wildly across the savannahs I have stroked the wild horses and shaken the cocoanuts from the trees. Yes I have many stories to relate but I need not tell everything I know. You know it all very well dont you old lady And he kissed his mother so roughly that she nearly fell backwards. Oh he was indeed a wild fellow. Now in came the South Wind with a turban and a flowing Bedouin cloak.How cold it is here said he throwing more wood on the fire. It is easy to feel that the North Wind has arrived here before me.Why it is hot enough here to roast a bear said the North Wind.You are a bear yourself said the other.Do you want to be put in the sack both of you said the old woman. Sit down now on that stone yonder and tell me where you have been.In Africa mother. I went out with the Hottentots who were lionhunting in the Kaffir land where the plains are covered with grass the color of a green olive and here I ran races with the ostrich but I soon outstripped him in swiftness. At last I came to the desert in which lie the golden sands looking like the bottom of the sea. Here I met a caravan and the travellers had just killed their last camel to obtain water there was very little for them and they continued their painful journey beneath the burning sun and over the hot sands which stretched before them a vast boundless desert. Then I rolled myself in the loose sand and whirled it in burning columns over their heads. The dromedarys stood still in terror while the merchants drew their caftans over their heads and threw themselves on the ground before me as they do before Allah their god. Then I buried them beneath a pyramid of sand which covers them all. When I blow that away on my next visit the sun will bleach their bones and travellers will see that others have been there before them otherwise in such a wild desert they might not believe it possible.So you have done nothing but evil said the mother. Into the sack with you and before he was aware she had seized the South Wind round the body and popped him into the bag. He rolled about on the floor till she sat herself upon him to keep him still.These boys of yours are very lively said the prince.Yes she replied but I know how to correct them when necessary and here comes the fourth. In came the East Wind dressed like a Chinese.Oh you come from that quarter do you said she I thought you had been to the garden of paradise.I am going there tomorrow he replied I have not been there for a hundred years. I have just come from China where I danced round the porcelain tower till all the bells jingled again. In the streets an official flogging was taking place and bamboo canes were being broken on the shoulders of men of every high position from the first to the ninth grade. They cried Many thanks my fatherly benefactor but I am sure the words did not come from their hearts so I rang the bells till they sounded ding dingdong.You are a wild boy said the old woman it is well for you that you are going tomorrow to the garden of paradise you always get improved in your education there. Drink deeply from the fountain of wisdom while you are there and bring home a bottleful for me.That I will said the East Wind but why have you put my brother South in a bag Let him out for I want him to tell me about the phoenixbird. The princess always wants to hear of this bird when I pay her my visit every hundred years. If you will open the sack sweetest mother I will give you two pocketfuls of tea green and fresh as when I gathered it from the spot where it grew.Well for the sake of the tea and because you are my own boy I will open the bag.She did so and the South Wind crept out looking quite cast down because the prince had seen his disgrace.There is a palmleaf for the princess he said. The old phoenix the only one in the world gave it to me himself. He has scratched on it with his beak the whole of his history during the hundred years he has lived. She can there read how the old phoenix set fire to his own nest and sat upon it while it was burning like a Hindoo widow. The dry twigs around the nest crackled and smoked till the flames burst forth and consumed the phoenix to ashes. Amidst the fire lay an egg red hot which presently burst with a loud report and out flew a young bird. He is the only phoenix in the world and the king over all the other birds. He has bitten a hole in the leaf which I give you and that is his greeting to the princess.Now let us have something to eat said the mother of the Winds. So they all sat down to feast on the roasted stag and as the prince sat by the side of the East Wind they soon became good friends.Pray tell me said the prince who is that princess of whom you have been talking and where lies the garden of paradiseHo ho said the East Wind would you like to go there Well you can fly off with me tomorrow but I must tell you one thingno human being has been there since the time of Adam and Eve. I suppose you have read of them in your Bible.Of course I have said the prince.Well continued the East Wind when they were driven out of the garden of paradise it sunk into the earth but it retained its warm sunshine its balmy air and all its splendor. The fairy queen lives there in the island of happiness where death never comes and all is beautiful. I can manage to take you there tomorrow if you will sit on my back. But now dont talk any more for I want to go to sleep and then they all slept.When the prince awoke in the early morning he was not a little surprised at finding himself high up above the clouds. He was seated on the back of the East Wind who held him faithfully and they were so high in the air that woods and fields rivers and lakes as they lay beneath them looked like a painted map.Good morning said the East Wind. You might have slept on a while for there is very little to see in the flat country over which we are passing unless you like to count the churches they look like spots of chalk on a green board. The green board was the name he gave to the green fields and meadows.It was very rude of me not to say goodbye to your mother and your brothers said the prince.They will excuse you as you were asleep said the East Wind and then they flew on faster than ever.The leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they passed. When they flew over seas and lakes the waves rose higher and the large ships dipped into the water like diving swans. As darkness came on towards evening the great towns looked charming lights were sparkling now seen now hidden just as the sparks go out one after another on a piece of burnt paper. The prince clapped his hands with pleasure but the East Wind advised him not to express his admiration in that manner or he might fall down and find himself hanging on a church steeple. The eagle in the dark forests flies swiftly but faster than he flew the East Wind. The Cossack on his small horse rides lightly oer the plains but lighter still passed the prince on the winds of the wind.There are the Himalayas the highest mountains in Asia said the East Wind. We shall soon reach the garden of paradise now.Then they turned southward and the air became fragrant with the perfume of spices and flowers. Here figs and pomegranates grew wild and the vines were covered with clusters of blue and purple grapes. Here they both descended to the earth and stretched themselves on the soft grass while the flowers bowed to the breath of the wind as if to welcome it. Are we now in the garden of paradise asked the prince.No indeed replied the East Wind but we shall be there very soon. Do you see that wall of rocks and the cavern beneath it over which the grape vines hang like a green curtain Through that cavern we must pass. Wrap your cloak round you for while the sun scorches you here a few steps farther it will be icy cold. The bird flying past the entrance to the cavern feels as if one wing were in the region of summer and the other in the depths of winter.So this then is the way to the garden of paradise asked the prince as they entered the cavern. It was indeed cold but the cold soon passed for the East Wind spread his wings and they gleamed like the brightest fire. As they passed on through this wonderful cave the prince could see great blocks of stone from which water trickled hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes. Sometimes it was so narrow that they had to creep on their hands and knees while at other times it was lofty and wide like the free air. It had the appearance of a chapel for the dead with petrified organs and silent pipes. We seem to be passing through the valley of death to the garden of paradise said the prince.But the East Wind answered not a word only pointed forwards to a lovely blue light which gleamed in the distance. The blocks of stone assumed a misty appearance till at last they looked like white clouds in moonlight. The air was fresh and balmy like a breeze from the mountains perfumed with flowers from a valley of roses. A river clear as the air itself sparkled at their feet while in its clear depths could be seen gold and silver fish sporting in the bright water and purple eels emitting sparks of fire at every moment while the broad leaves of the waterlilies that floated on its surface flickered with all the colors of the rainbow. The flower in its color of flame seemed to receive its nourishment from the water as a lamp is sustained by oil. A marble bridge of such exquisite workmanship that it appeared as if formed of lace and pearls led to the island of happiness in which bloomed the garden of paradise. The East Wind took the prince in his arms and carried him over while the flowers and the leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in tones so full and soft that no human voice could venture to imitate. Within the garden grew large trees full of sap but whether they were palmtrees or gigantic waterplants the prince knew not. The climbing plants hung in garlands of green and gold like the illuminations on the margins of old missals or twined among the initial letters. Birds flowers and festoons appeared intermingled in seeming confusion. Close by on the grass stood a group of peacocks with radiant tails outspread to the sun. The prince touched them and found to his surprise that they were not really birds but the leaves of the burdock tree which shone with the colors of a peacocks tail. The lion and the tiger gentle and tame were springing about like playful cats among the green bushes whose perfume was like the fragrant blossom of the olive. The plumage of the woodpigeon glistened like pearls as it struck the lions mane with its wings while the antelope usually so shy stood near nodding its head as if it wished to join in the frolic. The fairy of paradise next made her appearance. Her raiment shone like the sun and her serene countenance beamed with happiness like that of a mother rejoicing over her child. She was young and beautiful and a train of lovely maidens followed her each wearing a bright star in her hair. The East Wind gave her the palmleaf on which was written the history of the phoenix and her eyes sparkled with joy. She then took the prince by the hand and led him into her palace the walls of which were richly colored like a tulipleaf when it is turned to the sun. The roof had the appearance of an inverted flower and the colors grew deeper and brighter to the gazer. The prince walked to a window and saw what appeared to be the tree of knowledge of good and evil with Adam and Eve standing by and the serpent near them. I thought they were banished from paradise he said.The princess smiled and told him that time had engraved each event on a windowpane in the form of a picture but unlike other pictures all that it represented lived and movedthe leaves rustled and the persons went and came as in a lookingglass. He looked through another pane and saw the ladder in Jacobs dream on which the angels were ascending and descending with outspread wings. All that had ever happened in the world here lived and moved on the panes of glass in pictures such as time alone could produce. The fairy now led the prince into a large lofty room with transparent walls through which the light shone. Here were portraits each one appearing more beautiful than the othermillions of happy beings whose laughter and song mingled in one sweet melody some of these were in such an elevated position that they appeared smaller than the smallest rosebud or like pencil dots on paper. In the centre of the hall stood a tree with drooping branches from which hung golden apples both great and small looking like oranges amid the green leaves.It was the tree of knowledge of good and evil from which Adam and Eve had plucked and eaten the forbidden fruit and from each leaf trickled a bright red dewdrop as if the tree were weeping tears of blood for their sin. Let us now take the boat said the fairy a sail on the cool waters will refresh us. But we shall not move from the spot although the boat may rock on the swelling water the countries of the world will glide before us but we shall remain still.It was indeed wonderful to behold. First came the lofty Alps snowclad and covered with clouds and dark pines. The horn resounded and the shepherds sang merrily in the valleys. The bananatrees bent their drooping branches over the boat black swans floated on the water and singular animals and flowers appeared on the distant shore. New Holland the fifth division of the world now glided by with mountains in the background looking blue in the distance. They heard the song of the priests and saw the wild dance of the savage to the sound of the drums and trumpets of bone the pyramids of Egypt rising to the clouds columns and sphinxes overthrown and buried in the sand followed in their turn while the northern lights flashed out over the extinguished volcanoes of the north in fireworks none could imitate.The prince was delighted and yet he saw hundreds of other wonderful things more than can be described. Can I stay here forever asked he.That depends upon yourself replied the fairy. If you do not like Adam long for what is forbidden you can remain here always.I should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge said the prince there is abundance of fruit equally beautiful.Examine your own heart said the princess and if you do not feel sure of its strength return with the East Wind who brought you. He is about to fly back and will not return here for a hundred years. The time will not seem to you more than a hundred hours yet even that is a long time for temptation and resistance. Every evening when I leave you I shall be obliged to say Come with me and to beckon to you with my hand. But you must not listen nor move from your place to follow me for with every step you will find your power to resist weaker. If once you attempted to follow me you would soon find yourself in the hall where grows the tree of knowledge for I sleep beneath its perfumed branches. If you stooped over me I should be forced to smile. If you then kissed my lips the garden of paradise would sink into the earth and to you it would be lost. A keen wind from the desert would howl around you cold rain fall on your head and sorrow and woe be your future lot.I will remain said the prince.So the East Wind kissed him on the forehead and said Be firm then shall we meet again when a hundred years have passed. Farewell farewell. Then the East Wind spread his broad pinions which shone like the lightning in harvest or as the northern lights in a cold winter.Farewell farewell echoed the trees and the flowers.Storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands to accompany him to the boundaries of the garden.Now we will commence dancing said the fairy and when it is nearly over at sunset while I am dancing with you I shall make a sign and ask you to follow me but do not obey. I shall be obliged to repeat the same thing for a hundred years and each time when the trial is past if you resist you will gain strength till resistance becomes easy and at last the temptation will be quite overcome. This evening as it will be the first time I have warned you.After this the fairy led him into a large hall filled with transparent lilies. The yellow stamina of each flower formed a tiny golden harp from which came forth strains of music like the mingled tones of flute and lyre. Beautiful maidens slender and graceful in form and robed in transparent gauze floated through the dance and sang of the happy life in the garden of paradise where death never entered and where all would bloom forever in immortal youth. As the sun went down the whole heavens became crimson and gold and tinted the lilies with the hue of roses. Then the beautiful maidens offered to the prince sparkling wine and when he had drank he felt happiness greater than he had ever known before. Presently the background of the hall opened and the tree of knowledge appeared surrounded by a halo of glory that almost blinded him. Voices soft and lovely as his mothers sounded in his ears as if she were singing to him My child my beloved child. Then the fairy beckoned to him and said in sweet accents Come with me come with me. Forgetting his promise forgetting it even on the very first evening he rushed towards her while she continued to beckon to him and to smile. The fragrance around him overpowered his senses the music from the harps sounded more entrancing while around the tree appeared millions of smiling faces nodding and singing. Man should know everything man is the lord of the earth.The tree of knowledge no longer wept tears of blood for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars.Come come continued that thrilling voice and the prince followed the call. At every step his cheeks glowed and the blood rushed wildly through his veins. I must follow he cried it is not a sin it cannot be to follow beauty and joy. I only want to see her sleep and nothing will happen unless I kiss her and that I will not do for I have strength to resist and a determined will.The fairy threw off her dazzling attire bent back the boughs and in another moment was hidden among them.I have not sinned yet said the prince and I will not and then he pushed aside the boughs to follow the princess. She was lying already asleep beautiful as only a fairy in the garden of paradise could be. She smiled as he bent over her and he saw tears trembling out of her beautiful eyelashes.Do you weep for me he whispered. Oh weep not thou loveliest of women. Now do I begin to understand the happiness of paradise I feel it to my inmost soul in every thought. A new life is born within me. One moment of such happiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe. He stooped and kissed the tears from her eyes and touched her lips with his.A clap of thunder loud and awful resounded through the trembling air. All around him fell into ruin. The lovely fairy the beautiful garden sunk deeper and deeper. The prince saw it sinking down in the dark night till it shone only like a star in the distance beneath him. Then he felt a coldness like death creeping over him his eyes closed and he became insensible.When he recovered a chilling rain was beating upon him and a sharp wind blew on his head. Alas what have I done he sighed I have sinned like Adam and the garden of paradise has sunk into the earth. He opened his eyes and saw the star in the distance but it was the morning star in heaven which glittered in the darkness.Presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of the forest close to the cavern of the Winds and the mother of the Winds sat by his side. She looked angry and raised her arm in the air as she spoke. The very first evening she said. Well I expected it If you were my son you should go into the sack.And there he will have to go at last said a strong old man with large black wings and a scythe in his hand whose name was Death. He shall be laid in his coffin but not yet. I will allow him to wander about the world for a while to atone for his sin and to give him time to become better. But I shall return when he least expects me. I shall lay him in a black coffin place it on my head and fly away with it beyond the stars. There also blooms a garden of paradise and if he is good and pious he will be admitted but if his thoughts are bad and his heart is full of sin he will sink with his coffin deeper than the garden of paradise has sunk. Once in every thousand years I shall go and fetch him when he will either be condemned to sink still deeper or be raised to a happier life in the world beyond the stars.
Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen had a son whose name was Dumalawi. When the son had become a young man his father one day was very angry with him and tried to think of some way in which to destroy him. The next morning he said to DumalawiSon sharpen your knife and we will go to the forest to cut some bamboo.So Dumalawi sharpened his knife and went with his father to the place where the bamboo grew and they cut many sticks and sharpened them like spears at the end.Dumalawi wondered why they made them thus but when they had finished Aponitolau saidNow Son you throw them at me so that we can see which is the braver.No Father answered Dumalawi. You throw first if you want to kill me.So Aponitolau threw the bamboo sticks one by one at his son but he could not hit him. Then it was the sons turn to throw but he saidNo I cannot. You are my father and I do not want to kill you.So they went home. But Dumalawi was very sorrowful for he knew now that his father wanted to destroy him. When his mother called him to dinner he could not eat.Although he had been unsuccessful in his first attempt Aponitolau did not give up the idea of getting rid of his son and the next day he saidCome Dumalawi we will go to our little house in the field and repair it so that it will be a protection when the rainy season sets in.The father and son went together to the field and when they reached the little house Aponitolau pointing to a certain spot in the ground saidDig there and you will find a jar of basi which I buried when I was a boy. It will be very good to drink now.Dumalawi dug up the jar and they tasted the wine and it was so pleasing to them that they drank three cocoanut shells full and Dumalawi became drunk. While his son lay asleep on the ground Aponitolau decided that this was a good time to destroy him so he used his magical power and there arose a great storm which picked up Dumalawi in his sleep and carried him far away. And the father went home alone.Now when Dumalawi awoke he was in the middle of a field so wide that whichever way he looked he could not see the end. There were neither trees nor houses in the field and no living thing except himself. And he felt a great loneliness.By and by he used his magical power and many betelnuts grew in the field and when they bore fruit it was covered with goldThis is good said Dumalawi for I will scatter these betelnuts and they shall become people who will be my neighbors.So in the middle of the night he cut the goldcovered betelnuts into many small pieces which he scattered in all directions. And in the early morning when he awoke he heard many people talking around the house and many roosters crowed. Then Dumalawi knew that he had companions and upon going out he walked about where the people were warming themselves by fires in their yards and he visited them all.In one yard was a beautiful maiden Dapilisan and after Dumalawi had talked with her and her parents he went on to the other yards but she was ever in his thoughts. As soon as he had visited all the people he returned to the house of Dapilisan and asked her parents if he might marry her. They were unwilling at first for they feared that the parents of Dumalawi might not like it but after he had explained that his father and mother did not want him they gave their consent and Dapilisan became his bride.Soon after the marriage they decided to perform a ceremony for the spirits. So Dapilisan sent for the betelnuts which were covered with gold and when they were brought to her she saidYou betelnuts that are covered with gold come here and oil yourselves and go and invite all the people in the world to come to our ceremony.So the betelnuts oiled themselves and went to invite the people in the different towns.Soon after this Aponibolinayen the mother of Dumalawi sat alone in her house still mourning the loss of her son when suddenly she was seized with a desire to chew betelnut.What ails me she said to herself why do I want to chew I had not intended to eat anything while Dumalawi was away.So saying she took down her basket that hung on the wall and saw in it a betelnut covered with gold and when she was about to cut it it saidDo not cut me for I have come to invite you to the ceremony which Dumalawi and his wife are to make.Aponibolinayen was very happy for she knew now that her son still lived and she told all the people to wash their hair and prepare to go to the rite. So they washed their clothes and their hair and started for the home of Dumalawi and Aponitolau the father of the boy followed but he looked like a crazy man. When the people reached the river near the town Dumalawi sent alligators to take them across but when Aponitolau got on the alligators back it dived and he was thrown back upon the bank of the river. All the others were carried safely over and Aponitolau who was left on the bank alone shouted as if crazy until Dumalawi sent another alligator to carry him across.Then Dumalawi had food brought and Dapilisan passed basi in a little jar that looked like a fist and though each guest drank a cupful of the sweet wine the little jar was still a third full. After they had eaten and drunk Aponibolinayen spoke and telling all the people that she was glad to have Dapilisan for a daughterinlaw addedNow we are going to pay the marriage price according to our custom. We shall fill the spirit house nine times with different kinds of jars.Then she called You spirits who live in different springs get the jars which Dumalawi must pay as a marriage price for DapilisanThe spirits did as they were commanded and when they brought the jars and had filled the spirit house nine times Aponibolinayen said to the parents of DapilisanI think that now we have paid the price for your daughter.But Dalonagan the mother of Dapilisan was not satisfied and saidNo there is still more to pay.Very well replied Aponibolinayen. Tell us what it is and we will pay it.Then Dalonagan called a pet spider and saidYou big spider go all around the town and as you go spin a thread on which Aponibolinayen must string golden beads. So the spider spun the thread and Aponibolinayen again called to the spirits of the springs and they brought golden beads which they strung on the thread. Then Dalonagan hung on the thread and when it did not break she declared that the debt was all paid.After this the people feasted and made merry and when at last they departed for home Dumalawi refused to go with his parents but remained with his wife in the town he had created.

One day Juans father sent him to get some ripe guavas for a number of the neighbors had come in and he wanted to give them something to eat.Juan went to the guava bushes and ate all the fruit he could hold and then he decided to play a joke on his fathers guests instead of giving them a feast of guavas. A wasps nest hung near by. With some difficulty he succeeded in taking it down and putting it into a tight basket that he had brought for the fruit. He hastened home and gave the basket to his father and then as he left the room where the guests were seated he closed the door and fastened it.As soon as Juans father opened the basket the wasps flew over the room and when the people found the door locked they fought to get out of the windows. After a while Juan opened the door and when he saw the swollen faces of the people he cried.What fine rich guavas you must have had They have made you all so fat.
Among Hinds especially among Brhmas of the Madras Presidencyand I now see from personal observation that it is the same in the Bombay Presidency alsothere is a custom while taking their meals of leaving their food uneaten when it so happens that from any cause the light is blown out. Of course this could occur only in the nighttime. Such mishaps nowadays take place only in poor families sitting down to supper with a single light. Hence the following story told as the origin of this custom is beginning to be forgotten. It runs as followsIn a certain village there lived a Brhma who had an only daughter. She was deeply read in Saskit and was of the most charming beauty. He procured a husband for her as deeply read as herself. The betrothal had already taken place the muhrta or auspicious time for her marriage was fixed at the tenth ghaikAn Indian hour  24 min. of that night. On that very evening the soninlaw went to a tank to perform his Sandhy vandana or evening prayers. It swarmed with crocodiles. People never went near it. The soninlaw being quite new to the village entered the tank without knowing anything of the danger. Unfortunately there was none near to warn him. He had set his foot in the water when a crocodile caught him by the leg and began to drag him into the water. That very night was fixed for his nuptials and a crocodile was taking him to feast on his flesh. He was extremely horrified at his position and said humbly to his enemy My friend crocodile Listen to my words first and then decide for yourself. A wife the only daughter of an old Brhma is waiting for me tonight. If you eat me now you take me away without my seeing her my fatherinlaw and other relatives. Their hearts may break at the news of my death on the very day of the wedding. They may all curse you. If on the contrary you leave me now I shall go home speak to my wife and others about the sad calamity that has come over me and after embracing and taking leave of her will come to you for your supper at the fifteenth ghaik. Till then leave me. The cruel crocodile though very fond of human flesh and himself dying of hunger spared him for a few ghaiks at his humble request. After extracting several oaths from him that he would return in accordance to his promise the crocodile went into the water.The soninlaw also went home. All his joy vanished how could he be happy after his promise to the crocodile. Still to give no uneasiness to the aged parents of his wife he underwent all the ceremonies of the marriage. Only five more ghaiks remained for him to live in the world as he thought. He in a few words explained everything to his wife and asked her permission to leave her. She showed no sign of sorrow preached to him about the iron hand of fate and that he must undergo what was written on his forehead. She most willingly gave him permission to go and he returned to the tank even a ghaik earlier and called the crocodile who came and seized him.At this moment a certain light glittered before the eyes of the crocodile and vanished. It was a woman that did it. The wife after consoling her husband and preaching to him about the supremacy of fate had accompanied him unobserved with a lighted lamp concealed in a vessel. Just when the crocodile applied its teeth to the leg of her husband she took the lamp out flashed it before the crocodiles eyes and quenched it. Nor was it without its intended effect. The crocodile left the husband to himself and said You had better go now I will never touch you after seeing a lamp extinguished when I began my meal today. The husband was astonished at the device of his wife and still more at the faithful observance of a rule in an unreasonable beast. From that day it was fixed that men who are still more reasonable should never eat when the lamp is blown out.Another story is told. In a remote village there lived a poor woman who laboured from morning till night in different houses and returned to her hut with two measures of rice. That quantity would serve for ten ordinary persons. Being extremely poor she used to keep no lamp but cook her rice in the dark only guided by the light of the fire. When she sat down for her meal even the light of the fire faded so she had to eat in the dark. Though she used the full two measures of rice that she brought away every day her hunger was never satisfied she was always in extreme want.Now it so happened that she had a younger sister who was somewhat richer than herself. The younger came to see her elder sister. The former never used to be without a light and so asked her sister to buy some oil that night and light a lamp. The elder was compelled by necessity to do so for that she devoted a portion of her two measures of rice and returned home with great uneasiness and perplexity of mind as to how less than two measures would furnish their supper that night while full two measures were found insufficient on former occasions for herself alone. The lamp was set for the first time in her house and she cooked the remaining rice. The younger sister was astonished to see her using so much for two. The elder thinking within herself that the younger would soon see her mistake cooked everything. Two leaves were spread and they sat down to their supper. Not even a fourth part of the rice in the pot was consumed but already they were satisfied. The younger sister laughed at the foolishness of her elder who now said I do not know what magic you have in you. Every day I cook two measures of rice and fast the whole night without finding them sufficient for myself. Now a fourth of less than two measures has satiated both. Please explain the cause. The younger sister who was very intelligent herself wanted to find out the cause and asked next day if she might serve the meals without the lamp. Instead of eating she stretched out her hand and caught hold of a lock of hair. She asked the other at once to light the lamp which being done they found a devil sitting by their side. On being questioned how he came there he said that he was in the habit of going to every one who ate without a lamp and swallowing his meals fast without leaving him a morsel. The elder sister perceived her mistake and used a lamp from that day. The demon ceased to come. She had abundance for herself and something to spare. So when the lamp is blown out devils are said to come and eat out of our leaves. Hence the custom of rising whenever such mishaps occur.
nce upon a time there was a husband and a wife. The husband was a tailor so was the wife and in addition was a good housekeeper. One day the husband found some things in the kitchen brokenpots glasses plates. He asked How were they broken How do I know answered the wife. What do you mean by saying how do I know Who broke them Who broke them I with the scissors said the wife in anger. With the scissors With the scissors Are you telling the truth I want to know what you broke them with. If you dont tell me I will beat you. With the scissors for she had the scissors in her hand. Scissors do you say Scissors they were Ah what do you mean Wait a bit I will make you see whether it was you with the scissors.So he tied a rope around her and began to lower her into the well saying Come how did you break them You see I am lowering you into the well. It was the scissors The husband seeing her so obstinate lowered her into the well and she for all that did not hold her tongue. How did you break them said the husband. It was the scissors. Then her husband lowered her more until she was half way down. What did you do it with It was the scissors. Then he lowered her until her feet touched the water. What did you do it with It was the scissors Then he let her down into the water to her waist. What did you do it with It was the scissors Take care cried her husband enraged at seeing her so obstinate it will take but little to put you under the water. You had better tell what you did it with it will be better for you. How is it possible to break pots and dishes with the scissors What has become of the pieces if they were cut It was the scissors the scissorsThen he let go the rope. Splash his wife is all under the water. Are you satisfied now Do you say any longer that it was with the scissors The wife could not speak any more for she was under the water but what did she do She stuck her hand up out of the water and with her fingers began to make signs as if she were cutting with the scissors. What could the poor husband do He said I am losing my wife and then I shall have to go after her. I will pull her out now and she may say that it was the scissors or the shears. Then he pulled her out and there was no way of making her tell with what she had broken all those things in the kitchen.
Between the Baltic and the North Sea there lies an old swans nest wherein swans are born and have been born that shall never die.In olden times a flock of swans flew over the Alps to the green plains around Milan where it was delightful to dwell. This flight of swans men called the Lombards.Another flock with shining plumage and honest eyes soared southward to Byzantium the swans established themselves there close by the Emperors throne and spread their wings over him as shields to protect him. They received the name of Varangians.On the coast of France there sounded a cry of fear for the bloodstained swans that came from the North with fire under their wings and the people prayed Heaven deliver us from the wild Northmen.On the fresh sward of England stood the Danish swan by the open seashore with the crown of three kingdoms on his head and he stretched out his golden sceptre over the land. The heathens on the Pomerian coast bent the knee and the Danish swans came with the banner of the Cross and with the drawn sword.That was in the very old times you say.In later days two mighty swans have been seen to fly from the nest. A light shone far through the air far over the lands of the earth the swan with the strong beating of his wings scattered the twilight mists and the starry sky was seen and it was as if it came nearer to the earth. That was the swan Tycho Brahe.Yes then you say but in our own daysWe have seen swan after swan soar by in glorious flight. One let his pinions glide over the strings of the golden harp and it resounded through the North. Norways mountains seemed to rise higher in the sunlight of former days there was a rustling among the pine trees and the birches the gods of the North the heroes and the noble women showed themselves in the dark forest depths.We have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble crag so that it burst and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the stone stepped out to the sunny day and men in the lands round about lifted up their heads to behold these mighty forms.We have seen a third swan spinning the thread of thought that is fastened from country to country round the world so that the word may fly with lightning speed from land to land.And our Lord loves the old swans nest between the Baltic and the North Sea. And when the mighty birds come soaring through the air to destroy it even the callow young stand round in a circle on the margin of the nest and though their breasts may be struck so that their blood flows they bear it and strike with their wings and their claws.Centuries will pass by swans will fly forth from the nest men will see them and hear them in the world before it shall be said in spirit and in truth This is the last swanthe last song from the swans nest.
A Peddler drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his Ass making a false step fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot and regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass again playing the fool fell down on purpose when he reached the stream but the sponges became swollen with water greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him for he now carried on his back a double burden.
Deereeree was a widow and lived in a camp alone with her four little girls. One day Bibbee came and made a camp not far from hers. Deereeree was frightened of him too frightened to go to sleep. All night she used to watch his camp and if she heard a sound she would cry aloud Deerceree wyah wyah Deereeree Sometimes she would be calling out nearly all night.In the morning Bibbee would come over to her camp and ask her what was the matter that she had called out so in the night. She told him that she thought she heard some one walking about and was afraid for she was alone with her four little girls.He told her she ought not to be afraid with all her children round her. But night after night she sat up crying Wyah wyah Deereeree Deereeree.At last Bibbee said If you are so frightened marry me and live in my camp. I will take care of you. But Deereeree said she did not want to marry. So night after night was to be heard her plaintive cry of Wyah wyah Deereeree Deereeree. And again and again Bibbee pressed her to share his camp and marry him. But she always refused. The more she refused the more he wished to marry her. And he used to wonder how he could induce her to change her mind.At last he thought of a plan of surprising her into giving her consent. He set to work and made a beautiful and many coloured arch which when it was made he called Euloowirree and he placed it right across the sky reaching from one side of the earth to the other. When the rainbow was firmly placed in the sky and showing out in all its brilliancy of many colours as a roadway from the earth to the stars Bibbee went into his camp to wait. When Deereeree looked up at the sky and saw the wonderful rainbow she thought something dreadful must be going to happen. She was terribly frightened and called aloud Wyah wyah. In her fear she gathered her children together and fled with them to Bibbees camp for protection.Bibbee proudly told her that he had made the rainbow just to show how strong he was and how safe she would be if she married him. But if she would not she would see what terrible things he would make to come on the earth not just a harmless and beautiful roadway across the heavens but things that would burst from the earth and destroy it.So by working on her mixed feelings of fear of his prowess and admiration of his skill Bibbee gained his desire and Deereeree married him. And when long afterwards they died Deereeree was changed into the little willy wagtail who may be heard through the stillness of the summer nights crying her plaintive wail of Deereeree wyah wyah Deereeree.And Bibbee was changed into the woodpecker or climbing tree bird who is always running up trees as if he wanted to be building other ways to the than the famous roadway of his Euloowirree the building of which had won him his wife.
The wild people who dwell in the SouthWest are masters of many black arts. They often lure men of the Middle Kingdom to their country by promising them their daughters in marriage but their promises are not to be trusted. Once there was the son of a poor family who agreed to labor for three years for one of the wild men in order to become his soninlaw. At the end of that time the wedding was celebrated and the couple were given a little house for a home. But no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard since her parents did not like him and would seek to do him harm. In accordance with the custom she entered the house first with a lighted lantern but when the bridegroom followed her she had disappeared. And thus it went day by day. During the daytime she was there but when evening came she disappeared.And one day not long after they had been married his wife said to him Tomorrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday and you must go to congratulate her. They will offer you tea and food. The tea you may drink but be sure not to touch any of the food. Keep this in mindSo the following day the wife and husband went to her mothers home and offered their congratulations. Her parents seemed highly pleased and served them with tea and sweets. The soninlaw drank but ate nothing though his wifes parents with kind words and friendly gestures kept urging him to help himself. At last the soninlaw did not know what to do and thought that surely they could mean him no ill. And seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him he ate a little of them. His wife gave him a reproachful glance and he offered some excuse for taking his leave.But his motherinlaw said This is my birthday. You simply must taste my birthday noodlesWith that she placed a great dish before him filled with noodles that looked like threads of silver mingled with fat meat and spiced with fragrant mushrooms. During all the time he had been living in the country the soninlaw had never yet seen such an appetizing dish. Its pleasant odor rose temptingly to his nostrils and he could not resist raising his chopsticks. His wife glanced over at him but he pretended that he did not see her.She coughed significantly but he acted as though he did not hear. Finally she trod on his foot under the table and then he regained control of himself.He had not as yet eaten half of the food and said My hunger is satisfied.Then he took leave and went off with his wife.This is a serious matter said the latter. You would not listen to my words and now you will surely have to dieBut still he did not believe her until he suddenly felt terrible pains which soon grew unbearable so that he fell to the ground unconscious. His wife at once hung him up by the feet from the beam of the roof and put a panful of glowing charcoal under his body and a great jar of water into which she had poured sesame oil in front of the fire directly below his mouth. And when the fire had heated him thoroughly he suddenly opened his mouthand can you imagine what came out of it A squirming crawling mass of poisonous worms centipedes toads and tadpoles who all fell into the jar of water. Then his wife untied him carried him to bed and gave him wine mingled with realgar to drink. Then he recovered.What you ate in the belief that they were eels and crabs said his wife were nothing but toads and tadpoles and the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes. But you must continue to be careful. My parents know that you have not died and they will think up other evil plans.A few days later his fatherinlaw said to him There is a large tree growing on the precipice which juts over the cave. In it is the nest of the phenix. You are still young and able to climb so go there quickly and fetch me the eggsHis soninlaw went home and told his wife.Take long bamboo poles said she and tie them together and fasten a curved sword at the top. And take these nine loaves of bread and these hens eggs there are seven times seven of them. Carry them along with you in a basket. When you come to the spot you will see a large nest up in the branches. Do not climb the tree but chop it down with the curved sword. Then throw away your poles and run for dear life. Should a monster appear and follow you throw him the loaves of bread three loaves at a time and finally throw down the eggs on the ground and make for home as quickly as you can. In this way you may escape the danger which threatens you.The man noted all she said exactly and went. And sure enough he saw the birds nestit was as large as a round pavilion. Then he tied his curved sword to the poles chopped at the tree with all his strength laid down his poles on the ground and never looked around but ran for dear life. Suddenly he heard the roaring of a thunderstorm rising above him. When he looked up he saw a great dragon many fathoms long and some ten feet across. His eyes gleamed like two lamps and he was spitting fire and flame from his maw. He had stretched out two feelers and was feeling along the ground. Then the man swiftly flung the loaves into the air. The dragon caught them and it took a little time before he had devoured them. But no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon once more came flying after him. Then he flung him more loaves and when the loaves came to an end he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled over the ground. The dragon had not yet satisfied his hunger and opened his greedy jaws wide. When he suddenly caught sight of the eggs he descended from the air and since the eggs were scattered round about it took some time before he had sucked them all. In the meantime the man succeeded in escaping to his home.When he entered the door and saw his wife he said to her amid sobs It was all I could do to escape and I am lucky not to be in the dragons stomach If this sort of thing keeps up much longer I am bound to dieWith these words he kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life.Where is your home asked his wife.My home is about a hundred miles away from here in the Middle Kingdom and my old mother is still living. The only thing that worries me is that we are so poor.His wife said I will flee with you and we will find your mother. And waste no regrets on your poverty.With that she gathered up all the house held in the way of pearls and precious stones put them in a bag and had her husband tie it around his waist. Then she also gave him an umbrella and in the middle of the night they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder and stole away.His wife had also said to him Take the umbrella on your back and run as fast as ever you can Do not open it and do not look around I will follow you in secret.So he turned North and ran with all his might and main. He had been running for a day and a night had covered nearly a hundred miles and passed the boundaries of the wild peoples country when his legs gave out and he grew hungry. Before him lay a mountain village. He stopped at the village gate to rest drew some food from his pocket and began to eat. And he looked around without being able to see his wife.Said he to himself Perhaps she has deceived me after all and is not coming with meAfter he had finished eating he took a drink from a spring and painfully dragged himself further. When the heat of the day was greatest a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall. In his haste he forgot what his wife had told him and opened his umbrella. And out fell his wife upon the ground.She reproached him Once more you have not listened to my advice. Now the damage has been doneQuickly she told him to go to the village and there to buy a white cock seven black teacups and half a length of red nettlecloth.Do not be sparing of the silver pieces in your pocket she cried after him as he went off.He went to the village attended to everything and came back. The woman tore the cloth apart made a coat of it and put it on. No sooner had they walked a few miles before they could see a red cloud rising up in the South like a flying bird.That is my mother said the woman.In a moment the cloud was overhead. Then the woman took the black teacups and threw them at it. Seven she threw and seven fell to earth again. And then they could hear the mother in the cloud weeping and scolding and thereupon the cloud disappeared.They went on for about four hours. Then they heard a sound like the noise of silk being torn and could see a cloud as black as ink which was rushing up against the wind.Alas that is my father said the woman. This is a matter of life and death for he will not let us be Because of my love for you I will now have to disobey the holiest of lawsWith these words she quickly seized the white cock separated its head from its body and flung the head into the air. At once the black cloud dissolved and her fathers body the head severed from the trunk fell down by the edge of the road. Then the woman wept bitterly and when she had wept her fill they buried the corpse. Thereupon they went together to her husbands home where they found his old mother still living. They then undid the bag of pearls and jewels bought a piece of good ground built a fine house and became wealthy and respected members of the community.Note Realgar The Chinese believe that realgar is a mithridate and tonic.
Once upon a time something happened. If it hadnt happened it wouldnt be told.There was once a poor widow so poor that even the flies would not stay in her house and this widow had two children a boy and a girl. The boy was such a brave fellow that he would have torn the snakes tongues out of their mouths and the girl was so beautiful that the emperors sons and handsome princes of every land were waiting impatiently for her to grow up that they might go and court her. But when the girl had reached her sixteenth year the same thing befell her that happens to all beautiful maidensa dragon came stole her and carried her far away to the shore of another country. From that day the widow loved her son hundreds and thousands of times better than before because he was now her only child and the sole joy she had in the world. She watched him like the apple of her eye and would not let him go a single step away from her. But much as she loved him she was cheerless and sad for dear me a boy is only a boy but a girl is a girl especially when she is beautiful.The boy seeing his mother so melancholy tried to grow stronger and stronger and counted the days before he should be large enough to go out into the world and seek his sister little Rosy Cheeks along untrodden paths filled with thorns. When he had reached his eighteenth year he made himself a pair of calfskin sandals with steel soles went to his mother and saidMother I have neither rest nor peace here so long as I see you so sick and sorrowful from constantly thinking of my sister I have determined to go out into the wide world and not return till I can bring news of her. I dont know whether I shall find her but at least I hope so and that hope I leave with you for your consolation.When the widow heard these words she was forced to struggle with her feelings ere she answered Well my son my child Do what you can not help doing when you return I shall see you again and if you dont come back I shall not weep for you because the journey you have in view is a long one therefore if you are absent a long time there will always be the hope of your return.After saying this she mixed three loaves for him with her own milk one of meal the second of bran and the third of ashes from the hearth. The lad put the loaves into his knapsack bade his mother farewell and went out into the world like a poor boy to whom all roads are equally long all bridges equally wide and who does not know what direction to take. At the gate he stood still cast one glance to the east one to the west one to the north and one to the south then took a handful of dust from under the threshold of the door scattered it on the wind and turned his steps in the direction that it was carried by the breeze.The Poor Boy walked and walked further and further through many a rich country till he came to a moor on which no grass grew and no water flowed. Here he stopped and pulled out his three loaves. He began with the one made of meal because it was the handsomest and as he ate it his strength increased and his thirst was quenched. Again the Poor Boy walked on journeying across the wide moor a whole long summer day until nightfall when he reached a vast forest as extensive as the heath he had passed but which was dense gloomy and forsaken even by the winds. When he entered the wood he saw by the trunk of a tree an old woman with a bent figure and a wrinkled face. The Poor Boy who for so long a time had seen no human countenance and heard no human speech was greatly delighted and said merrilyGood luck mother But how do you happen to come here and what are you doing in this wilderness of a forestYour words are kind replied the old woman sighing. Alas age has brought me down to this I wanted to walk a little distance and can go no further because my feet will no longer carry me.When the Poor Boy heard this he pitied the old woman went up to her and asked whence she came where she was going and on what business she was bent. The luckless fellow did not know that this person was no other than the Wood Witch who waits on the edge of forests and meets those who wander in these desolate regions in order to delude them with fair words and then lead them to destruction. When he saw her so feeble the boy remembered his three loaves and as if he were going home the very next day thought he would share his provisions with her that she might get a little strength.I thank you replied the Wood Witch who had other designs upon him in her mind but see I have no teeth to chew your dry bread. If you want to do any thing to help me take me on your back and carry me I live close by.But just taste it said the boy who in his kindness of heart wanted to do her some good. It is only hunger that has made you so weak and if this doesnt help you Ill carry you as you wish.When the Wood Witch saw the loaf made of meal she gazed at it with delight there was something about itI dont know whatthat made even the Wood Witch long for a morsel. And as she bit into it her heart grew softer. After she had eaten three mouthfuls she felt as if she were a human being like the rest of us with her heart in the right place and a gentle temper.Learn my son she said to him that I am the Wood Witch and know very well who you are whence you come and where you are going. It is a great task you have before you for your sister is in the other world which inhabitants of this earth can reach only in one way.And what is that asked the Poor Boy impatiently.The Wood Witch looked doubtfully at him.I dont advise you to take it she said it would be a pity to lose your young life. But who knows perhaps youll have good luck I see that you have a tender heart and whoever has that can bring many things to pass besides I know youyou will have no rest till you have found her. So learnfar away from here after you have crossed six moors and six forests you will meet on the edge of the seventh forest which extends to the frontiers of the next world an old witch this witch has a drove of horses and among them is an enchanted horse which can carry you to the other shore. But this steed can be obtained only by the person who knows how to choose it from the whole drove after he has served the old witch for a year.This was what the Poor Boy had wanted to know. He lost no more time thanked the Wood Witch for her explanations and set off keeping straight through the dense forest because his road was long and he was in a hurry. The Poor Boy walked like one who goes on a good errand and hurried like a person who wants to get home early. How far he walked and how much he hurried any one can imagine who remembers how long a time he himself required to cross a single moor and a single forest. But when his strength failed he bit off a piece of his loaf and instantly revived again.As he came out of the sixth forest and passed near the clear waves of a brook he saw a wasp struggling in the water and pitied the insect. So he took a dry branch and held out one end of it to the wasp that it might crawl up on it and then use its wings. But this wasp happened to be the queen of all the wasps in the woods and when she found herself saved by the boys kindness she flew upon his shoulder and saidWherever you go may goodluck be your companion. Please pull out a hair from under my right wing and take good care of it for who knows whether it will not prove useful to you some day. If you need me shake this hair and Ill come to you in whatever part of the world you may be.The Poor Boy pulled out the hair put it carefully away and journeyed on. Who knows how far he walked before he came to a great lake on whose shore he saw a fish flapping on the dry land. He pitied the poor creature which had scarcely a breath of life left so he picked it up and tossed it into the water. But this fish was king of all the fishes and had jeweled scales and golden fins. It swam once around the lake breathed two or three times to recover its strength and then came back to the boy and saidWherever you go may goodluck be your companion. Please pull off a scale from under my right fin and keep it carefully who knows whether it may not be useful to you some day. If you ever need me rub this scale and Ill come to you wherever you may be as far as the water extends around the earth.The Poor Boy took the scale put it carefully away and journeyed on. Who knows how far he walked ere he reached the seventh moor where no grass grew and no water flowed. There he found in his path a mole which had been surprised above ground by the daylight and was now groping piteously about in its blindness unable to find its burrow where its children were starving though it was only one jump away. The youth pitied the mole too took it and carried it to its hill.Wherever you go said the mole may goodluck be your companion. Please take a claw from my right paw and keep it carefully who knows whether it may not be useful to you some day. But if you need me scratch on the ground with this claw and I will come to you in whatever part of the earth you may be.The Poor Boy took the claw put it carefully away and went on again over the endless moor toward the invisible forest that lay on the frontiers of the other world. How many days and nights he journeyed over this moor heaven only knows but one morning when he woke he saw in the distance as far off as if it were in the other world a streak of light like the fire shepherds build at the entrance of the fold. This was the home of the witch who had the enchanted horse.The Poor Boy was greatly delighted when he found himself so near the end of the world and his joy increased till on the evening of the third day he reached the enchantresss house. Oh dear there he was in the midst of the moor just at the edge of the forest which stretched far beyond his sight in the dusk of twilight upon a wide plain covered with green grass through which flowed streams of clear water but in the middle of this plain rose a number of tall poles on each of which was a human skull. The witchs hut stood in the midst of these poles with a tall poplar in front of it and on the right and left a willow tree. This proved that the Wood Witch was rightlife here was by no means merry. The Poor Boy plucked up his courage and approached to enter the hut which stood as if deserted in the middle of the moor.The old witch sat on a high threelegged chair in the entry but before her stood a huge kettle on a big tripod over a fire that burned without smoke. In one hand she held the shinbone of a giant which she used to stir the herbs stewing in the caldron. When the Poor Boy bade her good evening she eyed him from top to toe.Welcome my hero Ive expected you a long time for this caldron has long been rattling and telling me continually that you were on the way.The lad was much pleased with this kind reception for the old woman did not seem to him at all peevish as she looked kindly at him and spoke in a gentle voice. She too was glad because she had again laid hands on a man for the poles bearing human skulls protected her from the malicious elves who could not pass through them and there was still one piece of ground large enough for three heads where poles had not yet been put.They now agreed that the Poor Boy should watch the drove a whole year and in payment receive the horse he himself should choose but if he should lose the drove he was to give up his head to the witch. The old woman instantly stuck a pole in the ground and put the heros hat on it. Then the youth ate something that he might not go with the drove to the pasture hungry. While the boy was eating the witch led the mares behind the hut and began to beat them with the giants shin bone telling them not to drink any water during the night nor allow the others to do so because the water from the springs in the plain would put them to sleep and the old woman wanted the herd to graze all night. The boy knew nothing about this.When he came to the pasture with the drove he was attacked by so great a thirst that he would have walked from morning till night to find a drop of water so to quench it he lay down by a spring and drank and even while drinking he fell asleep.When in the first gray dawn of the next morning he woke from his slumber the drove had vanished leaving no trace anywhere It is only necessary to remember that the lads cap was already hanging on the pole to understand how great was his despair. But he gazed around him in every direction without discovering even a sign of a horse the morning twilight was fast vanishing and he stood utterly forsaken not knowing which way to turn. Then he recollected the service he had once rendered the wasp and thought that a wasp flies so fast that it might discover the drove and bring him news of their hidingplace so he took the hair he had pulled from under the wasps right wing and shook it. Quick as thought a buzzing noise was heard from every directionit grew louder and louder till one might have thought the world was going to ruin. Good gracious There came one wasp after another one swarm behind another whole ranks great clouds of wasps of all sizes all ready to circle the earth and obey the Poor Boys commands.Have no anxiety said the Wasp Queen if the drove still remains on the earth well bring the horses back to you ere sunrise.Then every thing became quiet because the wasps flew off to every quarter of the globe and scattered all over the world. Ere long a cloud of dust appeared in the distance swept with mad haste over the wide plain in the midst of the moor and the drove of horses urged by the wasps stings dashed up so swiftly that the earth fairly groaned under their hoofs. The Poor Boy thanked the wasps for their help and then went to the hut as if nothing had happened.The old woman looked askance at him said he had done well and then beat the mares again ordering them to hide carefully at night. That evening the lad would eat nothing because he thought the witchs food had caused his terrible thirst the night before but when he went with the drove to the pasture a burning consuming thirst seized upon him as soon as he saw the clear water and wherever he went springs bubbled from under his feet. At last he could no longer control himself and relying upon the aid of the wasps lay down beside a spring and had scarcely drunk when he instantly fell asleep. This time he woke later than on the night before because he had gone to sleep later so he was later in shaking the hair he had pulled out from under the wasps wing and the swarms of wasps were later in coming to seek and drive the horses home.But what did the youth see Ere long one swarm after another returned each bringing news that the drove could not be found on the surface of the earth and must have hidden somewhere in the sea.The sun was about to rise. The Poor Boy took the fishscale rubbed it and suddenly there appeared in the springs at his feet a school of tiny fish that filled every channel and asked what were his wishes and commands. He told them what he desired and instantly all the waters on the earth rivers lakes and seas began to swell and dash while the wasps flew off to be ready to pounce upon the drove as soon as the fish forced the horses to appear.The Poor Boy had scarcely time to collect his horses and take them home when the sun rose.The old woman looked angrily at him but said again that he had done well and gave the mares a still more terrible beating for the year consisted of three days and if they did not hide successfully that night the hero might demand his wages.The Poor Boy knew this too. So he began to eat his mealloaf as he went with the drove to the pasture and whenever he bit off a piece his strength increased and his thirst was quenched. Yet whenever he saw the springs or heard the water rippling over the pebbles he grew thirsty again and so devoured the whole of the mealloaf. He ought now to have taken the bran loaf but did not venture to do so because he still had a long journey before him and was afraid of being without food. Therefore he again relied on the aid of the wasps and fishes lay down by a spring and as soon as he had drunk fell asleep.When he awoke it was broad daylight though the sun had not yet risen. He shook the hair but the wasps came with the tidings that the drove was not on the surface of the earth he rubbed the fishscale but the fishes said the horses were not under the water either so in his despair he seized the moles claw and scratched on the ground with it.Then you should have seen the wonder The wasps buzzed the fish searched all the water in the world and the moles began to rummage the earth furrowing it in every direction as if they meant to make it into pap. When the first sunbeams touched the top of the poplar before the hut the drove dashed like hunted ghosts to the Poor Boy if the horses tried to go into the water the fish scared them back if they tried to hide themselves in the ground the claws of the moles drove them out and so they were forced to go wherever the wasps guided them.The Poor Boy thanked his friends for their help and returned home just as the sun shone upon the hut. The old woman looked angrily at him but said nothing.But now trouble came. The year was over and the Poor Boy began to rack his brains because he did not know which horse in the drove he ought to choose. Thats the way with overhasty people. The Wood Witch could probably have told him this too if he had not left her so quickly. Now he went to work haphazard. Still he thought whatever he might hit upon he should not fare badly for on a long journey it was better at any rate to be on horseback than on foot. Besides he had seen the old witchs horses run and knew that they were fine animals no worthless jades. So he went through the drove and as he walked noticed a sick filly which he pitied because it looked so neglected but he did not think of choosing it. But no matter how much he turned and twisted he always stopped beside this animal for he was very kindhearted and told himself that even if he could not make much use of it he could at least do the poor creature some service.Who knows he said if I should comb brush and curry it perhaps it may yet make a good horseSo he chose it and resolved to take with him the pouch containing the comb brush and currycomb in order to carefully tend his horse.The old witch turned green with spite when she heard that the youth had chosen this steed for it was the very one. But what could she do She was obliged to keep her promise. She merely advised him to select another better animal telling him that he would soon be without a horse and that good work deserved good wages but at last she gave it to him.Still a witch always remains a witch and when the Poor Boy had mounted taken leave of her and ridden off she went to the big caldron took it off and mounted the tripod then she changed herself in face and figure and hurried after with the speed of curses to catch him kill him and get her horse back. The Poor Boy felt that something terrible was pursuing him and set spurs to his steed.Its no use to spur me said the horse we cant outrun her so long as we are on her lands. But throw the comb behind you to put an obstacle in her way.Now the Poor Boy knew that he had chosen wisely when he took the sick filly. So he drew the comb out of the bag flung it behind him and it instantly became a long high fence which the witch could not climb over so she was obliged to go a long way round and he thus gained a start.Throw down the brush said the horse when it again heard the trampling of the tripod near them.The rider threw the brush which turned into a dense growth of reeds through which the old hag forced her way with much difficulty and many a groan.Throw the currycomb cried the horse for the third time. When he had flung that down the Poor Boy looked back and saw a whole forest of knives and swords and among them the witch trying to get through and being cut into mincemeat.When they reached the seventh forest where the witchs kingdom ended the sick horse shook itself and became a handsome winged steed whose like was never seen before or since.Now hold fast said the horse I am going to carry you as never hero went from this world to the other for I too have a sister there whom I seek.The Poor Boy was dazed by the swiftness with which the horse flew over the forest and alighted in the other world through a large opening in another part of the woods. When he recovered his senses he found himself on the shore of the other world with the horse which now shook itself a second time changed into a handsome prince with long curling locks and saidWherever you go may good luck be your companion for you have released me from the spell the Wood Witch laid upon me. Learn that I am the son of the Red Emperor and set out to seek my sister but on the edge of the forest I met the Wood Witch who complained that she could walk no further and begged me to carry her on my back but when out of pity I let her get on my shoulders she changed me into a horse and condemned me to retain that form until a hero took pity on me and mounted me that I might carry him to the other world there I was to regain my human form.The Poor Boy was greatly overjoyed to find himself no longer alone. He took the bran loaf broke it in halves and gave one portion to the prince that they might be brothers till death. The prince tasted the bread and as he ate his strength and his love increased. They told each other their experiences and then went on their way.Far far off just at the end of the coastline rose shining buildings which must be the dragons palaces. The country here was so beautiful that one would have gladly traveled through it forever it was so radiant with light so green so rich in flowers birds of beautiful plumage and tame sportive animals. And in this country men never grew old but remained exactly the same age as when they entered it for here there were no days the sun neither rose nor set but the light came of itself as if from a clear sky. The dragons however were nowhere to be seen and the two brothers for life continued their way. After they had walked as far as a threedays march they reached the beautiful palaces and paused before them because they were so marvelously lovely with high towers and walls built of stones as soft as velvet covered with plates of snow that had been dried in the sun. But they seemed empty and deserted.The Poor Boy and the prince entered went through all the rooms filled with costly ornaments and seeing no one thought that the dragon must surely have gone hunting and determined to wait for him. But they were surprised that they did not find their sisters here. Each stretched himself on one of the beautiful divans and was going to rest when suddenly both started up amazed by what they heard.Dear me It was a song so touching that it would have softened the very stones it made those who listened feel as if they were in heaven and the notes were in a womans voice. The two companions did not listen long but hurried off in the direction from which the sound came.This is what they sawin one part of the palace was a glass tower and in this tower sat a girl spinning singing and weeping but her tears in falling were instantly changed to pearls. This maiden was so beautiful that if she had been in the world two men would have killed each other for her sake. When the heroes beheld her they stood motionless and gazed longingly at her but the girl stopped spinning and neither sang nor wept but looked at them in amazement.She was not the sister of either youth but as usually happens in such cases the Poor Boy supposed she was the princes sister and the prince thought she was the sister of the Poor Boy.Ill stay here said the Poor Boy and you can go on deliver my sister and marry her.No Ill stay here replied the prince you can go on and release my sister for this maiden shall be my wife.Now came trouble When they understood that the lovely girl was the sister of neither the handsome heroes seized their swords and were on the point of fighting as men do fight when they are obliged to divide any thing.Stop said the fair girl dont attack each other. It is better first to discover whether I am really what I seem to you or after all only a shadow I am the Bodiless Maiden who will not obtain form in this world until the dragon has stolen me from the other shore. I shall then be as you see me now shall spin sing and weep because I shall think of my mother who is spinning singing and weeping and your sisters who were stolen by the two older brothers of the dragon who rules this palace spin sing and weep too.On hearing this the two heroes wanted to set off at once in order to lose no more time on the way.Stop dont be over hasty said the Bodiless Maiden. You probably think that you will conquer the dragons by mere will Great deeds await you. The old shedragon put me here that I might constantly spur on her youngest son because it is written that all three brothers are to be married at the same time. The two older brothers keep your sisters prisoners but can not wed them till the youngest son has stolen me. Whenever he comes home from hunting he stops there where you are standing gazes longingly at me then arranges his weapons and feeds his horse with redhot coals but cant set out yet because my hour has not come. So stay and conquer him here that he may not steal me while you are on your way for you would then be too late in reaching your sisters. Yet mind one thing you can not conquer him outside of his courtyard because he is invisible. So when he comes home he throws his club at the gate with so much force that the earth quakes the walls fall down and any mortals who might be inside are buried alive. If you feel that you have strength enough to hold the gates on their hinges so that they can not give way when he hurls the club against them stay otherwise go in Gods name for it would be a pity to lose your young lives.The Poor Boy and the prince looked at each other understood that the deed must be done and resolved to stay. While the Poor Boy went to the gates to hold them the prince drew his sword and awaited the dragon in the middle of the courtyard. You can perceive that this was no joke.Very little time passed when suddenly crash the club struck against the ironbarred gates so that one might have believed the world was falling to pieces. The Poor Boy thought the muscles of his heart would crack in two under the terrible strain and the walls would crumble to their foundationsbut he held the gates on their hinges. When the dragon saw that the palace did not fall down he stood still in surprise.What does this mean he said. I must have grown very weak since yesterday. He did not suspect what awaited him.When with some difficulty he opened the gate he did not notice the Poor Boy but went straight toward the prince who stood in mortal terror in the middle of the courtyard for after all what would you expect A dragon is a dragon and not a girl in womans clothes.We wont linger over the story any longer we know what always happens when dragons and princes meet. They began the battle. The prince was a hero but the dragon was the youngest of three brothers They fought with swords who knows how long then when they saw that neither could conquer the other in that way they fought hand to hand while the Poor Boy held up the palace that it might not fall down on their heads.When the Poor Boy saw that his strength was failing and neither was conquering the other he called loudly Seize him and throw him on the ground I can hold out no longer.The prince grasped the dragon summoned up all his strength and hurled him on the ground so that his bones cracked and he lay senseless then he hastily took to flight ran through the halfopen gate and pulled the Poor Boy after him the walls fell the huge splendid palaces toppled down and as it were buried the dragon alive. Nothing remained standing except the glass tower now empty and deserted. The Bodiless Maiden had vanished from it the very moment that there was no longer any one who could have stolen her from the other world.The two comrades thanked the Lord that they had been able to accomplish their task so far and journeyed on walking and walking till they reached the palace of the second dragon. Already in the distance they saw the glass tower and heard the wailing song but the Poor Boys heart beat higher because the nearer he approached the more distinctly he recognized his sisters voice. When they reached the beautiful great palace and saw the girl in the glass tower both rushed up to break into the turret and clasp her in their arms.But affairs could not be managed so easily. The girl in the glass tower who was really the Poor Boys sister looked at them in surprise but when he told her that he had come to rescue her from the dragons claws she replied that she did not know him and that neither in face nor form did he bear any resemblance to her brother. Great was the Poor Boys grief when he saw that his sister wanted to have nothing to do with him though for her sake he had crossed so many moors and encountered so many dangers but his sorrow became still greater when she began to complain that she was dying of love for the dragon. Every day she said he came and gazed ardently at her yet day after day kept her a prisoner and did not marry her. Still this was endurable to the Poor Boy because she was only his sister but when the prince saw the girl heard her voice and perceived her love for the dragon he became perfectly frantic.Well then if you wont come well carry you off by force he said ready to take the whole palace on his back and fly with it to the other shore.Gently gently said the girl if it came to that I need only pull a nail out of this glass wall to bring the whole palace toppling down upon your heads. But I pity your youth and advise you not to stay here long because my betrothed husband might catch you and you will have no one to mourn for you.The Poor Boy now took his ashcake from his knapsack and said Sister just taste this bread and then say that I am not your brother.She held out her hand and the glass walls opened but after she had taken the bread and tasted it she felt that it had been mixed with her own mothers milk and was seized with such terrible homesickness that one might have wept for pity. Forward she said hastily let us fly for if he finds us here woe betide you.The Poor Boy took her in his arms and kissed her because she was his sister but the prince embraced and kissed her too becausebecause he was the Poor Boys sworn brother.Then they agreed to serve this dragon as they had served his brother so they waited awhile received the dragon as he deserved conquered him and after thanking God that they had overcome this peril too journeyed on again to deliver the emperors daughter.But now came fresh trouble. The princess did not want to be rescued and the prince had no token with him by which she might have recognized him as her brother. In vain the Poor Boy told her that if she did not come willingly he would carry her off by force she kept her hand on the dangerous nail and it was impossible to coax her.I must mention that it would go hard with them if they waited for the dragon for there were only two champions and if one held up the palace by keeping the gates on their hinges and the other waited for the dragon in the middle of the courtyard there was no one who could protect them from the nail.Let me attend to it said the Poor Boy who since he had seen the princess had grown fairly frantic. Either his life or mineAs we perceive he had determined to fight the dragon in the open ground where he could not see hima thing never heard of since fairy princes first began to fight the dragons brood for if it is hard to conquer a dragon at all it is doubly difficult to vanquish one when he is invisible and no one had ever thought of such an exploit.The prince and the Poor Boys sister hid themselves in a ditch near the palace that the dragon might not see them but the Poor Boy stationed himself a little behind the gate and waited for the dragon to hurl his club in order to get near him for when he no longer had a club he would be obliged to fight either with his sword or with his fists.Ere long crash the club struck the ironbarred gate but the Poor Boy was not slow he opened the other gate and ran out with it leaving the palace to fall in ruins behind him.Come on if you have the courage to show yourself he shouted believing that the dragon would make some reply and thus betray himself.But the dragon felt that he had found his match and did not think of speaking but invisible to the youth approached drew his sword and aimed straight at his enemys head to hack it off but the blow only broke the lads jaw. The wound hurt the Poor Boy but it pleased him too because he now knew where to look for his foe so he rushed in the direction from which the blow had come struck out and felt that he hit flesh struck again and again felt that he had hit and so continued to deal short swift thrusts with which he drove the dragon before the point of his sword. Suddenly he perceived that he no longer hit any thing and the dragon had escaped so he stood cowering like a person who does not know from whence the next blow will come.The dragon again aimed straight at the Poor Boys head and as he hacked struck off his right ear.Ill pay you for that shouted the youth rushing upon him again. But his strength was now greatly diminished and he only hit the dragon twice before he lost him from the point of his saber.The princess was watching their battle from her tower which had remained standing and as she watched wondered at the Poor Boys heroic courage but when she saw the dragon aiming a third blow at the youths head she called Dear hero turn to the right and spit three times then you can see your foe.When the Poor Boy heard this he felt a hundred thousand times stronger than he had been before and as he turned to the right spit and saw the dragon he rushed upon him seized him in his arms and squeezed him so that he crushed all his bones and flung him on the ground as dead as a mouse.The prince and the Poor Boy lost no time but prepared to journey home. The princess kissed the Poor Boy and his ear and his chin instantly healed so that he looked even handsomer than before. Then the two comrades went to the dragons stables which were hidden under the foundations of the fallen palace. Each took an enchanted horse mounted lifted his betrothed bride upon it and hurried homeward.If the Red Emperor had been only an ordinary mortal he would have rejoiced but he was a sovereign to boot He divided his empire between his son and his daughters husband the Poor Boy went to his poor mothers house to bring her to court and when she had arrived a wedding was celebrated dear me a wedding that will be talked about as long as the world stands.
Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her and the the peasant woman too was quite willing. One day therefore he said to the woman Listen my dear friend I have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together. Ill tell you what on Wednesday you must take to your bed and tell your husband you are ill and if you only complain and act being ill properly and go on doing so until Sunday when I have to preach I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has at home a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a sick mother a sick sister brother or whosoever else it may be and makes a pilgrimage to the Gckerli hill in Italy where you can get a peck of laurelleaves for a kreuzer the sick child the sick husband the sick wife the sick father or sick mother the sick sister or whosoever else it may be will be restored to health immediately.I will manage it said the woman directly. Now therefore on the Wednesday the peasant woman took to her bed and complained and lamented as agreed on and her husband did everything for her that he could think of but nothing did her any good and when Sunday came the woman said I feel as ill as if I were going to die at once but there is one thing I should like to do before my end  I should like to hear the parsons sermon that he is going to preach today. On that the peasant said Ah my child do not do it  thou mightest make thyself worse if thou wert to get up. Look I will go to the sermon and will attend to it very carefully and will tell thee everything the parson says.Well said the woman go then and pay great attention and repeat to me all that thou hearest. So the peasant went to the sermon and the parson began to preach and said if any one had at home a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a sick mother a sick sister brother or any one else and would make a pilgrimage to the Gckerli hill in Italy where a peck of laurelleaves costs a kreuzer the sick child sick husband sick wife sick father sick mother sick sister brother or whosoever else it might be would be restored to health instantly and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over and he would give him the sack for the laurelleaves and the kreuzer. Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant and after the service was over he went at once to the parson who gave him the bag for the laurelleaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home and even at the house door he cried Hurrah dear wife it is now almost the same thing as if thou wert well The parson has preached today that whosoever had at home a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a sick mother a sick sister brother or whoever it might be and would make a pilgrimage to the Gckerli hill in Italy where a peck of laurelleaves costs a kreuzer the sick child sick husband sick wife sick father sick mother sick sister brother or whosoever else it was would be cured immediately and now I have already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson and will at once begin my journey so that thou mayst get well the faster and thereupon he went away. He was however hardly gone before the woman got up and the parson was there directly.But now we will leave these two for a while and follow the peasant who walked on quickly without stopping in order to get the sooner to the Gckerli hill and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an eggmerchant and was just coming from the market where he had sold his eggs. May you be blessed said the gossip where are you off to so fastTo all eternity my friend said the peasant my wife is ill and I have been today to hear the parsons sermon and he preached that if any one had in his house a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a sick mother a sick sister brother or any one else and made a pilgrimage to the Gckerli hill in Italy where a peck of laurelleaves costs a kreuzer the sick child the sick husband the sick wife the sick father the sick mother the sick sister brother or whosoever else it was would be cured immediately and so I have got the bag for the laurelleaves and the kreuzer from the parson and now I am beginning my pilgrimage. But listen gossip said the eggmerchant to the peasant are you then stupid enough to believe such a thing as that Dont you know what it means The parson wants to spend a whole day alone with your wife in peace so he has given you this job to do to get you out of the way.My word said the peasant. How Id like to know if thats trueCome then said the gossip Ill tell you what to do. Get into my eggbasket and I will carry you home and then you will see for yourself. So that was settled and the gossip put the peasant into his eggbasket and carried him home.When they got to the house hurrah but all was going merrily there The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard and had made pancakes and the parson was there and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door and woman asked who was there. It is I gossip said the eggmerchant give me shelter this night I have not sold my eggs at the market so now I have to carry them home again and they are so heavy that I shall never be able to do it for it is dark already.Indeed my friend said the woman thou comest at a very inconvenient time for me but as thou art here it cant be helped come in and take a seat there on the bench by the stove. Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson however and the woman were as merry as possible. At length the parson said Listen my dear friend thou canst sing beautifully sing something to me. Oh said the woman I cannot sing now in my young days indeed I could sing well enough but thats all over now.Come said the parson once more do sing some little song.On that the woman began and sangIve sent my husband away from meTo the Gckerli hill in Italy.Thereupon the parson sangI wish twas a year before he came backId never ask him for the laurelleaf sack.Hallelujah.Then the gossip who was in the background began to sing but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand so the gossip sangWhat art thou doing my Hildebrand dearThere on the bench by the stove so nearHallelujah.And then the peasant sang from his basketAll singing I ever shall hate from this dayAnd here in this basket no longer Ill stay.Hallelujah.And he got out of the basket and cudgelled the parson out of the house.
Under the name of Eliza Wharton for a brief time lived a woman whose name was said to be Elizabeth Whitman. Little is known of her and it is thought that she had gone among strangers to conceal disgrace. She died without telling her story. In 1788 she arrived at the Bell Tavern Danvers in company with a man who after seeing her properly bestowed drove away and never returned. A graceful beautiful wellbred woman with face overcast by a tender melancholy she kept indoors with her books her sewing and a guitar avoiding the gossip of the idle. She said that her husband was absent on a journey and a letter addressed to Mrs. Eliza Wharton was to be seen on her table when she received callers. Once a stranger paused at her door and read the name thereon. As he passed on the woman groaned I am undone One good woman seeing her need of care and defiant of village prattling took her to her home and there after giving birth to a dead child she passed away. Among her effects were letters full of pathetic appeal and some verses closing thus O thou for whose dear sake I bearA doom so dreadful so severeMay happy fates thy footsteps guideAnd oer thy peaceful home preside.Nor let Elizas early tombInfect thee with its baleful gloom.A stone was raised above her grave by whom it is not known and this inscription was engraved thereon This humble stone in memory of Elizabeth Whitman is inscribed by her weeping friends to whom she endeared herself by uncommon tenderness and affection. Endowed with superior genius and acquirements she was still more endeared by humility and benevolence. Let candor throw a veil over her frailties for great was her charity for others. She sustained the last painful scene far from every friend and exhibited an example of calm resignation. Her departure was on the 25th of July 1788 in the thirtyseventh year of her age and the tears of strangers watered her grave.
Two Weeoombeen brothers went out hunting. One brother was much younger than the other and smaller so when they sighted an emu the elder one said to the younger You stay quietly here and do not make a noise or Piggiebillah whose camp we passed just now will hear you and steal the emu if I kill it. He is so strong. Ill go on and try to kill the emu with this stone. The little Weeoombeen watched his big brother sneak up to the emu crawling along almost flat on the ground. He saw him get quite close to the emu then spring up quickly and throw the stone with such an accurate aim as to kill the bird on the spot. The little brother was so rejoiced that he forgot his brothers caution and he called aloud in his joy. The big Weeoombeen looked round and gave him a warning sign but too late Piggiebillah had heard the cry and was hastening towards them. Quickly big Weeoombeen left the emu and joined his little brother.Piggiebillah when he came up said What have you foundNothing said the big Weeoombeen nothing but some mistletoe berries.It must have been something more than that or your little brother would not have called out so loudly.Little Weeoombeen was so afraid that Piggiebillah would find their emu and take it that he said I hit a little bird with a stone and I was glad I could throw so straight.It was no cry for the killing of a little bird or for the finding of mistletoe berries that I heard. It was for something much more than either or you would not have called out so joyfully. If you do not tell me at once I will kill you both.The Weeoombeen brothers were frightened for Piggiebillah was a great fighter and very strong so when they saw he was really angry they showed him the dead emu.Just what I want for my supper he said and so saying dragged it away to his own camp. The Weeoombeens followed him and even helped him to make a fire to cook the emu hoping by so doing to get a share given to them. But Piggiebillah would not give them any he said he must have it all for himself.Angry and disappointed the Weeoombeens marched straight off and told some black fellows who lived near that Piggiebillah had a fine fat emu just cooked for supper.Up jumped the black fellows seized their spears bade the Weeoombeens quickly lead them to Piggiebillahs camp promising them for so doing a share of the emu.When they were within range of spear shot the black fellows formed a circle took aim and threw their spears at Piggiebillah. As the spears fell thick on him sticking out all over him Piggiebillah cried aloud Bingehlah Bingeblah. You can have it you can have it. But the black fellows did not desist until Piggiebillah was too wounded even to cry out then they left him a mass of spears and turned to look for the emu. But to their surprise they found it not. Then for the first time they missed the Weeoombeens.Looking round they saw their tracks going to where the emu had evidently been then they saw that they had dragged the emu to their nyunnoo which was a humpy made of grass.When the Weeoombeens saw the black fellows coming they caught hold of the emu and dragged it to a big hole they knew of with a big stone at its entrance which stone only they knew the secret of moving. They moved the stone got the emu and themselves into the hole and the stone in place again before the black fellows reached the place.The black fellows tried to move the stone but could not. Yet they knew that the Weeoombeens must have done so for they had tracked them right up to it and they could hear the sound of their voices on the other side of it. They saw there was a crevice on either side of the stone between it and the ground. Through these crevices they drove in their spears thinking they must surely kill the brothers. But the Weeoombeens too had seen these crevices and had anticipated the spears so they had placed the dead emu before them to act as a shield. And into its body were driven the spears of the black fellows extended for the Weeoombeens.Having driven the spears well in the black fellows went off to get help to move the stone but when they had gone a little way they heard the Weeoombeens laughing. Back they came and speared again and again started for help only as they left to hear once more the laughter of the brothers.The Weeoombeens finding their laughter only brought back the black fellows to a fresh attack determined to keep quiet which after the next spearing they did.Quite sure when they heard their spear shots followed by neither conversation nor laughter that they had killed the Weeoombeens at last the black fellows hurried away to bring back the strength and cunning of the camp to remove the stone.The Weeoombeens hurriedly discussed what plan they had better adopt to elude the black fellows for well they knew that should they ever meet any of them again they would be killed without mercy. And as they talked they satisfied their hunger by eating some of the emu flesh.After a while the black fellows returned and soon was the stone removed from the entrance. Some of them crept into the hole where to their surprise they found only the remains of the emu and no trace of the Weeoombeens. As those who had gone in first crept out and told of the disappearance of the Weeoombeens others incredulous of such a story crept in to find it confirmed. They searched round for tracks seeing that their spears were all in the emu it seemed to them probable the Weeoombeens had escaped alive but if so whither they had gone their tracks would show. But search as they would no tracks could they find. All they could see were two little birds which sat on a bush near the hole watching the black fellows all the time. The little birds flew round the hole sometimes but never away always returning to their bush and seeming to be discussing the whole affair but what they said the black fellows could not understand. But as time went on and no sign was ever found of the Weeoombeens the black fellows became sure that the brothers had turned into the little whitethroated birds which had sat on the bush by the hole so they supposed to escape their vengeance. And ever afterwards the little whitethroats were called Weeoombeens. And the memory of Piggiebillah is perpetuated by a sort of porcupine anteater which bears his name and whose skin is covered closely with miniature spears sticking all over it.
This is how the Hoopoes came to know the great King Solomon. Once he was far out in the wilderness for there was no part of his kingdom that Solomon did not visit he had seen that the great store city was finished to his liking even Tadmor in the desert and across the sand the Kings cavalcade made its way with the camels and the dromedaries and their broidered saddlecloths bright as flowers and jewelled bridles flashing as brightly as the sun itself. But the heat smote down on the Kings head and Solomon yearned for shade. As if in answer to his longing who should appear but a flock of Hoopoes. Being curious by nature they circled round until they reached the Kings camel and kept just overhead so that they might watch this most famous of all monarchs and perchance overhear some word of wisdom. Thus the little birds cast a grateful shadow over the King for his whole journey and richly repaid they were for Solomon always polite to the humblest creature in his kingdom conversed freely with them during the whole time.When they reached his palace he thanked them for the service they had done him and asked what he could do in return. Now the Hoopoes had begun their conversation with Solomon modestly enough in fact they had been very surprised that he had spoken to them at all. But he had questioned them so kindly about their ways of living and their likes and preferences and relations that they lost their fear of him and they came to this wonderful palace and saw all the servants in their shining robes standing behind the Kings throne and waiting at his table and lining the great courtyard and when they beheld the walls of ivory inlaid with gold and the golden lions guarding the steps and the white peacocks on the silver terraces it quite turned their heads to think they had journeyed right across the desert with the owner of these riches.So instead of answering Solomon with thanks on their part and telling him his words of wisdom were rich reward for any shelter they had given the Hoopoes begged leave to consult together and withdrew to the palace roof where they discussed what they would ask for. Finally they decided they would like golden crowns such as the King himself wore then they could return to the other birds and reign over them. Thereupon the little birds flew down with a rush and made their request to the King as he walked in his wonderful garden. What the King has said the King has said Solomon replied.  The gift you desire shall be granted yet because you rendered me true service when you wish to get rid of your crowns you may return and exchange them for wisdom.Nay King said the Hoopoes.  Well we know that wisdom has brought you great renown but no one would bow down to you or give attention to your words unless you wore your golden crown. We shall be able to repeat your wise words profitably now for all will listen when they see gold crowns on our heads too.All the same return to me without fear or shame if your crowns do not satisfy said King Solomon kindly and ordered his goldsmiths to supply the Hoopoes with crowns of the finest gold procurable. Off flew the silly little birds therefore with the shining crowns upon their heads prouder than the peacocks and chattering more loudly than the parrots and macaws. They could scarcely wait to get back to their friends and hear their exclamations. But when the Hoopoes informed their friends they were now Kings of the Bird World their friends only laughed and said they were quite satisfied with Solomon and he was the only King they wished or needed. Then they drove the Hoopoes from the trees for their golden crowns were always catching in the branches and the other birds became tired of helping them out. But the Hoopoes decided the other birds were jealous and rather flattered gathered round the pools so that they could admire themselves in the water.Very soon people began to notice the queer antics of the silly little things as they strutted up and down cocking their heads first this side then that and finally a man caught one and discovered the wonderful golden crown it wore. He hurried off with it to a goldsmith who gave him so high a price for it that the man rushed back to the pool and laid snares for the Hoopoes who were so taken up with admiring themselves that they walked straight into them.Then came the saddest time for the Hoopoes. Every one began to hunt them. The poor little birds could not go to the wells and the pools for they were thick with nets they could not go into the gardens for fowlers lurked behind the flowers they could not fly up onto the housetops for even there the people had set traps for them. There did not seem a spot on the earth where they could rest and at last the wretched little birds flew back to the palace and waited till they beheld the great King Solomon coming along his terrace listening to his singers as they performed in the cool of the evening.Oh King said they  we have found that golden crowns are vanity we know not what you do to keep yourself from being chased about and hunted and so we have come to ask you to remove ours from us.Beloved Hoopoes said the King  a crown that people are expected to bow down to always sits heavy on the head and a crown that excites envy is a net for the feet. The only crown that can be worn with comfort is the crown of service and that crown should spring up naturally so that no one takes any particular notice of it.Give us that crown of service oh wise king said the poor little Hoopoes very humbly for they wanted nothing better now than to be taken no notice of.May it shelter you even as it sheltered me said the great King and on their heads the Hoopoes beheld crowns of feathers. But with these crowns came quite a new feeling to the Hoopoes they no longer wished to rule but to serve. Now the Arabian legend has it Solomon had a wonderful flying carpet where he sat on a golden throne with all his attendants round him. Mindful of the Hoopoes usefulness he summoned all the birds to make a flying canopy the Eagle was placed at their head but the Hoopoes were placed immediately over Solomon as he sat in the centre of his court. Thus shadowed Solomon and his friends and servants would rise from the ground and travel across the desert and over sea and land in cool and comfort.King Solomon and the Hoopoe. Illustration by Maxwell Armfield published in Wonder Tales of the World by Constance Armfield 1920 Harcourt Brace and Howe.One day however when they were right out in the wilderness and the sun was beating down with all its might a ray of sunlight flashed through and struck the Kings face. A hole had appeared in the canopy. Naturally word was passed to the Eagle who flew up at once to see what had happened and thus perceived one of the Hoopoes was absent from its place leaving a hole through which the sunbeam entered. The Eagle presented itself before Solomon therefore and told the amazing news and Solomon ordered the Eagle to hasten off at once and find the missing Hoopoe who must have soared up and above the heads of all the other birds to make its escape for no one had seen it go. Off went the Eagle rising up and up until it was lost to sight in the high skies. But though no one on earth could see the Eagle now his sight was very keen and presently he beheld a speck winging its way across the distant desert and swooping down met the missing Hoopoe.  Where have you been  cried the Eagle.Where black marble cuts the airIn great walls all shining bareStanding by the waterside There a great queen I espied.Golden tubs of orange treesStand against the walls but theseAre not half as bright as sheSitting in great majesty.She is called the Queen BalkisAnd her land a garden isLying over there so far Right across Arabia.The Hoopoe was so excited it broke into verse because it could not express its feelings any other way  but the Eagle was terribly angry. The Hoopoe did not seem to mind having deserted Solomon there it soared and circled making up poetry about a Queen as if it had done nothing wrong at all And in the meantime what do you think the great and wise King Solomon has been doing thundered the Eagle  whose noble head you are supposed to shieldAh spare me I beg said the little Hoopoe  for the sake of no other than our wise and noble King.Spare you for his sake said the Eagle very surprised. What mercy do you deserve And how can sparing you help our great King Nevertheless I say spare me for his sake repeated the Hoopoe  and take me back with you as quickly as you please for I have a most urgent message to deliver to no other than Solomon himself.The Eagle was so surprised at the Hoopoes boldness that he allowed it to accompany him back to the Flying Carpet and the Hoopoe flew onto the arm of Solomons throne. I found it far across the desert said the Eagle. But before the Eagle could say another word the Hoopoe broke in withOh great King beyond your landsA black marble palace stands With a wondrous queen therein Golden hair and golden skin. Golden oranges aglow Stand before her in a row Brighter than gold fruit she is And her name is Queen BalkisAnd how did you come to visit her said Solomon very sternly. Were you not on duty and know you not the penalty for those who fly from duty Mercy cried the Hoopoe  even as you some day must ask for mercy. Yes great King I have sinned and I know full well that I deserve dire punishment but let me tell you the wonders I have seen and give the message that has been given me ere you crush me with your hand.Why should I hearken to you said Solomon.Because no less than the King himself hath said he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise returned the Hoopoe.  Know that I had heard of the wonderful Queen of Sheba from a bird I met at Mecca and as we flew across Arabia I looked out and beheld the land of which so much had been told me. Nay had not I heard the Queen who lived there was richer than even the great King my master So I could not resist flying down from the canopy and having a look. Has not the great King said  The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul Aye and the way of a fool is right in his own eyes said Solomon sternly. Ah great King crush me not till I have given the message cried the Hoopoe until you have heard the whole of a story you cannot judge. Hearken to the story of my visit. Fertile and abundant in spices and gums is the land of Sheba but I could notice little for wonder at the marble palace all jet black which rose from the centre of the kingdom. Yet as I reached the palace I ceased to wonder thereat for seated on a throne of ebony was the most beautiful queen it is possible to imagine with golden hair rippling over the steps of the throne and fanned by dozens of servants into a whirling golden cloud. I asked why they were fanning her and they said because the Queens crown sat so heavy on her she could not bear the weight of her own hair. I flew in amongst the perfumed tresses fine as golden rain and thus I came close to her and heard her whispering to herself that she lacked wisdom and understanding and knew not how to govern her kingdom.  Mighty Queen Balkis said I  Hearken to the counsel of a little bird who is servant of the wisest King in the whole world. Well do I know that Solomon knows how to govern his kingdom wisely for I have worn a crown myself and know how difficult it is to rule. But Solomon relieved me of my crown of gold and gave me this which I wear in comfort. A crown that every one is expected to bow down to sits heavy on the head  the only crown that can be worn with ease is the crown of service. Oh wise words said the Queen happy bird to know the great King Solomon. Go to your master and ask if his wisdom has taught him kindness and if he would deign to advise a weak and sorrowful Queen who has scarcely the courage to cross the desert and present herself before the throne of one who has ruled hie kingdom so well.And now what is your answer oh Solomon Am I to return and tell her she may come and learn of your wisdom or will you crush a little bird in your hand whose only fault is that it is too curious a fault by the bye which led me to fly over your head the first time we met one another. Be assured said Solomon.  For that word spoken in season your sin shall be forgiven. Fly back to the Queen with this signet ring and tell her where a little bird does not fear to come a Queen may safely follow. If a Hoopoe can learn wisdom and put it to such profit shall not a QueenThen the Hoopoe joyfully rose up from the hand of Solomon and flew back to Queen Balkis  and when that wonderful procession safely reached Solomons palace and the great Queen Balkis and the long long train of camels laden with spices and precious stones and gold and ebony and ivory knelt before his throne the little Hoopoe circled in the air above their heads singing in its glad shrill voice these words that the King so often uttered A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear
The Sky had been lifted up and another great Island had come from the grip of Old One Tooth and was above the waters. The world was better now for men and women to live in. But still there were miseries in it and the greatest of these miseries was on account of the heedlessness of the Sun. For the Sun in those days made his way too quickly across the world. He hurried so that little of his heat got to the plants and the fruits and it took years and years for them to ripen. The farmers working on their patches would not have time in the light of a day to put down their crop into the ground so quickly the Sun would rush across the heavens and the fishermen would barely have time to launch their canoes and get to the fishing grounds when the darkness would come on. And the womens tasks were never finished. It was theirs to make the tapacloth a woman would begin at one end of the board to beat the bark with her foursided mallet and she would be only at the middle of the board by the time the sunset came. When she was ready to go on with the work next day the Sun would be already halfway across the heavens. Maui when he was a child used to watch his mother making tapa and as he grew up he pitied her more and more because of all the toil and trouble that she had. She would break the branches from the mamaka trees and from the wauke trees and soak them in water until their bark was easily taken off. Then she would take off the outer bark leaving the inner bark to be worked upon. She would take the bundles of the wet inner bark and lay them on the tapaboard and begin pounding them with little clubs. And then she would use her foursided mallet and beat all the soft stuff into little thin sheets. Then she would paste the little sheets together making large cloths. This was tapathe tapa that it was every womans business in those days to make. As soon as morning reddened the clouds Ma uis mother HinaoftheFire would begin her task she would begin beating the softened bark at one end of the board and she would be only in the middle of the board when the sunset came. And when she managed to get the tapa made she could never get it dried in a single day so quickly the Sun made his way across the heavens. Maui pitied his mother because of her unceasing toil. He greatly blamed the Sun for his inconsiderate ness of the people of the world. He took to watching the Sun. He began to know the path by which the Sun came over the great mountain Halea kala but in those days it was not called Halea kala the House of the Sun but Aheleakala The Rays of the Sun. Through a great chasm in the side of this mountain the Sun used to come. He told his mother that he was going to do some thing to make the Sun have more considerateness for the men and women of the world. You will not be able to make him do anything about it she said the Sun always went swiftly and he will always go swiftly. But Maui said that he would find a way to make the Sun remember that there were people in the world and that they were not at all pleased with the way he was going on. Then his mother said If you are going to force the Sun to go more slowly you must prepare your self for a great battle for the Sun is a great creature and he has much energy. Go to your grand mother who lives on the side of Haleakala said she but it was called Aheleakala then and beg her to give you her counsel and also to give you a weapon to battle with the Sun. So Maui went to his grandmother who lived on the side of the great mountain. Mauis grandmother was the one who cooked the bananas that the Sun ate as he came through the great chasm in the mountain. You must go to the place where there is a large wiliwili tree growing said his mother. There the Sun stops to eat the bananas that your grandmother cooks for him. Stay until the rooster that watches beside the wiliwili tree crows three times. Your grandmother will come out then with a bunch of bananas. When she lays them down do you take them up. She will bring another bunch out and do you take that up too. When all her bananas are gone she will search for the one who took them. Then do you show yourself to her. Tell her that you are Maui and that you belong to Hinaofthe Fire. So Maui went up the side of the mountain that is now called Heleakala but that then was called Aheleakala The Rays of the Sun. He came to where a great wiliwili tree was growing. There he waited. The rooster crew three times and then an old woman came out with a bunch of bananas. He knew that this was his grandmother. She laid the bananas down to cook them and as she did so Maui snatched them away. When she went to pick up the bunch she cried out Where are the bananas that I have to cook for my Lord the Sun She went within and got another bunch and this one too Maui snatched away. This he did until the last bunch of bananas that his grandmother had was taken. She was nearly blind so she could not find him with her eyes. She sniffed around and at last she got the smell of a man. Who are you she said. I am Maui and I belong to HinaoftheFire said he. What have you come for asked his grandmother. I have come to chastise the Sun and to make him go more slowly across the heavens. He goes so fast now that my mother cannot dry the tapa that she takes all the days of the year to beat out. The old woman considered all that Maui said to her. She knew that he was a hero born because the birds sang the pebbles rumbled the grass withered the smoke hung low the rainbow appeared the thunder was heard the hairless dogs were seen and even the ants in the grass were heard to sing in his praise. She decided to give help to him. And she told him what preparations he was to make for his battle with the Sun. First of all he was to get sixteen of the strongest ropes that ever were made. So as to be sure they were the strongest he was to knit them himself. And he was to make nooses for them out of the hair of the head of his sister HinaoftheSea. When the ropes were ready he was to come back to her and she would show him what else he had to do. Maui made the sixteen ropes he made them out of the strongest fibre and his sister Hinaofthe Sea gave him the hair of her head to make into nooses. Then with the ropes and the nooses upon them Maui went back to his grandmother. She told him where to set the nooses and she gave him a magic stone axe with which to do battle with the Sun. He set the nooses as snares for the Sun and he dug a hole beside the roots of the wiliwili tree and in that hole he hid himself. Soon the first ray of light the first leg of the Sun came over the mountain wall. It was caught in one of the nooses that Maui had set. One by one the legs of the Sun came over the rim and one by one they were caught in the nooses. One leg was left hanging down the side of the mountain it was hard for the Sun to move that leg. At last this last leg came slowly over the edge of the mountain and was caught in the snare. Then Maui gathered up the ropes and tied them to the great wiliwili tree. When the Sun saw that his sixteen legs were held fast by the nooses that Maui had set he tried to back down the mountainside and into the sea again But the ropes held him and the wiliwili tree stood the drag of the ropes. The Sun could not get away. Then he turned all his burning strength upon  fought. The man began to strike at the Sun with his magic axe of stone and never before did the Sun get such a beating. Give me my life said the Sun. I will give you your life said Maui if you promise to go slowly across the heavens. At last the Sun promised to do what Maui asked him. They entered into an agreement with each other Maui and the Sun. There should be longer days the Sun making his course slower. But every six months in the winter the Sun might go as fast as he had been in the habit of going. Then Maui let the Sun out of the snares which he had set for him. But lest he should ever forget the agreement he had made and take to travelling swiftly again Maui left all the ropes and the nooses on the side of Ha leakala so that he might see them every day that he came across the rim of the mountain. And the mountain was not called Aheleakala the Rays of the Sun any more but Haleakala the House of the Sun. After that came the saying of the people Long shall be the daily journey of the Sun and he shall give light for all the peoples toil. And Mauis mother HinaoftheFire learned that she could pound on the tapaboard until she was tired and the farmers could plant and take care of their crops and the fishermen could go out to the deep sea and fish and come back and the fruits and the plants got heat enough to make them ripen in their season. 
Two babies came one night in snowstorm weather came to a tar paper shack on a cinder patch next the railroad yards on the edge of the Village of LiverandOnions. The family doctor came that night came with a bird of a spizz car throwing a big spot light of a headlight through the snow of the snowstorm on the prairie. Twins said the doctor. Twins said e father and mother. And the wind as it shook the tar paper shack and shook the doors and the padlocks on the doors of the tar paper shack the wind seemed to be howling softly Twins twins. Six days and Christmas Eve came. The mother of the twins lit two candles two little twoforanickel candles in each little window. And the mother handed the father the twins and said Here are your Christmas presents. The father took the two baby boys and laughed Twice times twice is twice. The two little twoforanickel candles sputtered in each little window that Christmas Eve and at last sputtered and went out leaving the prairies dark and lonesome. The father and the mother of the twins sat by the window each one holding a baby. Every once in a while they changed babies so as to hold a different twin. And every time they changed they laughed at each other Twice times twice is twice.One baby was called Googler the other Gaggler. The two boys grew up and hair came on their bald red heads. Their ears wet behind got dry. They learned how to pull on their stockings and shoes and tie their shoe strings. They learned at last how to take a handkerchief and hold it open and blow their noses. Their father looked at them growing up and said I think youll make a couple of peanutwagon men pouring hot butter into popcorn sacks. The family doctor saw the rashes and the itches and the measles and the whooping cough come along one year and another. He saw the husky Googler and the husky Gaggler throw off the rashes and the itches and the measles and the whooping cough. And the family doctor said They will go far and see much and they will never be any good for sitting with the sitters and knitting with the knitters. Googler and Gaggler grew up and turned handsprings going to school in short pants whistling with school books under their arms. They went barefooted and got stickers in their hair and teased cats and killed snakes and climbed apple trees and threw clubs up walnut trees and chewed slippery ellum.They stubbed their toes and cut their feet on broken bottles and went swimming in brickyard ponds and came home with their backs sunburnt so the skin peeled off. And before they went to bed every night they stood on their heads and turned flipflops. One morning early in spring the young frogs were shooting silver spears of little new songs up into the sky. Strips of fresh young grass were beginning to flick the hills and spot the prairie with flicks and spots of new green. On that morning Googler and Gaggler went to school with fun and danger and dreams in their eyes. They came home that day and told their mother There is a war between the pen wipers and the pencil sharpeners. Millions of pen wipers and millions of pencil sharpeners are marching against each other marching and singing Hay foot strawfoot bellyful o bean soup. The pen wipers and the pencil sharpeners millions and millions are marching with drums drumming Ta rum ta rum ta rum turn turn. The pen wipers say No matter how many million ink spots it costs and no matter how many million pencil sharpeners we kill we are going to kill and kill till the last of the pencil sharpeners is killed. The pencil sharpeners say No matter how many million shavings it costs no matter how many million pen wipers we kill we are going to kill and kill till the last of the pen wipers is killed.The mother of Googler and Gaggler lis tened her hands folded her thumbs under her chin her eyes watching the fun and the danger and the dreams in the eyes of the two boys. And she said Me oh mybut those pen wipers and pencil sharpeners hate each other. And she turned her eyes toward the flicks and spots of new green grass coming on the hills and the prairie and she let her ears listen to the young frogs shooting silver spears of little songs up into the sky that day. And she told her two boys Pick up your feet now and run. Go to the grass go to the new green grass. Go to the young frogs and ask them why they are shooting songs up into the sky this early spring day. Pick up your feet now and run.At last Googler and Gaggler were big boys big enough to pick the stickers out of each others hair big enough to pick up their feet and run away from anybody who chased them. One night they turned flipflops and handsprings and climbed up on top of a peanut wagon where a man was pouring hot butter into popcorn sacks. They went to sleep on top of the wagon. Googler dreamed of teasing cats killing snakes climbing apple trees and stealing apples. Gaggler dreamed of swimming in brickyard ponds and coming home with his back sunburnt so the skin peeled off.They woke up with heavy gunnysacks in their arms. They climbed off the wagon and started home to their father and mother lugging the heavy gunnysacks on their backs. And they told their father and mother We ran away to the Thimble Country where the people wear thimble hats where the women wash dishes in thimble dishpans where the men go to work with thimble shovels. We saw a war the lefthanded people against the righthanded. And the smoke stacks did all the fighting. They all had monkey wrenches and they tried to wrench each other to pieces. And they had monkey aces on the monkey wrenchesto scare each other. All the time they were fighting the Thimble people sat looking on the thimble women with thimble dishpans the thimble men with thimble shovels. They waved handkerchiefs to each other some lefthand hand kerchiefs and some righthand handkerchiefs. They sat looking till the smokestacks with their monkey wrenches wrenched each other all to pieces. Then Googler and Gaggler opened the heavy gunnysacks. Here they said here is a lefthanded monkey wrench here is a righthanded monkey wrench. And here is a monkey wrench with a monkey face on the handleto scare with. Now the father and mother of Googler and Gaggler wonder how they will end up. The family doctor keeps on saying They will go far and see much but they will never sit with the sitters and knit with the knitters. And sometimes when their father looks at them he says what he said the Christmas Eve when the twoforanickel candles stood two by two in the windows Twice times twice is twice.
Floating in a basket on the River Nile Princess Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh King of Egypt found a tiny little waterbabe. Princess Bathia was a widow and had no children and she was so delighted that she took the child home to the palace and brought it up as her own. She called the babe Moses.He was a pretty little boy full of fun and frolic as he grew up and he became a favorite with everybody in the palace. Even the cruel King Pharaoh who had ordered that all the Hebrew boy babes should be drowned loved to play with him. His ministers of state and magicians however frowned when they saw Moses as soon as he could toddle and talk making a playmate of the king. They warned Pharaoh that it was dangerous to give a strange child such privileges but Princess Bathia only laughed at them. So did her mother the queen and King Pharaoh took no notice.When Moses was three years old Princess Bathia gave a birthday party in his honor. It was really a big banquet and was attended by the king and queen and all the courtiers. Moses was seated at the head of the table and his eyes opened very wide with wonderment at everything he saw. It seemed such a ridiculous lot of solemn fuss to him. He would rather have played on the floor or climbed on to the table but of course they would not allow him.What does all this mean he asked of the king who was seated next to him. Tell me and he playfully pulled King Pharaohs beard.The courtiers looked on horrified and Bilam the chief magician cried out Beware O king this is not play.Heed not these words my father said the princess. Bilam is ever warning thee. If thou wert to take notice of all that he says thou wouldst not have a moments peace. Take our little babe on thy knee and play with him.To please the princess King Pharaoh did so and Moses amused himself by playing with the glittering jewels on his majestys robes. Then he looked up and stared hard at the kings head.What is that he asked pointing.That is the royal crown answered Pharaoh.No it is not it is only a funny hat replied Moses.Beware chimed in Bilam solemnly.Let me put the hat on said Moses reaching up his little hands and before they could stop him he had taken the crown from the kings head and had put it on his own.Princess Bathia and the queen laughed merrily but Bilam looked very grave.Your majesty he said in a voice trembling with passion this is not the foolish play of a babe. This child remember is not as other children. Came he not from the river There is meaning in his action. Already does he seeks to rob you of your royal crown. Tis a portent of evil.Pharaoh thoughtfully stroked his beard.What say you Reuel he asked turning to his second chief magician.I say the child is but a babe and that this action means nothing answered Reuel.The queen and the princess agreed with Reuel who was their favorite but Bilam would not allow the matter to pass lightly.I Bilam am chief of your counselors he said and deeply learned in the mysteries of signs and portents. There is a meaning in all things. Remember O King this child is of the Hebrews and escaped your decree. This play of his has a meaning. Should he be permitted to grow up he will rebel against you and seek to destroy your rule. Let him be judged O king.Thy words are wise said Pharaoh who was himself annoyed with Moses and he ordered three judges to try the child for his offence.Moses thought it was a new game and he clapped his hands gleefully when they took him to the court of justice and stood him in front of the judges. He heard Reuel plead on his behalf but he did not understand it.I say he is but a babe and does things without meaning Reuel exclaimed. Put him to the test and see if he knows the difference between fire and gold. Place before him a dish of fire and a dish of jewels and gold. If he grasps the jewels it will prove that he is no ordinary child if he places his hand to the fire then shall we be assured he is merely a foolish babe.So be it said Bilam and if he grasps the jewels let his punishment be instant death.Pharaoh and the judges agreed and two dishes one containing burning coals and the other gold and precious stones were brought in and placed before Moses. Everybody looked on keenly as Moses stared at the dishes. Princess Bathia made signs to him but Bilam ordered her to cease and it was Reuel who comforted her and dried her tears.Take my magic staff he said handing to her a stick that seemed to be made of one large precious stone. This was given to Adam when he left the Garden of Eden and has been handed down to me through Enoch and Noah through Abraham and Jacob unto Joseph who left it in my keeping. Take the staff and Moses will obey whatsoever be thy wish.The princess took the staff and pressed it to her lips.I wish she said that my little waterbabe shall seize the burning coals.Moses thrust his fingers into the fire and pulled out a glowing coal. With a cry he put his fingers in his mouth to ease the pain and burned his tongue with the coal. Ever afterward he lisped.The princess snatched Moses and pressed him tightly to her bosom.Give me the magic stick she said to Reuel so that I may guard and protect the child.Can you read this word asked Reuel pointing to a word engraved on the staff.No said the princess.Then it cannot be yours answered Reuel. Whosoever reads this name can understand all things even the thoughts of animals and birds. Fear not for Moses. In years to come this staff shall be his.And so it came to pass. Years afterward when Moses was a man and fled from Egypt he married a daughter of Reuel who became a Hebrew and took the name of Jethro. Reuel planted the staff in his garden and Moses saw it. He read the magic word and touching the staff it came out of the ground into his hands. With this staff Moses performed the wonderful things in Egypt when he delivered the children of Israel from bondage as is related in the Bible.
There was once a Padishah who had forty sons and they spent the whole day in the forest hunting and snaring birds. When the youngest had completed his fourteenth year their father thought it was time they were getting married so he called them together and spoke to them about the matter We are willing to marry said the forty brothers but only if we can meet with forty sisters all having the same father and mother. The Padishah therefore sought throughout his dominions for such a family but in vain the greatest number of sisters in all the land was thirtynine. The fortieth will have to take another said the Padishah to his sons. But they refused to agree to that and begged their father to allow them to travel in foreign countries to seek the desired brides. What was the Padishah to do As he could not dissuade them he grudgingly granted their request. Before they set out however the Padishah said to them There are three things which you must bear well in mind. When you reach a large spring do not spend the night anywhere near it. Farther on is a hn do not spend the night there either. Beyond the hn is a great plain do not linger there a moment. The sons promising to remember their fathers advice mounted their steeds and rode away.Smoking and talking they wended their forward course and as evening drew on they came to the spring.Now we take not a single step farther observed the eldest. We are fatigued and it is night. Besides what have forty men to fearSo they alighted ate their supper and lay down to rest. The youngest the fourteenyearold brother kept watch however. Towards midnight he heard a rustling sound. Cautiously he drew his weapon and as the sound came nearer he saw a sevenheaded dragon. Both beast and youth rushed to attack one another. Three times the dragon wrestled with the youth but could obtain no advantage over him.Now it is my turn cried the Prince and with these words he struck the dragon such a powerful blow that six heads fell from his body.Strike once more gasped the dragon. Not I returned the youth. The dragon sank to the earth and behold one of his heads began to roll and it rolled and rolled till it reached a well. Let him who has taken my life take also my treasure said the head as it fell down the well.The youth now took a rope bound one end to a rock and with it let himself down the well. At the bottom he found an iron gate. Opening it and entering he saw a palace even more beautiful than that of his father. In the palace were forty apartments and in each apartment sat a maiden at an embroidery table near which immense treasures were piled up.Are you a man or a jin asked the terrorstricken maidens. I am a human being answered the Prince. I killed the sevenheaded dragon and came to this place by following one of his rolling heads. Now the forty maidens rejoiced. They all embraced him and begged him to remain with them. Incidentally they informed him that they were forty sisters whom the dragon had stolen. He had killed their parents and now they had not a single friend or relation in the wide world.We are forty brothers said the Prince and seek forty maidens. Then he told them he must ascend to his brothers but that soon he would come again to fetch them away. He came up from the well and went to the spring where he lay down and fell asleep.Early next morning when the forty brothers awoke they began to laugh at their fathers attempt to frighten them about the spring. They set off again and continued their way until evening when behold the hn their father had mentioned stood before them. We go no farther tonight  said the elder Princes. The youngest however expressed the opinion that it might be well to follow their fathers advice but the others would not listen to him. They ate their supper said their prayers and lay down but the youngest kept watch as before.Towards midnight he again heard a noise. With his drawn sword in hand the young Prince found himself confronting another sevenheaded dragon larger and more frightful than the one he had slain the day before. The dragon straightway attacked the youth but without effect then the youth fell on the dragon so furiously that six of his seven heads fell. The monster begged for another blow as a coup de grce but the Prince declined. As on the previous occasion one of the heads rolled into a well. The youth followed it and discovered a larger palace and greater treasures. Noting the place he returned to his brothers lay down and fell asleep so soundly after the fatigues of his combat that his brothers had to rouse him next morning.Mounting their horses again they pursued their journey up hill and down dale until by sunset they had reached a great plain. They ate and drank and were just going to lie down when suddenly an awful shriek was heard and the mountains seemed to quake. Terror seized every one as they caught sight of a gigantic sevenheaded dragon spitting fire and roaring Who has killed my two brothers Bring him to me that I may slay himThe youngest saw plainly that all his brothers were paralysed with fear and unable to do anything. He delivered to them the keys of both wells telling them to take home the forty maidens and the treasure. He promised that when he had killed the dragon he would follow them. The thirtynine sprang on their horses and rode away.Now we will return to the youngest.The conflict between the Prince and the dragon was a stern one and they fought a long time without either overcoming the other. When the dragon realized that the struggle was in vain he said to the Prince If you will go to the land of Chinimatchin and bring me the Padishahs daughter I will spare your life. The Prince consented to the condition for he was too exhausted to continue the combat any longer.Champalakas the dragon was calledgave the Prince a bridle and instructed him as follows Every day a magic horse Ajgyr grazes here Catch him put this bridle on him and command him to take you to the land of Chinimatchin.The goldenhued steed came flying through the air. Illustration by Willy Pogany published in Fortyfour Turkish Fairy Tales by Dr. Igncz Kenos 193 George C. Harrap and Co.So the youth took the bridle and waited for the magic horse. The goldenhued steed came flying through the air and no sooner was the bridle laid upon him than he said Command me little Sultan Shut your eyesopen your eyes and behold there was the youngest Prince in the faroff land of Chinimatchin He alighted from the horse took off the bridle and walked into the city.Entering an old womans hut he asked whether she could find him lodgings. Willingly answered the old woman. She offered him a seat and prepared some coffee. While he was drinking he made inquiries as to the condition of the country.A sevenheaded dragon said the old woman has fallen violently in love with our Sultans daughter. For years there has been war on her account and we cannot get rid of the monster. And the Sultans daughter questioned the Prince. She inhabits a kiosk in the Padishahs garden answered the old woman and away from it she dares not stir a step.Next day the Prince went to the Padishahs garden and asked the gardener to take him into his service. He begged so earnestly that at length the man took pity upon him. you have no other duty but to water the flowers said the gardener. The Sultans daughter saw the young man and she called him to the window asking him how he came to be in that land. The young man told her that his father was a Padishah and then he described his fight with Champalak and how he had promised to bring him the Sultans daughter. But fear not continued the Prince my love is much greater than that of the dragon and if you will come with me I know how to destroy him.The maiden had herself fallen in love with the handsome Prince and moreover wished to escape from her constant imprisonment. Her trust in the Prince was so great that one night they left the kiosk together in secret and repaired to Champalaks plain. On the way they discussed what the maiden might do to discover the dragons talisman for through that talisman the Prince meant to destroy the monster.We may imagine Champalaks joy when he saw the Sultans daughter before him. What happiness that you have come What happiness that you have come he repeated again and again as he caressed the Princess who was weeping all the time. Days and weeks elapsed but the Princess never dried her tears. If you would at least tell me what your talisman is she said one day to the dragon perhaps my days would not be quite so wearisome. My darling replied the dragon it is guarded in a place impossible of access. In a certain country there is a large palace and whoever gets into it never gets out again. This was all the Prince needed to know. He took his bridle threw it in the sea and the goldenhued steed appeared.What is your command little SultanTo the palace of the dragons talismanShut your eyesopen your eyes and there he was at the palace. As the Prince dismounted the magic horse said to himFasten my bridle to the iron rings at the palace gate. When I neigh once knock the rings together and the gate will open. The gate is a lions jaw and if you can cut it asunder with a single blow of your sword you are safe. Otherwise your last hour has come.Accordingly the Prince fastened the magic horse to the rings and when it neighed the gate opened. The Prince struck the gaping jaws of the lion a stout blow and split the creature asunder. This done he cut open its stomach and took therefrom a cage containing three doves so beautiful that their equals had never been seen before. Taking one in his hand he stroked its plumage caressed it and prrr it suddenly flew away. If the magic horse had not quickly flown after it caught it and wrung its neck the Prince would never have met his ladylove again.Now he remounted his magic horse. Shut your eyesopen your eyes and he found himself once more at Champalaks palace. At the gate the youth killed the other two doves and as he went in the dragon fell an inert mass to the floor. Seeing the dead doves in the Princes hand he implored him to let him stroke them once more before he died. The youth seized with pity was about to offer the birds to the dragon when the Sultans daughter ran in and tore them away. Upon this the dragon perished miserably. Fortunate it was for you said the magic horse that you did not give him the birds new life for him was in their touch. As there was no further use for it the bridle now disappeared and with it the magic horse.The Prince and the Sultans daughter gathered together all the Dragons treasures and bore them to the land of Chinimatchin.The Padishah had become quite ill through worrying about the disappearance of his daughter. Search had been made for her throughout the length and breadth of his dominions but as she could not be found the Padishah had come to the conclusion that she had fallen into the power of the dragon. When the Princess appeared again safe and sound he gladly gave her in marriage to the Prince and the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicings. After the honeymoon they set out with a brilliant retinue of soldiers for the palace of the Princes father. The Prince was thought to have died long ago and his claim to be indeed the Prince would hardly have been accepted had he not related the story of the three dragons and the forty sisters. His thirtynine brothers married thirtynine of the sisters the fortieth becoming the wife of the Princess of Chinimatchins brother and henceforth they all lived in the greatest happiness.
A long time ago in the days of King Adam of Calabar the king wanted to know if there was any animal or bird which was capable of enduring hunger for a long period. When he found one the king said he would make him a chief of his tribe.The Nsasak bird is very small having a shining breast of green and red he also has blue and yellow feathers and red round the neck and his chief food consists of ripe palm nuts. The Odudu bird on the other hand is much larger about the size of a magpie with plenty of feathers but a very thin body he has a long tail and his colouring is black and brown with a creamcoloured breast. He lives chiefly on grasshoppers and is also very fond of crickets which make a noise at night.Both the Nsasak bird and the Odudu were great friends and used to live together. They both made up their minds that they would go before the king and try to be made chiefs but the Odudu bird was quite confident that he would win as he was so much bigger than the Nsasak bird. He therefore offered to starve for seven days.The king then told them both to build houses which he would inspect and then he would have them fastened up and the one who could remain the longest without eating would be made the chief.They both then built their houses but the Nsasak bird who was very cunning thought that he could not possibly live for seven days without eating anything. He therefore made a tiny hole in the wall being very small himself which he covered up so that the king would not notice it on his inspection. The king then came and looked carefully over both houses but failed to detect the little hole in the Nsasak birds house as it had been hidden so carefully. He therefore declared that both houses were safe and then ordered the two birds to go inside their respective houses and the doors were carefully fastened on the outside.Every morning at dawn the Nsasak bird used to escape through the small opening he had left high up in the wall and fly away a long distance and enjoy himself all day taking care however that none of the people on the farms should see him. Then when the sun went down he would fly back to his little house and creep through the hole in the wall closing it carefully after him. When he was safely inside he would call out to his friend the Odudu and ask him if he felt hungry and told him that he must bear it well if he wanted to win as he the Nsasak bird was very fit and could go on for a long time.For several days this went on the voice of the Odudu bird growing weaker and weaker every night until at last he could no longer reply. Then the little bird knew that his friend must be dead. He was very sorry but could not report the matter as he was supposed to be confined inside his house.When the seven days had expired the king came and had both the doors of the houses opened. The Nsasak bird at once flew out and perching on a branch of a tree which grew near sang most merrily but the Odudu bird was found to be quite dead and there was very little left of him as the ants had eaten most of his body leaving only the feathers and bones on the floor.The king therefore at once appointed the Nsasak bird to be the head chief of all the small birds and in the Ibibio country even to the present time the small boys who have bows and arrows are presented with a prize which sometimes takes the shape of a female goat if they manage to shoot a Nsasak bird as the Nsasak bird is the king of the small birds and most difficult to shoot on account of his wiliness and his small size.
One day Loke was wandering about idly as he often did. He came near Thors house which had five hundred and forty rooms.By the window sat Sif Thors wife asleep. Loke thought it would be a good joke to cut off her beautiful hair and make Thor angry. So he crept in softly and cut off her hair close to her head without wakening her.When Thor came home and found out what had been done he knew at once who had done itRushing out he overtook Loke and threatened to crush him to atoms. To save his life Loke swore to get the elves to make hair of gold for Sif that would grow like real hair.Loke knew he had better do as he had promised so he went deep down into the earth to Alfheim. When he came near he looked through a crevice in the ground and there were the elves at work. He could see them by the. light of the forge fires.Some were running about with aprons on and with sooty faces. Some were hammering iron and others were smelting gold. Some were cutting out rock crystals and staining them red for garnets and rubies. The elf women brought violets and the greenest grass to be found on the earth above. With these they stained crystals blue and green for sapphires and emeralds.Some of the elf women brought childrens tears from the upper earth and the gentlest elves changed them into pearls.As fast as they were finished the jewels were carried away by the little elf boys and hidden in the ground where they are found to this day. If you wish to see what cunning workmen the elves were look at the shining faces and straight edges of quartz crystals or at the beautiful coloring of emeralds and rubies.The little elf girls crept through the earth under the ocean and gave the pearls to the oysters to keep. Even now the oysters shut their shells tight and will not give up the pearls.Loke watched the little workmen a long time. Then he went in and told his errand. Nothing delighted the elves so much as to have work to do. They promised Loke the golden hair and at once began to make it.A little elf ran in with a handful of gold and an old grandmother spun it into hair. As she spun she sang a magic song to give life to the gold. At the same time the elf blacksmiths and goldsmiths set about making a present for Loke.The blacksmiths made a spear that would never miss its mark. The goldsmiths made a ship that would sail without wind. Besides it could be folded up and put into the owners pocket.Loke appeared before the gods with these wonderful things. To Odin he gave the spear and to Frey the ship. Thor took the golden hair and put it upon Sifs head. Immediately it began to grow. At this the gods pardoned Loke.When Loke went out he began to boast that the sons of Ivakl who had made the gifts were the best workmen in the world.Brok an elf of another family heard him and exclaimed angrily Sindre my brother is the best blacksmith in the whole worldLoke dared Brok to show him three gifts of Sindres making equal to the spear the ship and the hair.Brok hastened to Sindre and told him. The two brothers began the work at once. Sindre put a pigskin into the furnace and told Brok to blow the fire with the bellows while he went out. Brok worked with a will. Loke had followed him and now changed himself into a fly and stung Broks ear. But Brok worked steadily never stopping to brush it off.Sindre came back and took out the pigskin and it had become a golden pig. So bright was it that it made the cave as light as day.Then Sindre put a little piece of gold into the furnace and went out again. Again as Brok worked at the bellows the fly came and stung him on the nose. But the elf did not stop for an instant.When Sindre took out the gold it had become a magic golden ring. Prom it every ninth night dropped eight golden rings.This time Sindre brought a piece of iron and put it into the furnace. Brok began his work. But Loke changed himself into a hornet and stung the elf on the forehead until the blood ran into his eyes.Brok bore it a long time. Then he paused a moment to drive away the hornet. Just then his brother came in and said it was of no use to go on after he had once stopped.Sindre took out the iron and it had become the mighty hammer Mjolner. But the handle was a little too short. This was because the elf had stopped when the hornet stung him.Brok took the golden pig the ring and the hammer to Asgard and presented them to the gods. Thor had just lost his hammer in a great fight with the Midgard Serpent so Mjolner was given to himThis hammer could never be lost because it would always return to the owner.The pig Golden Bristle was given to the sungod Frey because he had to take long journeys in dark places.Odin kept the golden ring himself.The gods voted Sindre a better blacksmith than the sons of Ivald. Brok demanded Lokes head which had been wagered. The cunning Loke said he might have the head but he must not touch the neck. So the elf did not get the head.
Once upon a time there was a peasant who led his cow to pasture in the spring and prayed God to have her in His care.The evil one was sitting in a bush heard him and said to himself When things turn out well they thank God for it but if anything goes wrong then I am always to blameA few days later the cow strayed into a swamp. And when the peasant came and saw her he said Look at that The devil has had his finger in the pie againJust what I might have expected thought the devil in his bush. Then the peasant went off to fetch people to help drag the cow out. But in the meantime the devil slipped from his bush and helped out the cow for he thoughtNow he will have something to thank me for too.But when the peasant came back and saw the cow on dry land he said Thank God shes out again
Alfred the sculptoryou know him We all know him he won the great gold medal and got a travelling scholarship went to Italy and then came back to his native land. He was young in those days and indeed he is young yet though he is ten years older than he was then.After his return he visited one of the little provincial towns on the island of Seeland. The whole town knew who the stranger was and one of the richest persons gave a party in honour of him and all who were of any consequence or possessed any property were invited. It was quite an event and all the town knew of it without its being announced by beat of drum. Apprentice boys and children of poor people and even some of the poor people themselves stood in front of the house and looked at the lighted curtain and the watchman could fancy that he was giving a party so many people were in the streets. There was quite an air of festivity about and in the house was festivity also for Mr. Alfred the sculptor was there.He talked and told anecdotes and all listened to him with pleasure and a certain kind of awe but none felt such respect for him as did the elderly widow of an official she seemed so far as Mr. Alfred was concerned like a fresh piece of blotting paper that absorbed all that was spoken and asked for more. She was very appreciative and incredibly ignoranta kind of female Caspar Hauser.I should like to see Rome she said. It must be a lovely city with all the strangers who are continually arriving there. Now do give us a description of Rome. How does the city look when you come in by the gateI cannot very well describe it replied the sculptor. A great open place and in the midst of it an obelisk which is a thousand years old.An organist exclaimed the lady who had never met with the word obelisk. A few of the guests could hardly keep from laughing nor could the sculptor quite keep his countenance but the smile that rose to his lips faded away for he saw close by the inquisitive dame a pair of dark blue eyesthey belonged to the daughter of the speaker and any one who has such a daughter cannot be silly The mother was like a fountain of questions and the daughter who listened but never spoke might pass for the beautiful Naiad of the fountain. How charming she was She was a study for the sculptor to contemplate but not to converse with and indeed she did not speak or only very seldom.Has the Pope a large family asked the lady.And the young man considerately answered as if the question had been better put No he does not come of a great family.Thats not what I mean the widow persisted. I mean has he a wife and childrenThe Pope is not allowed to marry said the gentleman.I dont like that was the ladys comment.She certainly might have put more sensible questions but if she had not spoken in just the manner she used would her daughter have leant so gracefully on her shoulder looking straight out with the almost mournful smile upon her faceThen Mr. Alfred spoke again and told of the glory of colour in Italy of the purple hills the blue Mediterranean the azure sky of the South whose brightness and glory was only surpassed in the North by a maidens deep blue eyes. And this he said with a peculiar application but she who should have understood his meaning looked as if she were quite unconscious of it and that again was charmingItaly sighed a few of the guests. Oh to travel sighed others. Charming charming chorused they all.Yes if I win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery said the head taxcollectors lady then we will travel. I and my daughter and you Mr. Alfred you must be our guide. Well all three travel together and one or two good friends more. And she nodded in such a friendly way at the company that each one might imagine he or she was the person who was to be taken to Italy. Yes we will go to Italy but not to those parts where there are robberswell keep to Rome and to the great high roads where one is safe.And the daughter sighed very quietly. And how much may lie in one little sigh or be placed in it The young man placed a great deal in it. The two blue eyes lit up that evening in honour of him must conceal treasurestreasures of the heart and mindricher than all the glories of Rome and when he left the party that night he had lost his heartlost it completely to the young lady.The house of the head taxcollectors widow was the one which Mr. Alfred the sculptor most assiduously frequented and it was understood that his visits were not intended for that lady though he and she were the people who kept up the conversation he came for the daughters sake. They called her Kala. Her name was really Calen Malena and these two names had been contracted into the one name Kala. She was beautiful but a few said she was rather dull and probably slept late of a morning.She has been always accustomed to that her mother said. Shes a beauty and they always are easily tired. She sleeps rather late but that makes her eyes so clear.What a power lay in the depths of these dark blue eyes Still waters run deep. The young man felt the truth of this proverb and his heart had sunk into the depths. He spoke and told his adventures and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questioning as on the first evening of their meeting.It was a pleasure to hear Alfred describe anything. He spoke of Naples of excursions to Mount Vesuvius and showed coloured prints of several of the eruptions. And the head taxcollectors widow had never heard of them before or taken time to consider the question.Good heavens she exclaimed. So that is a burning mountain But is it not dangerous to the people round aboutWhole cities have been destroyed he answered for instance Pompeii and Herculaneum.But the poor peopleAnd you saw all that with your own eyesNo I did not see any of the eruptions represented in these pictures but I will show you a picture of my own of an eruption I saw.He laid a pencil sketch upon the table and mamma who had been absorbed in the contemplation of the highly coloured prints threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishmentDid you see it throw up white fireFor a moment Alfreds respect for Kalas mamma suffered a sudden diminution but dazzled by the light that illumined Kala he soon found it quite natural that the old lady should have no eye for colour. After all it was of no consequence for Kalas mamma had the best of all thingsnamely Kala herself.And Alfred and Kala were betrothed which was natural enough and the betrothal was announced in the little newspaper of the town. Mamma purchased thirty copies of the paper that she might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances. And the betrothed pair were happy and the motherinlaw elect was happy too for it seemed like connecting herself with Thorwaldsen.For you are a continuation of Thorwaldsen she said to Alfred. And it seemed to Alfred that mamma had in this instance said a clever thing. Kala said nothing but her eyes shone her lips smiled her every movement was graceful yes she was beautiful that cannot be too often repeated.Alfred undertook to take a bust of Kala and of his motherinlaw. They sat to him accordingly and saw how he moulded and smoothed the soft clay with his fingers.I suppose its only on our account said mammainlaw that you undertake this commonplace work and dont leave your servant to do all that sticking together.It is highly necessary that I should mould the clay myself he replied.Ah yes you are so very polite retorted mamma and Kala silently pressed his hand still soiled by the clay.And he unfolded to both of them the loveliness of nature in creation pointing out how the living stood higher in the scale than the dead creature how the plant was developed beyond the mineral the animal beyond the plant and man beyond the animal. He strove to show them how mind and beauty become manifest in outward form and how it was the sculptors task to seize that beauty and to manifest it in his works.Kala stood silent and nodded approbation of the expressed thought while mammainlaw made the following confessionIts difficult to follow all that. But I manage to hobble after you with my thoughts though they whirl round and round but I contrive to hold them fast.And Kalas beauty held Alfred fast filled his soul and seized and mastered him. Beauty gleamed forth from Kalas every featuregleamed from her eyes lurked in the corners of her mouth and in every movement of her fingers. Alfred the sculptor saw this he spoke only of her thought only of her and the two became one and thus it may be said that she spoke much for he and she were one and he was always talking of her.Such was the betrothal and now came the wedding with bridesmaids and wedding presents all duly mentioned in the wedding speech.Mammainlaw had set up Thorwaldsens bust at the end of the table attired in a dressinggown for he was to be a guest such was her whim. Songs were sung and cheers were given for it was a gay wedding and they were a handsome pair. Pygmalion received his Galatea so one of the songs said.Ah thats your mythologies said mammainlaw.Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen where they were to live. Mammainlaw accompanied them to take care of the commonplace as she said meaning the domestic economy. Kala was like a doll in a dolls house all was so bright so new and so fine. There they sat all three and as for Alfred to use a proverb that will describe his position we may say that he sat like the friar in the gooseyard.The magic of form had enchanted him. He had looked at the case and cared not to inquire what the case contained and that omission brings unhappiness much unhappiness into married life for the case may be broken and the gilt may come off and then the purchaser may repent his bargain. In a large party it is very disagreeable to observe that ones buttons are giving way and that there are no buckles to fall back upon but it is worse still in a great company to become aware that wife and motherinlaw are talking nonsense and that one cannot depend upon oneself for a happy piece of wit to carry off the stupidity of the thing.The young married pair often sat hand in hand he speaking and she letting fall a word here and therethe same melody the same clear belllike sounds. It was a mental relief when Sophy one of her friends came to pay a visit.Sophy was not pretty. She was certainly free from bodily deformity though Kala always asserted she was a little crooked but no eye save a friends would have remarked it. She was a very sensible girl and it never occurred to her that she might become at all dangerous here. Her appearance was like a pleasant breath of air in the dolls house and air was certainly required here as they all acknowledged. They felt they wanted airing and consequently they came out into the air and mammainlaw and the young couple travelled to Italy.Thank Heaven that we are in our own four walls again was the exclamation of mother and daughter when they came home a year after.Theres no pleasure in travelling said mammainlaw. To tell the truth its very wearisomeI beg pardon for saying so. I found the time hang heavy though I had my children with me and its expensive work travelling very expensive And all those galleries one has to see and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after You must do it for decencys sake for youre sure to be asked when you come back and then youre sure to be told that youve omitted to see what was best worth seeing. I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas one seemed to be turning a Madonna oneselfAnd what bad living you get said Kala.Yes replied mamma no such thing as an honest meat soup. Its miserable trash their cookery.And the travelling fatigued Kala she was always fatigued that was the worst of it. Sophy was taken into the house where her presence was a real advantage.Mammainlaw acknowledged that Sophy understood both housewifery and art though a knowledge of the latter could not be expected from a person of her limited means and she was moreover an honest faithful girl she showed that thoroughly while Kala lay sickfading away.Where the case is everything the case should be strong or else all is over. And all was over with the caseKala died.She was beautiful said mamma she was quite different from the antiques for they are so damaged. A beauty ought to be perfect and Kala was a perfect beauty.Alfred wept and mamma wept and both of them wore mourning. The black dress suited mamma very well and she wore mourning the longest. Moreover she had to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry againmarry Sophy who had no appearance at all.Hes gone to the very extreme cried mammainlaw he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest and he has forgotten his first wife. Men have no endurance. My husband was of a different stamp and he died before me.Pygmalion received his Galatea said Alfred yes thats what they said in the wedding song. I had once really fallen in love with the beautiful statue which awoke to life in my arms but the kindred soul which Heaven sends down to us the angel who can feel and sympathise with and elevate us I have not found and won till now. You came Sophy not in the glory of outward beauty though you are fair fairer than is needful. The chief thing remains the chief. You came to teach the sculptor that his work is but clay and dust only an outward form in a fabric that passes away and that we must seek the essence the internal spirit. Poor Kala ours was but wayfarers life. Yonder where we shall know each other by sympathy we shall be half strangers.That was not lovingly spoken said Sophy not spoken like a Christian. Yonder where there is no giving in marriage but where as you say souls attract each other by sympathy there where everything beautiful develops itself and is elevated her soul may acquire such completeness that it may sound more harmoniously than mine and you will then once more utter the first raptured exclamation of your love Beautifulmost beautiful
It was at Palmyra New York that the principles of Mormonism were first enunciated by Joseph Smith who claimed to have found the golden plates of the Book of Mormon in a hillside in neighboring Manchesterthe Hill of Cumorahto which he was led by angels. The plates were written in characters similar to the masonic cabala and he translated them by divine aid giving to the world the result of his discovery. The Hebrew prophet Mormon was the alleged author of the record and his son Moroni buried it. The basis of Mormonism was however an unpublished novel called The Manuscript Found that was read to Sidney Rigdon afterwards a Mormon elder by its author a clergyman and that formulated a creed for a hypothetical church. Smith had a slight local celebrity for he and his father were operators with the diviningrod and when he appropriated this creed a harmless and beneficent one for polygamy was a later inspiration of Brigham Youngand began to preach it in 1844 it gained many converts. His arrogation of the presidency of the Church of Latter Day Saints and other rash performances won for him the enmity of the Gentiles who imprisoned and killed him at Carthage Missouri leaving Brigham Young to lead the people across the deserts to Salt Lake where they prospered through thrift and industry.It was claimed that in the van of this army on the march to Utah was often seen a venerable man with silver beard who never spoke but who would point the way whenever the pilgrims were faint or discouraged. When they reached the spot where the temple was afterwards built he struck his staff into the earth and vanished.At Hydesville near Palmyra spiritualism as it is commonly called came into being on March 31 1849 when certain of the departed announced themselves by thumping on doors and tables in the house of the Fox family the survivors of which confessed the fraud nearly forty years after. It is of interest to note that the ground whence these new religions sprang was peopled by the Onondagas the sacerdotal class of the Algonquin tribe who have preserved the ancient religious rites of that great family until this day.
Once upon a time there lived in the same village two children one called Sylvain and the other Jocosa who were both remarkable for beauty and intelligence. It happened that their parents were not on terms of friendship with one another on account of some old quarrel which had however taken place so long ago that they had quite forgotten what it was all about and only kept up the feud from force of habit. Sylvain and Jocosa for their parts were far from sharing this enmity and indeed were never happy when apart. Day after day they fed their flocks of sheep together and spent the long sunshiny hours in playing or resting upon some shady bank. It happened one day that the Fairy of the Meadows passed by and saw them and was so much attracted by their pretty faces and gentle manners that she took them under her protection and the older they grew the dearer they became to her. At first she showed her interest by leaving in their favourite haunts many little gifts such as they delighted to offer one to the other for they loved each other so much that their first thought was always What will Jocosa like or What will please Sylvain And the Fairy took a great delight in their innocent enjoyment of the cakes and sweetmeats she gave them nearly every day. When they were grown up she resolved to make herself known to them and chose a time when they were sheltering from the noonday sun in the deep shade of a flowery hedgerow. They were startled at first by the sudden apparition of a tall and slender lady dressed all in green and crowned with a garland of flowers. But when she spoke to them sweetly and told them how she had always loved them and that it was she who had given them all the pretty things which it had so surprised them to find they thanked her gratefully and took pleasure in answering the questions she put to them. When she presently bade them farewell she told them never to tell anyone else that they had seen her. You will often see me again added she and I shall be with you frequently even when you do not see me. So saying she vanished leaving them in a state of great wonder and excitement. After this she came often and taught them numbers of things and showed them many of the marvels of her beautiful kingdom and at last one day she said to them You know that I have always been kind to you now I think it is time you did something for me in your turn. You both remember the fountain I call my favourite Promise me that every morning before the sun rises you will go to it and clear away every stone that impedes its course and every dead leaf or broken twig that sullies its clear waters. I shall take it as a proof of your gratitude to me if you neither forget nor delay this duty and I promise that so long as the suns earliest rays find my favourite spring the clearest and sweetest in all my meadows you two shall not be parted from one another.Sylvain and Jocosa willingly undertook this service and indeed felt that it was but a very small thing in return for all that the fairy had given and promised to them. So for a long time the fountain was tended with the most scrupulous care and was the clearest and prettiest in all the country round. But one morning in the spring long before the sun rose they were hastening towards it from opposite directions when tempted by the beauty of the myriads of gay flowers which grew thickly on all sides they paused each to gather some for the other.I will make Sylvain a garland said Jocosa and How pretty Jocosa will look in this crown thought Sylvain.Hither and thither they strayed led ever farther and farther for the brightest flowers seemed always just beyond them until at last they were startled by the first bright rays of the rising sun. With one accord they turned and ran towards the fountain reaching it at the same moment though from opposite sides. But what was their horror to see its usually tranquil waters seething and bubbling and even as they looked down rushed a mighty stream which entirely engulfed it and Sylvain and Jocosa found themselves parted by a wide and swiftlyrushing river. All this had happened with such rapidity that they had only time to utter a cry and each to hold up to the other the flowers they had gathered but this was explanation enough. Twenty times did Sylvain throw himself into the turbulent waters hoping to be able to swim to the other side but each time an irresistible force drove him back upon the bank he had just quitted while as for Jocosa she even essayed to cross the flood upon a tree which came floating down torn up by the roots but her efforts were equally useless. Then with heavy hearts they set out to follow the course of the stream which had now grown so wide that it was only with difficulty they could distinguish each other. Night and day over mountains and through valleys in cold or in heat they struggled on enduring fatigue and hunger and every hardship and consoled only by the hope of meeting once moreuntil three years had passed and at last they stood upon the cliffs where the river flowed into the mighty sea.And now they seemed farther apart than ever and in despair they tried once more to throw themselves into the foaming waves. But the Fairy of the Meadows who had really never ceased to watch over them did not intend that they should be drowned at last so she hastily waved her wand and immediately they found themselves standing side by side upon the golden sand. You may imagine their joy and delight when they realised that their weary struggle was ended and their utter contentment as they clasped each other by the hand. They had so much to say that they hardly knew where to begin but they agreed in blaming themselves bitterly for the negligence which had caused all their trouble and when she heard this the Fairy immediately appeared to them. They threw themselves at her feet and implored her forgiveness which she granted freely and promised at the same time that now their punishment was ended she would always befriend them. Then she sent for her chariot of green rushes ornamented with May dewdrops which she particularly valued and always collected with great care and ordered her six shorttailed moles to carry them all back to the wellknown pastures which they did in a remarkably short time and Sylvain and Jocosa were overjoyed to see their dearlyloved home once more after all their toilful wanderings. The Fairy who had set her mind upon securing their happiness had in their absence quite made up the quarrel between their parents and gained their consent to the marriage of the faithful lovers and now she conducted them to the most charming little cottage that can be imagined close to the fountain which had once more resumed its peaceful aspect and flowed gently down into the little brook which enclosed the garden and orchard and pasture which belonged to the cottage. Indeed nothing more could have been thought of either for Sylvain and Jocosa or for their flocks and their delight satisfied even the Fairy who had planned it all to please them. When they had explored and admired until they were tired they sat down to rest under the rosecovered porch and the Fairy said that to pass the time until the wedding guests whom she had invited could arrive she would tell them a story. This is itThe Yellow BirdOnce upon a time a Fairy who had somehow or other got into mischief was condemned by the High Court of Fairyland to live for several years under the form of some creature and at the moment of resuming her natural appearance once again to make the fortune of two men. It was left to her to choose what form she would take and because she loved yellow she transformed herself into a lovely bird with shining golden feathers such as no one had ever seen before. When the time of her punishment was at an end the beautiful yellow bird flew to Bagdad and let herself be caught by a Fowler at the precise moment when BadialZaman was walking up and down outside his magnificent summer palace. This Badial Zamanwhose name means WonderoftheWorldwas looked upon in Bagdad as the most fortunate creature under the sun because of his vast wealth. But really what with anxiety about his riches and being weary of everything and always desiring something he had not he never knew a moments real happiness. Even now he had come out of his palace which was large and splendid enough for fifty kings weary and cross because he could find nothing new to amuse him. The Fowler thought that this would be a favourable opportunity for offering him the marvellous bird which he felt certain he would buy the instant he saw it. And he was not mistaken for when BadialZaman took the lovely prisoner into his own hands he saw written under its right wing the words He who eats my head will become a king and under its left wing He who eats my heart will find a hundred gold pieces under his pillow every morning. In spite of all his wealth he at once began to desire the promised gold and the bargain was soon completed. Then the difficulty arose as to how the bird was to be cooked for among all his army of servants not one could BadialZaman trust. At last he asked the Fowler if he were married and on hearing that he was he bade him take the bird home with him and tell his wife to cook it.Perhaps said he this will give me an appetite which I have not had for many a long day and if so your wife shall have a hundred pieces of silver.The Fowler with great joy ran home to his wife who speedily made a savoury stew of the Yellow Bird. But when BadialZaman reached the cottage and began eagerly to search in the dish for its head and its heart he could not find either of them and turned to the Fowlers wife in a furious rage. She was so terrified that she fell upon her knees before him and confessed that her two children had come in just before he arrived and had so teased her for some of the dish she was preparing that she had presently given the head to one and the heart to the other since these morsels are not generally much esteemed and BadialZaman rushed from the cottage vowing vengeance against the whole family. The wrath of a rich man is generally to be feared so the Fowler and his wife resolved to send their children out of harms way but the wife to console her husband confided to him that she had purposely given them the head and heart of the bird because she had been able to read what was written under its wings. So believing that their childrens fortunes were made they embraced them and sent them forth bidding them get as far away as possible to take different roads and to send news of their welfare. For themselves they remained hidden and disguised in the town which was really rather clever of them but very soon afterwards Badi alZaman died of vexation and annoyance at the loss of the promised treasure and then they went back to their cottage to wait for news of their children. The younger who had eaten the heart of the Yellow Bird very soon found out what it had done for him for each morning when he awoke he found a purse containing a hundred gold pieces under his pillow. But as all poor people may remember for their consolation nothing in the world causes so much trouble or requires so much care as a great treasure. Consequently the Fowlers son who spent with reckless profusion and was supposed to be possessed of a great hoard of gold was before very long attacked by robbers and in trying to defend himself was so badly wounded that he died.The elder brother who had eaten the Yellow Birds head travelled a long way without meeting with any particular adventure until at last he reached a large city in Asia which was all in an uproar over the choosing of a new Emir. All the principal citizens had formed themselves into two parties and it was not until after a prolonged squabble that they agreed that the person to whom the most singular thing happened should be Emir. Our young traveller entered the town at this juncture with his agreeable face and jaunty air and all at once felt something alight upon his head which proved to be a snowwhite pigeon. Thereupon all the people began to stare and to run after him so that he presently reached the palace with the pigeon upon his head and all the inhabitants of the city at his heels and before he knew where he was they made him Emir to his great astonishment.As there is nothing more agreeable than to command and nothing to which people get accustomed more quickly the young Emir soon felt quite at his ease in his new position but this did not prevent him from making every kind of mistake and so misgoverning the kingdom that at last the whole city rose in revolt and deprived him at once of his authority and his lifea punishment which he richly deserved for in the days of his prosperity he disowned the Fowler and his wife and allowed them to die in poverty.I have told you this story my dear Sylvain and Jocosa added the Fairy to prove to you that this little cottage and all that belongs to it is a gift more likely to bring you happiness and contentment than many things that would at first seem grander and more desirable. If you will faithfully promise me to till your fields and feed your flocks and will keep your word better than you did before I will see that you never lack anything that is really for your good.Sylvain and Jocosa gave their faithful promise and as they kept it they always enjoyed peace and prosperity. The Fairy had asked all their friends and neighbours to their wedding which took place at once with great festivities and rejoicings and they lived to a good old age always loving one another with all their hearts.
In a little village in the country of Japan there lived long long ago a man and his wife. For many years they were happy and prosperous but bad times came and at last nothing was left them but their daughter who was as beautiful as the morning. The neighbours were very kind and would have done anything they could to help their poor friends but the old couple felt that since everything had changed they would rather go elsewhere so one day they set off to bury themselves in the country taking their daughter with them.Now the mother and daughter had plenty to do in keeping the house clean and looking after the garden but the man would sit for hours together gazing straight in front of him and thinking of the riches that once were his. Each day he grew more and more wretched till at length he took to his bed and never got up again.His wife and daughter wept bitterly for his loss and it was many months before they could take pleasure in anything. Then one morning the mother suddenly looked at the girl and found that she had grown still more lovely than before. Once her heart would have been glad at the sight but now that they two were alone in the world she feared some harm might come of it. So like a good mother she tried to teach her daughter all she knew and to bring her up to be always busy so that she would never have time to think about herself. And the girl was a good girl and listened to all her mothers lessons and so the years passed away.At last one wet spring the mother caught cold and though in the beginning she did not pay much attention to it she gradually grew more and more ill and knew that she had not long to live. Then she called her daughter and told her that very soon she would be alone in the world that she must take care of herself as there would be no one to take care of her. And because it was more difficult for beautiful women to pass unheeded than for others she bade her fetch a wooden helmet out of the next room and put it on her head and pull it low down over her brows so that nearly the whole of her face should lie in its shadow. The girl did as she was bid and her beauty was so hidden beneath the wooden cap which covered up all her hair that she might have gone through any crowd and no one would have looked twice at her. And when she saw this the heart of the mother was at rest and she lay back in her bed and died.The girl wept for many days but byandby she felt that being alone in the world she must go and get work for she had only herself to depend upon. There was none to be got by staying where she was so she made her clothes into a bundle and walked over the hills till she reached the house of the man who owned the fields in that part of the country. And she took service with him and laboured for him early and late and every night when she went to bed she was at peace for she had not forgotten one thing that she had promised her mother and however hot the sun might be she always kept the wooden helmet on her head and the people gave her the nickname of Hatschihime.In spite however of all her care the fame of her beauty spread abroad many of the impudent young men that are always to be found in the world stole softly up behind her while she was at work and tried to lift off the wooden helmet. But the girl would have nothing to say to them and only bade them be off then they began to talk to her but she never answered them and went on with what she was doing though her wages were low and food not very plentiful. Still she could manage to live and that was enough.One day her master happened to pass through the field where she was working and was struck by her industry and stopped to watch her. After a while he put one or two questions to her and then led her into his house and told her that henceforward her only duty should be to tend his sick wife. From this time the girl felt as if all her troubles were ended but the worst of them was yet to come.Not very long after Hatschihime had become maid to the sick woman the eldest son of the house returned home from Kioto where he had been studying all sorts of things. He was tired of the splendours of the town and its pleasures and was glad enough to be back in the green country among the peachblossoms and sweet flowers. Strolling about in the early morning he caught sight of the girl with the odd wooden helmet on her head and immediately he went to his mother to ask who she was and where she came from and why she wore that strange thing over her face.His mother answered that it was a whim and nobody could persuade her to lay it aside whereat the young man laughed but kept his thoughts to himself.The girl with the wooden helmet. Illustration by H.J. Ford published in The Violet Fairy Book by Andrew Lang 1906 Longmans Green and Company.One hot day however he happened to be going towards home when he caught sight of his mothers waiting maid kneeling by a little stream that flowed through the garden splashing some water over her face. The helmet was pushed on one side and as the youth stood watching from behind a tree he had a glimpse of the girls great beauty and he determined that no one else should be his wife. But when he told his family of his resolve to marry her they were very angry and made up all sorts of wicked stories about her. However they might have spared themselves the trouble as he knew it was only idle talk. I have merely to remain firm thought he and they will have to give in. It was such a good match for the girl that it never occurred to anyone that she would refuse the young man but so it was. It would not be right she felt to make a quarrel in the house and though in secret she wept bitterly for a long while nothing would make her change her mind. At length one night her mother appeared to her in a dream and bade her marry the young man. So the next time he asked heras he did nearly every dayto his surprise and joy she consented. The parents then saw they had better make the best of a bad business and set about making the grand preparations suitable to the occasion. Of course the neighbours said a great many illnatured things about the wooden helmet but the bridegroom was too happy to care and only laughed at them.When everything was ready for the feast and the bride was dressed in the most beautiful embroidered dress to be found in Japan the maids took hold of the helmet to lift it off her head so that they might do her hair in the latest fashion. But the helmet would not come and the harder they pulled the faster it seemed to be till the poor girl yelled with pain. Hearing her cries the bridegroom ran in and soothed her and declared that she should be married in the helmet as she could not be married without. Then the ceremonies began and the bridal pair sat together and the cup of wine was brought them out of which they had to drink. And when they had drunk it all and the cup was empty a wonderful thing happened. The helmet suddenly burst with a loud noise and fell in pieces on the ground and as they all turned to look they found the floor covered with precious stones which had fallen out of it. But the guests were less astonished at the brilliancy of the diamonds than at the beauty of the bride which was beyond anything they had ever seen or heard of. The night was passed in singing and dancing and then the bride and bridegroom went to their own house where they lived till they died and had many children who were famous throughout Japan for their goodness and beauty.
When the Holy Virgin was fleeing into Egypt to escape the persecutions of Herod the Codorniz bird flew about making a great racket calling out Come this way.Keep quiet cried the Virgin. Our enemies will hear you They will come in pursuitIn spite of her words the Codorniz kept up its noise.My curse be upon you said the Virgin. You shall always walk humbly. You shall never fly high and smile at the sun.To this very day the Codorniz bird walks humbly. It has many enemies who love to slay it to devour.
Many a day has the storyteller wandered along the dykes which overlook the Zuyder Zee. Once there were fertile fields and scores of towns where water now covers all. Then fleets of ships sailed on the bosom of Lake Flevo and in the river which ran into the sea. Bright and beautiful cities dotted the shores and church bells chimed merrily for the bridal or tolled in sympathy for the sorrowing. Many were the festal days because of the wealth which the ships brought from lands near and far.But today the waters roll over the spot and The Dead Cities of the Zuyder Zee are a proverb. Yet all are not dead in one and the same sense. Some lie far down under the waves their very names forgotten because of the oceans flood which in one night centuries ago rushed in to destroy. Others languished because wealth came no longer in the ships and the seaports dried up. And one because of a foolish woman instead of holding thousands of homes and people is today only a village nestling behind the dykes. It holds a few hundred people and only a fragment of land remains of its once great area.In the distant ages of ice and gravel when the long and high glaciers of Norway poked their cold noses into Friesland Stavoren held the shrine of Stavo the stormgod. The people were very poor but many pilgrims came to worship at Stavos altars. After the new religion came into the land wealth increased because the ships traded with the warm lands in the south. A great city sprang up to which the counts of Holland granted a charter with privileges second to none. It was written that Stavoren should have the same freedom which a free city enjoys from this side of the mountains the Alps to the sea.Then there came an age of gold in Stavoren. People were so rich that the bolts and hinges and the keys and locks of their doors were made of this precious yellow metal. In some of the houses the parlor floor was paved with ducats from Spain.Now in this city lived a married couple whose wealth came from the ships. The man a merchant was a simple hearted and honest fellow who worked hard and was easily pleased.But his wife was discontented always peevish and never satisfied with anything. Even her neighbors grew tired of her whining and complaints. They declared that on her tombstone should be carved these wordsShe wanted something elseNow on every voyage made by the many ships he owned the merchant charged his captains to bring home something rare and fine as a present to his wife. Some pretty carving or picture a roll of silk for a dress a lace collar a bit of splendid tapestry a shining jewel or it may be a singing bird a strange animal for a pet a barrel of fruit or a box of sweetmeats was sure to be brought. With such gifts whether large or small the husband hoped to please his wife.But in this good purpose he could never succeed. So he began to think that it was his own fault. Being only a man he could not tell what a woman wanted. So he resolved to try his own wits and tastes to see if he could meet his wifes desires.One day when one of his best captains was about to sail on a voyage to the northeast to Dantzig which is almost as far as Russia he inquired of his badtempered vrouw what he should bring her.I want the best thing in the world said she. Now this time do bring it to me.The merchant was now very happy. He told the captain to seek out and bring back what he himself might think was the best thing on earth but to make sure he must buy a cargo of wheat.The skipper went on board hoisted anchor and set sail. Using his mans wits he also decided that wheat which makes bread was the very thing to be desired. In talking to his mates and sailors they agreed with him. Thus all the men in this matter were of one mind and the captain dreamed only of jolly times when on shore. On other voyages when he had hunted around for curiosities to please the wife of the boss he had many and anxious thoughts but now he was carefree.In Dantzig all the ships men had a good time for the captain made goed koop a fine bargain. Then the vessel richly loaded with grain turned its prow homeward. Arriving at Stavoren the skipper reported to the merchant to tell him of much money made of a sound cargo obtained of safe arrival and above all plenty of what would please his wife for what on earth could be more valuable than wheat which makes bread the staff of lifeAt lunch time when the merchant came home his wife wanted to know what made him look so joyful. Had he made goed koop that dayUsually at meal time this quiet man hardly spoke two words an hour. To tell the truth he sometimes irritated his wife because of his silence but today he was voluble.The man of wealth answered I have a joyful surprise for you. I cannot tell you now. You must come with me and see.After lunch he took his wife on board the ship giving a wink of his eye to the skipper who nodded to the sailors and then the stout fellows opened the hatches. There loaded to the very deck was the precious grain. The merchant looked up expecting to see and hear his wife clap her hands with joy.But the greedy woman turned her back on him and flew into a rage.Throw it all overboard into the water she screamed. You wretch you have deceived me.The husband tried to calm her and explain that it was his thought to get wheat as the worlds best gift hoping thus to please her.At that moment some hungry beggars standing on the wharf heard the ladys loud voice and falling on their knees cried to herPlease madame give us some of this wheat we are starving.Yes lady and there are many poor in Stavoren in spite of all its gold said the captain. Why not divide this wheat among the needy if you are greatly disappointed You will win praise for yourself. In the name of God forgive my boldness and do as I ask. Then on the next voyage I shall sail as far as China and will get you anything you askBut the angry woman would listen to no one. She stayed on the ship urging on the sailors with their shovels until every kernel was cast overboard.Never again will I try to please you said her husband. The hungry will curse you and you may yet suffer for food because of this wilful waste which will make woful want. Even you will suffer.She listened at first in silence and then put her fingers in her ears to hear no more. Proud of her riches with her voice in a high key she shouted I ever want What folly to say so I am too rich. Then to show her contempt for such words she slipped off a ring from her finger and threw it into the waters of the harbor. Her husband almost died of grief and shame when he saw that it was her wedding ring which she had cast overboard.Hear you all When that ring comes back to me I shall be hungry and not before said she loud enough to be heard on ship wharf and street. Gathering up her skirts she stepped upon the gangway tripping to the shore and past the poor people who looked at her in mingled hate and fear. Then haughtily she strode to her costly mansion.Now to celebrate the expected new triumph and to show off her wealth and luxury with the numerous curiosities brought her from many lands the proud lady had already invited a score of guests. When they were all seated the first course of soup was served in silver dishes which every one admired. As the fish was about to be brought in to be eaten off golden plates the butler begged the ladys permission to bring in first from the chief cook something rare and wonderful that he had found in the mouth of the fish which was waiting already garnished on the big dish. Not dreaming what it might be the hostess clapped her hands in glee saying to those at the tablePerhaps now at last I shall get what I have long waited forthe best thing in the world.We shall all hope so the guests responded in chorus.But when the chief cook came into the banquet hall and bowing low held before his mistress a golden salver with a finger ring on it the proud lady turned pale.It was the very ring which in her anger she had tossed overboard the day before. To add to her shame she saw from the look of horror on their faces that the guests had recognized the fact that it was her wedding token.This was only the beginning of troubles. That night her husband died of grief and vexation. The next day the warehouses stored with valuable merchandise of all sorts were burned to the ground.Before her husband had been decently buried a great tempest blew down from the north and news came that four of his ships had been wrecked. Their sailors hardly escaped with their lives and both they and their families in Stavoren were now clamoring for bread.Even when she put on her weeds of grief these did not protect the widow from her late husbands creditors. She had to sell her house and all that was in it to satisfy them and pay her debts. She had even to pawn her ring to the Lombards the goldsmiths of the town to buy money for bread.Now that she was poor none of the former rich folks who had come to her grand dinners would look at her. She had even to beg her bread on the streets for who wanted to help the woman who wasted wheat She was glad to go to the cow stalls and eat what the cattle left. Before the year ended she was found dead in a stable in rags and starvation. Thus her miserable life ended. Without a funeral but borne on a bier by two men she was buried at the expense of the city in the potters field.But even this was not the end of the fruits of her wickedness for the evil she did lived after her. It was found that from some mysterious cause a sand bar was forming in the river. This prevented the ships from coming up to the docks. With its trade stopped the city grew poorer every day. What was the matterBy and by at low tide some fishermen saw a green field under the surface of the harbor. It was not a garden of seaweed for instead of leaves whirling with the tide there were stalks that stood up high. The wheat had sprouted and taken root. In another month the tops of these stalks were visible above the water. But in such soil as sand the wheat had reverted to its wild state. It was good for nothing but only did harm.For while producing no grain for food it held together the sand which rolled down the river and had come all the way from the Alps to the ocean. Of old this went out to sea and kept the harbor scoured clean so that the ships came clear up to the wharves. Then on many a morning a wealthy merchant whose house was close to the docks looked out of his window to find the prows of his richly laden ships poked almost into his bedroom and he liked it. Venturesome boys even climbed from their cots down the bowsprits on to the deck of their fathers vessels. Of such sons the fathers were proud knowing that they would make brave sailors and navigate spice ships from the Indies. It was because of her brave mariners that Stavoren had gained her glory and greatness being famed in all the land.But now within so short a time the citys renown and wealth had faded like a dream. By degrees the population diminished commerce became a memory and ships a curiosity. The people that were left had to eat rye and barley bread instead of wheat. Floods ruined the farmers and washed away large parts of the town so that dykes had to be built to save what was left.More terrible than all the ocean waves rolled in and wiped out cities towns and farms sinking churches convents monasteries warehouses wharves and docks in one common ruin hidden far down below.To this day the worthless wheat patch that spoiled Stavoren is called Vrouwen Zand or the Ladys Sand. Instead of being the staff of life as Nature intended the wheat because of a power of evil greater than that of a thousand wicked fairies became the menace of death to ruin a rich city.No wonder the Dutch have a proverb which might be thus translatedPeevishness perverts wheat into weedsBut a sweet temper turns a field into gold.
Three brothers lived with their old Indian mother in the forest near the sea. Their father had long been dead. At his death he had little of the worlds goods to his credit and his widow and her sons were very poor. In the place where they dwelt the game was not plentiful and to get food enough to keep them from want they had often to go far into the forest. The youngest boy was smaller and weaker than the others and when the two older sons went far away to hunt they always left him behind for although he always wished to accompany them they would never allow him to go. He had to do all the work about the house and all day long he gathered wood in the forest and carried water from the stream. And even when his brothers went out in the springtime to draw sap from the maple trees he was never permitted to go with them. He was always making mistakes and doing foolish things. His brothers called him Thickhead and all the people round about said he was a simpleton because of his slow and queer ways. His mother alone was kind to him and she always said They may laugh at you and call you fool but you will prove to be wiser than all of them yet for so it was told me by a forest fairy at your birth.The Chief of the people had a beautiful daughter who had many suitors. But her father spurned them all from his door and said My daughter is not yet of age to marry and when her time of marriage comes she will only marry the man who can make great profit from hunting. The two older sons of the old woman decided that one of them must win the girl. So they prepared to set out on a great hunting expedition far away in the northern forest for it was now autumn and the hunters moon had come. The youngest boy wanted to go with them for he had never been away from home and he wished to see the world. And his mother said he might go.His brothers were very angry when they heard his request and they said Much good Thickhead can do us in the chase. He will only bring us bad luck. He is not a hunter but a scullion and a drudge fit only for the fireside. But his mother commanded them to grant the boys wish and they had to obey. So the three brothers set out for the north country the two older brothers grumbling loudly because they were accompanied by the boy they thought a fool.The two older brothers had good success in the chase and they killed many animalsdeer and rabbits and otters and beavers. And they came home bearing a great quantity of dried meat and skins. They each thought Now we have begun to prove our prowess to the Chief and if we succeed as well next year when the hunters moon comes again one of us will surely win his daughter when she is old enough to marry. But all the youngest boy brought home as a result of his journey into the game country was a large EarthWorm as thick as his finger and as long as his arm. It was the biggest EarthWorm he had ever seen. He thought it a great curiosity as well as a great discovery and he was so busy watching it each day that he had no time to hunt. When he brought it home in a box his brothers said to their mother What did we tell you about Thickhead He has now surely proved himself a fool. He has caught only a fat EarthWorm in all these weeks. And they noised it abroad in the village and all the people laughed loudly at the simpleton until Thickheads hunt became a byword in all the land. But the boys mother only smiled and said He will surprise them all yet.The boy kept the EarthWorm in a tiny pen just outside the door of his home. One day a large Duck came waddling along and sticking her bill over the little fence of the pen she quickly gobbled up the Worm. The boy was very angry and he went to the man who owned the Duck and said Your Duck ate up my pet Worm. I want my Worm.The man offered to pay him whatever price he asked but the boy said I do not want your price. I want my Worm.But the man said How can I give you your Worm when my Duck has eaten it up It is gone for ever.And the boy said It is not gone. It is in the Ducks belly. So I must have the Duck. Then to avoid further trouble the man gave Thickhead the Duck for he thought to himself What is the use of arguing with a fool.The boy took the Duck home and kept it in a little pen near his home with a low fence around it. And he tied a great weight to its foot so that it could not fly away. He was quite happy again for he thought Now I have both my Worm and the Duck. But one day a Fox came prowling along looking for food. He saw the fat Duck tied by the foot in the little pen. And he said What good fortune There is a choice meal for me and in a twinkling he was over the fence. The Duck quacked and made a great noise but she was soon silenced. The Fox had just finished eating up the Duck when the boy who had heard the quacking came running out of the house. The Fox was smacking his lips after his good meal and he was too slow in getting away. The boy fell to beating him with a stout club and soon killed him and threw his body into the yard behind the house. And he thought That is not so bad. Now I have my Worm and the Duck and the Fox.That night an old Wolf came through the forest in search of food. He was very hungry and in the bright moonlight he saw the dead Fox lying in the yard. He pounced upon it greedily and devoured it until not a trace of it was left. But the boy saw him before he could get away and he came stealthily upon him and killed him with a blow of his axe. I am surely in good luck he thought for now I have the Worm and the Duck and the Fox and the Wolf.But the next day when he told his brothers of his good fortune and his great skill they laughed at him loudly and said Much good a dead Wolf will do you. Before two days have passed it will be but an foulsmelling thing and we shall have to bury it deep. You are indeed a great fool.The boy pondered for a long time over what they had said and he thought Perhaps they are right. The dead Wolf cannot last long. I will save the skin. So he skinned the Wolf and dried the skin and made a drum from it. For the drum was one of the few musical instruments of the Indians in those old times and they beat it loudly at all their dances and festivals. The boy beat the drum each evening and made a great noise and he was very proud because he had the only drum in the whole village.One day the Chief sent for him and said to him I want to borrow your drum for this evening. I am having a great gathering to announce to all the land that my daughter is now of age to marry and that suitors may now seek her hand in marriage. But we have no musical instruments and I want your drum and I myself will beat it at the dance.So Thickhead brought his drum to the Chiefs house but he was not very well pleased because he was not invited to the feast while his brothers were among the favoured guests. And he said to the Chief Be very careful. Do not tear the skin of my drum for I can never get another like it. My Worm and my Duck and my Fox and my Wolf have all helped to make it.The next day he went for his drum. But the Chief had struck it too hard and had split it open so that it would now make no sound and it was ruined beyond repair. He offered to pay the boy a great price for it but the boy said I do not want your price. I want my drum. Give me back my drum for my Worm and the Duck and the Fox and the Wolf are all in it.The Chief said How can I give you back your drum when it is broken It is gone for ever. I will give you anything you desire in exchange for it. Since you do not like the price I offer you may name your own price and you shall have it. And the boy thought to himself Here is a chance for good fortune. Now I shall surprise my brothers.And he said Since you cannot give me my drum I will take your daughter in marriage in exchange. The Chief was much perplexed but he had to be true to his word. So he gave his daughter to Thickhead and they were married and the girl brought him much treasure and they lived very happily. And his brothers were much amazed and angered because they had failed. But his mother said I told you he was wiser than you and that he would outwit you yet although you called him Thickhead and fool. For the forest fairy said it to me at his birth.
Chief Oborri lived at a town called Adiagor which is on the right bank of the Calabar River. He was a wealthy chief and belonged to the Egbo Society. He had many large canoes and plenty of slaves to paddle them. These canoes he used to fill up with new yamseach canoe being under one head slave and containing eight paddles the canoes were capable of holding three puncheons of palmoil and cost eight hundred rods each. When they were full about ten of them used to start off together and paddle to Rio del Rey. They went through creeks all the way which run through mangrove swamps with palmoil trees here and there. Sometimes in the tornado season it was very dangerous crossing the creeks as the canoes were so heavily laden having only a few inches above the water that quite a small wave would fill the canoe and cause it to sink to the bottom. Although most of the boys could swim it often happened that some of them were lost as there are many large alligators in these waters. After four days hard paddling they would arrive at Rio del Rey where they had very little difficulty in exchanging their new yams for bags of dried shrimps and sticks with smoked fish on them.Chief Oborri had two sons named Eyo I. and Essido. Their mother having died when they were babies the children were brought up by their father. As they grew up they developed entirely different characters. The eldest was very hardworking and led a solitary life but the younger son was fond of gaiety and was very lazy in fact he spent most of his time in the neighbouring towns playing and dancing. When the two boys arrived at the respective ages of eighteen and twenty their father died and they were left to look after themselves. According to native custom the elder son Eyo I. was entitled to the whole of his fathers estate but being very fond of his younger brother he gave him a large number of rods and some land with a house. Immediately Essido became possessed of the money he became wilder than ever gave big feasts to his companions and always had his house full of women upon whom he spent large sums. Although the amount his brother had given him on his fathers death was very large in the course of a few years Essido had spent it all. He then sold his house and effects and spent the proceeds on feasting.While he had been living this gay and unprofitable life Eyo I. had been working harder than ever at his fathers old trade and had made many trips to Rio del Rey himself. Almost every week he had canoes laden with yams going down river and returning after about twelve days with shrimps and fish which Eyo I. himself disposed of in the neighbouring markets and he very rapidly became a rich man. At intervals he remonstrated with Essido on his extravagance but his warnings had no effect if anything his brother became worse. At last the time arrived when all his money was spent so Essido went to his brother and asked him to lend him two thousand rods but Eyo refused and told Essido that he would not help him in any way to continue his present life of debauchery but that if he liked to work on the farm and trade he would give him a fair share of the profits. This Essido indignantly refused and went back to the town and consulted some of the very few friends he had left as to what was the best thing to do.The men he spoke to were thoroughly bad men and had been living upon Essido for a long time. They suggested to him that he should go round the town and borrow money from the people he had entertained and then they would run away to Akpabryos town which was about four days march from Calabar. This Essido did and managed to borrow a lot of money although many people refused to lend him anything. Then at night he set off with his evil companions who carried his money as they had not been able to borrow any themselves being so well known. When they arrived at Akpabryos town they found many beautiful women and graceful dancers. They then started the same life again until after a few weeks most of the money had gone. They then met and consulted together how to get more money and advised Essido to return to his rich brother pretending that he was going to work and give up his old life he should then get poison from a man they knew of and place it in his brothers food so that he would die and then Essido would become possessed of all his brothers wealth and they would be able to live in the same way as they had formerly. Essido who had sunk very low agreed to this plan and they left Akpabryos town the next morning. After marching for two days they arrived at a small hut in the bush where a man who was an expert poisoner lived called Okponesip. He was the head Ju Ju man of the country and when they had bribed him with eight hundred rods he swore them to secrecy and gave Essido a small parcel containing a deadly poison which he said would kill his brother in three months. All he had to do was to place the poison in his brothers food.When Essido returned to his brothers house he pretended to be very sorry for his former mode of living and said that for the future he was going to work. Eyo I. was very glad when he heard this and at once asked his brother in and gave him new clothes and plenty to eat.In the evening when supper was being prepared Essido went into the kitchen pretending he wanted to get a light from the fire for his pipe. The cook being absent and no one about he put the poison in the soup and then returned to the livingroom. He then asked for some tombo which was brought and when he had finished it he said he did not want any supper and went to sleep. His brother Eyo I. had supper by himself and consumed all the soup. In a weeks time he began to feel very ill and as the days passed he became worse so he sent for his Ju Ju man.When Essido saw him coming he quietly left the house but the Ju Ju man by casting lots very soon discovered that it was Essido who had given poison to his brother. When he told Eyo I. this he would not believe it and sent him away. However when Essido returned his elder brother told him what the Ju Ju man had said but that he did not believe him for one moment and had sent him away. Essido was much relieved when he heard this but as he was anxious that no suspicion of the crime should be attached to him he went to the Household Ju Juand having first sworn that he had never administered poison to his brother he drank out of the pot.Three months after he had taken the poison Eyo I. died much to the grief of every one who knew him as he was much respected not only on account of his great wealth but because he was also an upright and honest man who never did harm to any one.Essido kept his brothers funeral according to the usual custom and there was much playing and dancing which was kept up for a long time. Then Essido paid off his old creditors in order to make himself popular and kept open house entertaining most lavishly and spending his money in many foolish ways. All the bad women about collected at his house and his old evil companions went on as they had done before.Things got so bad that none of the respectable people would have anything to do with him and at last the chiefs of the country seeing the way Essido was squandering his late brothers estate assembled together and eventually came to the conclusion that he was a witch man and had poisoned his brother in order to acquire his position. The chiefs who were all friends of the late Eyo and who were very sorry at the death as they knew that if he had lived he would have become a great and powerful chief made up their minds to give Essido the Ekpawor Ju Ju which is a very strong medicine and gets into mens heads so that when they have drunk it they are compelled to speak the truth and if they have done wrong they die very shortly. Essido was then told to dress himself and attend the meeting at the palaver house and when he arrived the chiefs charged him with having killed his brother by witchcraft. Essido denied having done so but the chiefs told him that if he were innocent he must prove it by drinking the bowl of Ekpawor medicine which was placed before him. As he could not refuse to drink he drank the bowl off in great fear and trembling and very soon the Ju Ju having got hold of him he confessed that he had poisoned his brother but that his friends had advised him to do so. About two hours after drinking the Ekpawor Essido died in great pain.The friends were then brought to the meeting and tied up to posts and questioned as to the part they had taken in the death of Eyo. As they were too frightened to answer the chiefs told them that they knew from Essido that they had induced him to poison his brother. They were then taken to the place where Eyo was buried the grave having been dug open and their heads were cut off and fell into the grave and their bodies were thrown in after them as a sacrifice for the wrong they had done. The grave was then filled up again.Ever since that time whenever any one is suspected of being a witch he is tried by the Ekpawor Ju Ju.
It is now centuries since a young noble of the neighbourhood was hunting in the valleys which lie behind the hills that skirt the Rhine opposite the ancient town of St. Goar. In the heat of the pursuit he followed the game to the foot of the acclivity on which are seated the ruins of Thurnberg and there it disappeared all at once from his view. It was the noon of a midsummer day and the sun shone down on him with all its strength. Despairing of being able to find the object of his pursuit he determined to clamber up the steep hillside and seek shelter and repose in the shadow of the old castle or mayhap in one of its many crumbling chambers. With much labour he succeeded in reaching the summit and there fatigued with his toil and parched with a burning thirst he flung himself on the ground beneath one of the huge towers some of whose remains still rear their heads on high and stretched out his tired limbs in the full enjoyment of rest.Now said he as he wiped the perspiration from his brownow could I be happy indeed if some kind being would bring me a beaker of the cool wine which they say is ages old down there in the cellars of this castle.He had scarce spoken the words when a most beautiful maiden stepped forth from a cleft in the ivycovered ruin bearing in one hand a huge silver beaker of an antique form full to the very brim of foaming wine. In her other hand she held a large bunch of keys of all sizes. She was clad in white from head to foot her hair was flaxen her skin was like a lily and she had such loving eyes that they at once won the heart of the young noble.Here said she handing him the beaker thy wish is granted. Drink and be satisfied.His heart leaped within him with joy at her condescension and he emptied the contents of the goblet at a single draught. All the while she looked at him in such a manner as to intoxicate his very soul so kindly and confidential were her glances. The wine coursed through his veins like liquid fire his heart soon burned with love for the maiden and the fever of his blood was by no means appeased by the furtive looks which ever and anon she cast upon him. She apparently read his state of mind and when his passion was at its highest pitch and all restraint seemed put an end to by the potent effects of love and wine she disappeared in a moment by the way she came. The noble rushed after her in the hope of detaining the fugitive or at least of catching a parting glimpse of her retreating form but the ivyencircled cleft through which she seemed to have flitted looked as though it had not been disturbed for centuries and as he tried to force his way to the gloomy cavern below a crowd of bats and owls and other foul birds of evil omen aroused from their repose rose upwards and amidst dismal hootings and fearful cries almost flung him backward with the violence of their flight. He spent the remainder of the afternoon in search of the lost one but without success. At the coming of night he wended his way homeward weary heartsick and overwhelmed with an indefinable sensation of sadness.From that day forth he was an altered manaltered in appearance as well as in mind and in manners. Pleasure was a stranger to his soul and he knew no longer what it was to enjoy peace. Wherever he went whatever pursuit he was engaged in whether in the chase in the hall in ladys bower or in chapel his eye only saw one objectthe White Maiden. At the board she stood in imagination always before him offering to his fevered lips the cool brimming beaker and in the longdrawn aisles of the chapel she was ever present beckoning him from his devotions to partake of the generous beverage which she still bore in her right hand. Every matron or maiden he met seemed by some wondrous process to take her shape and even the very trees of the forest all looked to his thought like her.Thenceforward he commenced to haunt the ruins in which she had appeared to him still hoping to see once again her for whom he felt he was dying and living alone in that hope. The sun scorched him but it was nothing to the fever that burned within him. The rain drenched him but he cared not for it. Time and change and circumstance seemed all forgotten by him everything passed by him unheeded. His whole existence was completely swallowed up in one thoughtthe White Maiden of the ruined castle and that alas was only vexation of spirit. A deadly fever seized him. It was a mortal disease. Still he raved in his delirium but of her. One morn a woodman who occasionally provided him with food found him a corpse at the entrance of the crevice in the wall whence the maiden had seemed to come and where she had disappeared. It was long rumoured that he had struggled bravely with deathor rather that he could not die because the curse was upon himuntil the maiden garbed in white as usual appeared to him once more. That then he stretched forth his handsshe stooped over him. He raised his headshe kissed his lipsand he died.The White Maiden tradition says has not since been seen in the ruins of Thurnberg.
Once long ago there lived near the ancient city of Strasburg on the river Rhine a young and handsome count whose name was Otto. As the years flew by he remained unwed and never so much as cast a glance at the fair maidens of the country round for this reason people began to call him StoneHeart.It chanced that Count Otto on one Christmas Eve ordered that a great hunt should take place in the forest surrounding his castle. He and his guests and his many retainers rode forth and the chase became more and more exciting. It led through thickets and over pathless tracts of forest until at length Count Otto found himself separated from his companions.He rode on by himself until he came to a spring of clear bubbling water known to the people around as the Fairy Well. Here Count Otto dismounted. He bent over the spring and began to lave his hands in the sparkling tide but to his wonder he found that though the weather was cold and frosty the water was warm and delightfully caressing. He felt a glow of joy pass through his veins and as he plunged his hands deeper he fancied that his right hand was grasped by another soft and small which gently slipped from his finger the gold ring he always wore. And lo when he drew out his hand the gold ring was gone.Full of wonder at this mysterious event the count mounted his horse and returned to his castle resolving in his mind that the very next day he would have the Fairy Well emptied by his servants.He retired to his room and throwing himself just as he was upon his couch tried to sleep but the strangeness of the adventure kept him restless and wakeful.Suddenly he heard the hoarse baying of the watchhounds in the courtyard and then the creaking of the drawbridge as though it were being lowered. Then came to his ear the patter of many small feet on the stone staircase and next he heard indistinctly the sound of light footsteps in the chamber adjoining his own.Count Otto sprang from his couch and as he did so there sounded a strain of delicious music and the door of his chamber was flung open. Hurrying into the next room he found himself in the midst of numberless Fairy beings clad in gay and sparkling robes. They paid no heed to him but began to dance and laugh and sing to the sound of mysterious music.In the center of the apartment stood a splendid Christmas Tree the first ever seen in that country. Instead of toys and candles there hung on its lighted boughs diamond stars pearl necklaces bracelets of gold ornamented with colored jewels aigrettes of rubies and sapphires silken belts embroidered with Oriental pearls and daggers mounted in gold and studded with the rarest gems. The whole tree swayed sparkled and glittered in the radiance of its many lights.Count Otto stood speechless gazing at all this wonder when suddenly the Fairies stopped dancing and fell back to make room for a lady of dazzling beauty who came slowly toward him.She wore on her ravenblack tresses a golden diadem set with jewels. Her hair flowed down upon a robe of rosy satin and creamy velvet. She stretched out two small white hands to the count and addressed him in sweet alluring tonesDear Count Otto said she I come to return your Christmas visit. I am Ernestine the Queen of the Fairies. I bring you something you lost in the Fairy Well.And as she spoke she drew from her bosom a golden casket set with diamonds and placed it in his hands. He opened it eagerly and found within his lost gold ring.Carried away by the wonder of it all and overcome by an irresistible impulse the count pressed the Fairy Ernestine to his heart while she holding him by the hand drew him into the magic mazes of the dance. The mysterious music floated through the room and the rest of that Fairy company circled and whirled around the Fairy Queen and Count Otto and then gradually dissolved into a mist of many colors leaving the count and his beautiful guest alone.Then the young man forgetting all his former coldness toward the maidens of the countryround about fell on his knees before the Fairy and besought her to become his bride. At last she consented on the condition that he should never speak the word death in her presence.The next day the wedding of Count Otto and Ernestine Queen of the Fairies was celebrated with great pomp and magnificence and the two continued to live happily for many years.Now it happened on a time that the count and his Fairy wife were to hunt in the forest around the castle. The horses were saddled and bridled and standing at the door the company waited and the count paced the hall in great impatience but still the Fairy Ernestine tarried long in her chamber. At length she appeared at the door of the hall and the count addressed her in anger.You have kept us waiting so long he cried that you would make a good messenger to send for DeathScarcely had he spoken the forbidden and fatal word when the Fairy uttering a wild cry vanished from his sight. In vain Count Otto overwhelmed with grief and remorse searched the castle and the Fairy Well no trace could he find of his beautiful lost wife but the imprint of her delicate hand set in the stone arch above the castle gate.Years passed by and the Fairy Ernestine did not return. The count continued to grieve. Every Christmas Eve he set up a lighted tree in the room where he had first met the Fairy hoping in vain that she would return to him. Time passed and the count died. The castle fell into ruins. But to this day may be seen above the massive gate deeply sunken in the stone arch the impress of a small and delicate hand.And such say the good folk of Strasburg was the origin of the Christmas Tree.
There was once a poor shepherdboy whose father and mother were dead and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man who was to feed him and bring him up. The man and his wife had however bad hearts and were greedy and anxious about their riches and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. The poor young fellow might do what he liked he got little to eat but only so many blows the more.One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens but she ran through a quickset hedge with them and a hawk darted down instantly and carried her off through the air. The boy called Thief thief rascal with all the strength of his body. But what good did that do The hawk did not bring its prey back again. The man heard the noise and ran to the spot and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone he fell in a rage and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen but now his difficulty was greater for one ran here and the other there. He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him. But he was very much mistaken. After two days worn out with running about and hunger he fell asleep the bird of prey came and seized one of the chickens and as the others were tied fast to it it carried them all off together perched itself on a tree and devoured them. The farmer was just coming home and when he saw the misfortune he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days.When he was on his legs again the farmer said to him Thou art too stupid for me I cannot make a herdsman of thee thou must go as errandboy. Then he sent him to the judge to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes and he gave him a letter as well. On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes. He took the basket to the judge but when the judge had read the letter and counted the bunches he said Two clusters are wanting. The boy confessed quite honestly that driven by hunger and thirst he had devoured the two which were wanting. The judge wrote a letter to the farmer and asked for the same number of grapes again. These also the boy had to take to him with a letter. As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty he could not help it and again ate two bunches. But first he took the letter out of the basket put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him. The judge however again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches. Ah said the boy how have you learnt that The letter could not know about it for I put it under a stone before I did it. The judge could not help laughing at the boys simplicity and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better and not let him want for meat and drink and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong.I will soon show thee the difference said the hard man if thou wilt eat thou must work and if thou dost anything wrong thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows.The next day he set him a hard task. He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses and then the man threatened In five hours said he I shall be back again and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb. The farmer went with his wife the manservant and the girl to the yearly fair and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting and in his haste without noticing it he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late there was no repairing it. Ah cried he now all is over with me The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing if he comes back and sees what I have done he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life.The boy had once heard the farmers wife say I have a pot with poison in it under my bed. She however had only said that to keep away greedy people for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed brought out the pot and ate all that was in it. I do not know said he folks say death is bitter but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmers wife has so often longed for death. He seated himself in a little chair and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food. It cannot have been poison thought he but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes that no doubt will be the true poison and bring death to me. It was however no poison for flies but Hungarian wine. The boy got out the bottle and emptied it. This death tastes sweet too said he but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him he thought his end was drawing near. I feel that I must die said he I will go away to the churchyard and seek a grave. He staggered out reached the churchyard and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept when he heard the music he fancied he was already in Paradise until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again the heat of the strong wine and the cold nightdew deprived him of life and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself.When the farmer heard the news of the boys death he was terrified and afraid of being brought to justice indeed his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground. His wife who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat ran to him to help him. But the flames darted against the pan the whole house caught fire in a few hours it lay in ashes and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery tormented by the pangs of conscience.
The AntingAnting is a stone or other small object covered with cabalistic inscriptions. It is worn around the neck and is supposed to render its owner impervious to knife or bullet. Many are wearing these charms especially the Tulisanes or outlaws. The AntingAnting must not be confused however with the scapular a purely religious symbol worn by a great number of the Christian Filipinos.Many of the older Filipinos remember Manuelito the great Tulisane who more than fifty years ago kept all the Laguna de Bai district in a state of fear. His robber band was well organized and obeyed his slightest wish. He had many boats on the lake and many hiding places in the mountains and throughout the country there was no villager who did not fear to oppose him or who would refuse to help him in any way when required to do so.In vain the Guardia Civil hunted him. Many times they surrounded the band but Manuelito always escaped. Many shots were fired at him but he was never hit and once when he was cut off from his men and surrounded he broke through the line and though fifty bullets whistled around him he did not receive a scratch.The officers of the Guardia Civil blamed their men for the bad marksmanship that allowed Manuelito to escape. They told all the people that it should never occur again and promised that the next fight should end in the death of the outlaw. The people however did not believe that Manuelito could be killed for he wore on his breast a famous AntingAnting that he had received from Mangagauay the giver of life and death.This charm was a stone covered with mysterious signs. It was wrapped in silk and hung by a string from the robbers neck and even if a gun were fired within a few feet of him the AntingAnting was sure to turn the bullet in another direction. It was this charm that always saved him from the Guardia Civil.Manuelito was very proud of his AntingAnting and many times when a fiesta was being held in some town he and his band would come down from the mountains and take part in the games. Manuelito would stand in the town plaza and allow his men to shoot at him and each time the AntingAnting would turn aside the bullets. The people were very much impressed and though a few of the wiser ones secretly thought that the guns were only loaded with powder they were afraid to say anything so the greater number thought it very wonderful and believed that there was no charm so powerful as the AntingAnting of Manuelito.For years the Tulisane protected by his charm continued to rob and plunder. The Guardia Civil hunted him everywhere but could never kill him. He grew bolder and bolder and even came close to Manila to rob the little towns just outside the city.At last the government grew tired of sending out the Guardia Civil and ordered a regiment of Macabebes to hunt and kill the Tulisane and his men.Manuelito was at Pasay when news was brought to him that the Macabebes were coming. Instead of running from these fierce little fighters he decided to meet them and many people offered to help him believing that the AntingAnting would turn away all bullets and give them victory. So Manuelito and many men left the town built trenches in the hills near San Pedro Macati and waited for the Macabebes to appear.They had not long to wait. The Macabebes hurrying from Manila reached San Pedro Macati and soon found that Manuelito was waiting to fight them. They left the town at once and advanced on the Tulisane trenches.It was a great fight. From the other hills close by many people watched the battle. Five times the Macabebes advanced and were forced to fall back before the fierce fire of the Tulisanes. But the Macabebe never knows defeat and once more their line went forward and in one terrible charge swept over the trenches and bayoneted the outlaws. In vain Manuelito called on his men to fight. They broke and ran in every direction. Then seeing that all was lost Manuelito started to follow them but a volley rang out and struck by twenty bullets he fell to the ground dead. The Macabebes chased the flying Tulisanes and killed that of all the band only a few many safely reached the mountains.While the Macabebes were chasing the outlaws many people came down from the hills and stood around the body of Manuelito. They could hardly believe their eyes but the many wounds and the blood staining the ground proved that the great Tulisane was indeed dead.What of the AntingAnting Had it lost its powerOne man timidly unbuttoned the shirt of the dead robber and pulled out the charm. The mystery was explained. Fixed firmly in the center of the AntingAnting was a silver bullet. There was but one explanation. The Macabebes had melted a statue of the Virgin and used it to make bullets to fire at Manuelito. Against such bullets the charm was useless but against ordinary lead it never would have failed. Had not the people seen Manuelitos own men fire at himThe charm was taken from the neck of the dead Tulisane and many copies were made of it. Even to this day hundreds of people are wearing them. They will tell you about Manuelitos great fight and also about his famous AntingAnting.But you say the AntingAnting was useless. Manuelito was killed.They answer Yes Seor it is true but the Macabebes used bullets of silver. Had they used lead the story would have been different. Poor Manuelito
The flames leapt gaily upward in the wide fireplace throwing strange shadows on the painted walls and gleaming on the polished wood of floor and beam and cupboard. Little Jan basked contentedly in the warmth almost dozingnow absently stroking the terrier curled up beside him now running his fingers through the softer fur of the rug on which he lay. It was made of silverjackal skinsa dozen of them to judge from the six bushy tails spread out on either side and as Outa Karels gaze rested on them he remarked reminiscentlyArr but Oom Jakhals was a slim kerel No one ever got the better of him without paying for it.In an instant little Jan was sitting bolt upright every symptom of sleep banished from his face the book from which Willem had been laboriously trying to gain some idea of the physical features of Russia was flung to the far end of the rustbank while Pietie suspending for a brief moment his whittling of a catapult stick slid along the floor to get within better sight and sound of the storyteller.Yes my little masters sometimes it was Oom Leeuw he cheated sometimes it was Oubaas Babiaan or Oom Wolf and once it was the poor little Dove and that is what made me think of how he was cheated himself.Did the little Dove cheat him asked Pietie eagerly.No baasje the Dove is too frightenednot stupid baasje but like people are when they are too gentle and kind and believe everything other people tell them. She was sitting on her nest one day singing to her little children Coooo coooo coooo when Oom Jakhals prowled along under the tree and heard her.Alla wereld Now Ill have a nice breakfast he thought and he called out Good morning Tante. I hear you have such pretty little children. Please bring them down for me to see.But the Tante was frightened of Jakhals and said Im sorry Oom they are not well today and I must keep them at home.Then Jakhals lost his temper and called out Nonsense Im hungry and want something to eat so throw down one of your little children at once.Baasjes know sometimes crossness drives away frightenness and Tante was so cross with Oom Jakhals for wanting to eat one of her little children that she called out No no you bad Jakhals I shall do nothing of the sort. Go away and look for other food.If you dont Ill fly up and eat them all said Jakhals. Throw one down at once. And he stamped about and made such a horrible noise that the poor Tante thought he was really flying up. She looked at her babies there wasnt one she wanted to give but it was better to lose one than have them all eaten so she shut her eyes and fluttered about the nest till one of them fell out and Jakhals caught it in his mouth and carried it off to his hole to eat.Ach but the poor Tante was sad She spread her wings over her other children and never slept all night but looked about this way and that way with her soft eyes thinking every little noise she heard was Oom Jakhals trying to fly up to her nest to gobble up all her babies.The next morning there was Oom Jakhals again. Tante your child was a nice juicy mouthful. Throw me down another. And make haste do you hear or Ill fly up and eat you all.Coooo coooo coooo said Tante crying no I wont give you one. But it was no use and in the end she did what she had done beforejust shut her eyes and fluttered round and round till a baby fell out of the nest. She thought there was no help for it and like some people are she thought what the eye didnt see the heart wouldnt feel but her heart was very sore and she cried more sadly than ever and this time she said Oooo oooo oooo It was very sad and sorrowful to listen to Oooo oooo ooooHere came old Oom Reijer. He is a kind old bird though he holds his neck so crooked and looks like there was nothing to smile at in the whole wide world.Ach why do you cry so sadly Tante It nearly gives me a stitch in my side.Oooo Im very miserable. Oom Jakhals has eaten two of my little children and tomorrow he will come for another and soon I shall have none left.But why did you let him eat themBecause he said if I didnt give him one he would fly up and eat them all. OoooooThen Oom Reijer was very angry. He flapped his wings and stretched out his long neckso my baasjes just so the children hugged themselves in silent delight at Outas fine actingand he opened and shut his long beak to show how he would like to peck out Oom Jakhalss wicked eyes if he could only catch him.That vervlakste Jakhals he said. To tell such lies But Tante you are stupid. Dont you know Oom Jakhals cant fly Now listen to me. When he comes again tell him you know he cant fly and that you wont give him any more of your children.The next day there came Oom Jakhals again with his old story but Tante just laughed at him.Ach no you storytelling Bushytail she said I wont give you any more of my little children and you neednt say youll fly up and eat them because I know you cant.Nierrr nierrr said Oom Jakhals growling how do you know thatOom Reijer told me so there said Tante. And you can just go to your motherMy but Tante was getting brave now that she knew she and her little children were safe. That was the worst insult you can ever give a grownup jakhals and Oom Jakhals growled more than ever.Never mind he said at last Tante is only a vrouwmens I wont bother with her any more. But wait till I catch Oom Reijer. Hell be sorry he poked his long nose into my business the old meddler and he trotted off to look for him.He hunted and hunted and at last he found him standing on one leg at the side of the river with his long neck drawn in and his head resting on his shoulders.Good day Oom Reijer he said politely. How is Oom todayIm all right answered Oom Reijer shortly without moving an inch.Jakhals spoke in a little small voiceach toch so humble. Oom please come this way a little Im so stupid but you are so wise and clever and I want to ask your advice about something.Oom Reijer began to listen. It is maar so when people hear about themselves. He put down his other leg stretched out his neck and asked over his shoulder What did you say ehCome toch this way a little the mud over there is too soft for me to stand on. I want your valuable advice about the wind. The other people all say I must ask you because no one is as wise as you.Truly Jakhals was a slim kerel He knew how to stroke Oom Reijers feathers the right way.Oom Reijer came slowly over the muda person mustnt show he is too pleased he even stopped to swallow a little frog on the way and then he said carelesslike Yes I can tell you all about the wind and weather. Ask what you like Jakhals. His long neck twisted about with pride.Oom when the wind is from the west how must one hold ones headIs that all said Oom Reijer. Just so. And he turned his head to the east.Thank you Oom. And when the wind is from the eastSo. Oom Reijer bent his neck the other way.Thank you Oom said the little small voice so grateful and humble. But when there is a storm and the rain beats down how thenSo said Oom Reijer and he bent his neck down till his head nearly touched his toes.My little masters just as quickly as a whipsnake shoots into his hole so Jakhals shot out his arm and caught Oom Reijer on the bend of his neckcrackand in a minute the poor old bird was rolling in the mud with his neck nearly broken and so weak that he couldnt even lift his beak to peck at the false wicked eyes that were staring at him.O how glad was cruel Jakhals He laughed till he couldnt any more. He screamed and danced with pleasure. He waved his bushy tail and the silver mane on his back bristled as he jumped about.Ha ha ha Oom thought to do me a bad turn but Ill teach people not to interfere with me. Ha ha ha No one is as wise as Oom Reijer eh Then he will soon find out how to mend his broken neck. Ha ha haJakhals gave one last spring right over poor Oom Reijer and danced off to his den in the kopjes to tell Tante Jakhals and the little Jakhalsjes how he had cheated Oom Reijer.And from that day baasjes Oom Reijers neck is crooked he cant hold it straight and its all through trying to interfere with Jakhals. That is why I said Jakhals is a slim kerel. Whether he walks on four legs or on two the best is maar to leave him alone because he can always make a plan and no one ever gets the better of him without paying for it in the end.
It was Christmas eve. Old Santa Claus was just ready to start out upon his long journey over the snowy treetops and roofs to find the waiting chimneys and the little empty stockings. Such a busy day as it had beenwith the brownies finishing the packing and Mrs. Santa Claus sewing buttons on the last dolls dress and tying the last hair ribbon and smoothing the last curl But everything was ready. The sleigh was packed from top to bottom so full that it seemed as if old Santa Claus could never squeeze in himself. There were tops and drums and Jackintheboxes and steam engines and hundreds of dolls and barrels of chocolate drops and peppermint canes were hanging out from the back. The reindeer were harnessed and prancingDasher and Dancer and Donner and Vixen and the rest. The sleighbells were ringing gaily and old Santa Claus jumped in and took the reins.Goodbye mother he called to Mrs. Santa Claus who stood in the door to watch the sleigh start. Anything I can bring you from the city dearI think I need a new pair of spectacles said Mrs. Santa Claus. My eyes are growing dim with so much sewing. If the stores are open when you finish tonight just bring me a stronger pair of glasses.I will. Goodbye shouted Santa Claus. With a dash and a jingle of bells the reindeer jumped to the top of the trees and started and Mrs. Santa Claus went in to sit in her rockingchair by the fire and doze.The workshop was very still. Christmas eve you know is the only time of the whole year when Santa Claus workmen may rest so the little brownies who paint the sleds and nail the doll houses and test the steamboats were curled up in heaps on all the benches fast asleep and snoring. The candykettles were polished and hung in a row upon the kitchen wall. Mrs. Santa Claus sat and rocked by the fire and thought of all the dolls she had dressed.There were four hundred with silk dresses she said to herself And two hundred with blue. There were five hundred baby dolls and I never finished dressing them until today. I wonder if Santa packed them all. I must go and see.So Mrs. Santa Claus lighted a candle and went out to the sewingroom and peered about in every corner. There were piles of silk and velvet and satin and ribbon all over the floor but ohthere sat three dolls a baby doll a doll in pink and a doll in blue Santa Claus had forgotten themWhat shall I do What shall I do cried Mrs. Santa Claus looking out of the window to see if Santa were anywhere in sightbut he was not. We counted them all and there were just enough to go around. Three little girls will have no dolls on Christmas morning. I shall have to go with them myselfOut in the barn there was just one reindeer standing in his stall. It was Blitzen who had a lame foot so he could not take the long journey with the others. He was contentedly munching hay but Mrs. Santa Claus tucked the dolls under her arm put on her little red shawl tied her cap strings tighter and hurried out to the barn.Come Blitzen she said as she saddled him and jumped on his back. We must go as fast as ever we can after Santa Claus. He has left three dolls behindSo Blitzen dropped his hay and they started. Over the woods and the fields and the fences they dashed so fast that the wind was left far behind. They looked very funny indeed for Mrs. Santa Claus had forgotten to take off her apron and her cap was all awry but on they hurried. And when they came to the towns Blitzen stopped at every roof that Mrs. Santa Claus might look down the chimney but Santa Claus had always been there first and the stockings were filled and the dolls were waiting.We counted them all Mrs. Santa Claus kept saying to herself. Some one will need a doll And sure enough she came to a very wee chimney of a very wee house and there was a stocking hung but there was only an apple in itnothing else. So Mrs. Santa Claus dropped the beautiful doll that was dressed in pink silk into the stocking and started on once more.Presently they came to another house and when Mrs. Santa Claus looked down the chimney she saw no stocking at all hanging by the fireplace and there was no fire even. There was nothing in the room but a table and a broken chair and a bed where a little girlso thin and palelay sleeping. And Mrs. Santa Claus dropped the doll in the blue silk dress right down into the little girls arms and hurried on again.When they had come to the very end of the town Mrs. Santa Claus saw a little girl standing out in the street. She had a bundle of papers to sell and no one had seen her because she was so small and she was waiting out in the cold and the snow. Mrs. Santa Claus dropped the baby doll down to the little girls lap and then she turned Blitzen toward home again.It was almost Christmas morning when they reached the barn and oh they were very tired. When Santa Claus came back with his empty sleigh and the new spectacles he found Mrs. Santa Claus fast asleep in her rockingchair by the fire.Poor mother he said shes been sewing too muchAnd Mrs. Santa Claus woke up but she never told about the three dolls.
Lean Lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy Harry and fat Trina who never let anything disturb their peace. She scoured everything with ashes from morning till evening and burdened her husband Long Laurence with so much work that he had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks. It was however all to no purpose they had nothing and came to nothing. One night as she lay in bed and could hardly move one limb for weariness she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep. She thrust her elbows into her husbands side and said Listen Lenz to what I have been thinking if I were to find one florin and one was given to me I would borrow another to put to them and thou too shouldst give me another and then as soon as I had got the four florins together I would buy a young cow. This pleased the husband right well. It is true said he that I do not know where I am to get the florin which thou wantest as a gift from me but if thou canst get the money together and canst buy a cow with it thou wilt do well to carry out thy project. I shall be glad he added if the cow has a calf and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me. The milk is not for thee said the woman we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat and we may be able to sell it well. Certainly replied the man but still we will take a little milk that will do no harm. Who has taught thee to manage cows said the woman Whether it does harm or not I will not allow it and even if thou wert to stand on thy head for it thou shouldst not have a drop of the milk Dost thou think because there is no satisfying thee Long Laurence that thou art to eat up what I earn with so much difficulty Wife said the man be quiet or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth What cried she thou threatenest me thou glutton thou rascal thou lazy Harry She was just laying hold of his hair but long Laurence got up seized both Lean Lisas withered arms in one hand and with the other he pressed down her head into the pillow let her scold and held her until she fell asleep for very weariness. Whether she continued to wrangle when she awoke next morning or whether she went out to look for the florin which she wanted to find that I know not.
Odin the Allfather sat one day on his high airthrone and looking around him far and wide saw three fierce monsters. They were the children of the mischievous firegod Loki and Odin began to feel anxious for they had grown so fast and were getting so strong that he feared they might do harm to the sacred city of Asgard. The wise father knew Loki had given strength to these dreadful creatures and he saw that all this danger had come upon the sir from Lokis wickedness.One of these monsters was a huge serpent that Odin sent down into the ocean where he grew so fast that his body was coiled around the whole world and his tail grew into his own mouth. He was called the Midgard serpent.The second monster was sent to Niflheim the home of darkness and shut up there.Note Listen to this Norse Mythology tale plus other Asgard Stories audiobooks on the Fairytalez Audio App for Apple and Android devicesThe third a fierce wolf named Fenrir was brought to Asgard where Odin hoped he might be tamed by living among the sir and seeing their good deeds and hearing their kind words but he grew more and more fierce until only one of all the gods dared to feed him. This was the brave god Tyr. He was a wargod like Thor and is sometimes called the Swordgod. Tyr was loved by all because he was so true and faithful.Each day the dreadful wolf grew larger and stronger till all at once before the sir thought about it he had become a very dangerous beast.Father Odin always looked troubled when he saw Fenrir the wolf come to get his evening meal of meat from Tyrs hand and at last one night after the wolf had gone growling away to his lair Odin called a meeting of the sir. He told them of his fears saying they must find some plan for guarding themselves and their home against this monster. They could not slay him for no one must ever be killed and no blood must be shed within the walls of the sacred city.Thor was the first to speak Do not fear Father Odin for by tomorrow night we shall have Fenrir so safely bound that he cannot do us any harm. I will make a mighty chain with the help of my hammer Milnir and with it we will bind him fastWhen the sir heard these words of Thor they were glad and all went home rejoicingall save the Allfather who was still troubled for he well knew the danger and feared that even the mighty Thor would find this task too much for him. But Thor seized his hammer and strode off to his forge. There he worked the whole night long and all through Asgard were heard the blows of Milnir and the roaring of the bellows.The next night when the sir were gathered together Thor brought forth his newmade chain to test it. In came Fenrir the wolf and every one was surprised to see how willingly he let himself be bound with the chain. When Thor had riveted the last links together the gods smiled and began to praise him for his wonderful work but all at once the wolf gave one bound forward broke the great chain and walked off to his lair as if nothing had happened.Thor was much disappointed still he did not lose courage. He said to the sir that he would make another chain yet stronger. Again he set to work and for three nights and three days the great Thor worked at his forge without resting.While he worked his friends did not forget him. They came and looked on while he was busy and as they watched the mighty hammer falling with quick blows upon the metal they talked to Thor or sang noble songs to cheer him sometimes they brought him food and drink. One visitor who was no friend fierce Fenrir the wolf sometimes put his nose in at the door for a moment and watched Thor at work then as he went away Thor heard a strange sound like a wicked laugh.At last the chain was finished and Thor dragged it to the place of meeting. It was so heavy that even the mighty Thor could hardly lift it or drag it as far as Odins palace of Gladsheim. This time Fenrir was not so willing to be bound but the gods coaxed him and talked of his great strength and told him they were sure he would easily break this chain also. After a while he agreed to let them put it around his neck.This time Thor was sure the chain would hold firm for never before had such a strong one been made. But soon with a great shake and a fierce bound the wolf broke away and went off to his lair snarling and showing his wicked teeth while the broken chain lay on the ground.Sadly the sir came together that night in Odins palace and this time Thor was not the first to speak he sat apart and was silent.First spoke Frey the god of summer and king of the fairies. Hearken to me O lords of Asgard he said. I have not won a brave name in battle like the noble Tyr neither have I done such mighty deeds as the great Thor and others of our heroes. Instead of fighting giants and monsters I have spent most of my life in the woods among the flowers listening for hours to the birds. Many things have I watched some perhaps that my brothers thought too small to be worthy of notice. I have learned many lessons and the greatest of them all is to know how much power there is in little things and to see how often the work done quietly and hidden from the eyes of men is the finest and the most wonderful. Since we cannot make a chain strong enough to bind Fenrir let us go to the little dwarfs who work in silence and in darkness and ask them to make us a chainThe Allfathers troubled face grew brighter as he heard Frey speak and he bade him send a messenger quickly to the dwarfs to order a chain made as soon as possible.So Frey went out leaving the sir in their trouble and came to his own lovely home Alfheim. There everything was bright and peaceful and the little elves were busy and happy. Frey found a trusty messenger and sent him with all speed to the dwarfs underground to order the new chain and to return as soon as he could bring it. The faithful servant found the funny little dwarf workmen all busy in their dark rock chambers far down inside the earth while at one side in a lighter place sat their king. The messenger bowed before him and told him his errand.The dwarfs were a wicked race but they were afraid of Odin for they had not forgotten the talk he once had with them when he sent them down to work in darkness underground and since that time they never had dared disobey him. The dwarf king said it would take two days and two nights to make the chain but it would be so strong that no one could break it.While the busy dwarfs were at work the messenger looked about at the many wonderful things the great central fire which burns always in the middle of the earth watched and fed with coal by the dwarfs above this the beds of coal and bright precious diamonds which the dwarfs took from the ashes of the fire. In another place he watched them putting gold and silver tin and copper into the cracks in the rocks and he drank of the pure underground water which gives the Midgard people fresh springs.After two days this messenger returned to the dwarf king. The king holding out in his hand a fine small chain said to the messenger This may seem to you to be small and weak but it is a most wonderful piece of work for we have used in it all the strongest stuff we could find. It is made of six kinds of things the noise made by the footfall of cats the roots of stones the beards of women the voice of fishes the spittle of birds the sinews of bears. This chain can never be broken and if you can once put it on Fenrir he will never be able to throw it off.Odins messenger was glad to hear this so he thanked the dwarf king and promising him a large reward he went on his way back to Asgard where the sir were longing for his return and were all rejoiced to see him with the magic chain.Now Father Odin feared that Fenrir would not let them bind him a third time so he proposed they should all take a holiday and go out to a beautiful lake to the north of Asgard where they would have games and trials of strength. The other gods were pleased with this plan and all set out in Freys wonderful ship which was large enough to hold all the sir with their horses and yet could be folded up small enough to go in ones pocket.They landed on a lovely island in the lake and after the races and games were over Frey brought out the little chain and asked them all to try to break it. Thor and Tyr tried in vain then Thor said I do not believe any one but Fenrir can break it.Now the wolf did not want to be bound again but he was very proud of his strength and for fear of being called a coward said at last he would let them do it if he might hold the right hand of one of the sir in his mouth while they bound him as a sign that the gods did not mean to play any tricks.When the gods heard this they looked at each other and all but one of them drew back. Only the brave good Tyr stepping forward quietly put his hand into Fenrirs mouth. The other gods then put the chain around the beast and fastened it to a great rock. The fierce creature gave a leap to free himself but the more he struggled the tighter grew the chain. The sir gathered about him in joy to see this but their hearts were filled with sorrow when they saw that their noble Tyr had lost his right hand the dreadful wolf had shut his teeth together in his rage when he found he could not get free.Thus the brave Tyr dared to risk danger for the sake of saving others and gave up even his right hand to gain peace and happiness for Asgard.
Frey chief of the Vanir longed to have sight of his sister who had been from Asgard for so long. You must know that this happened during the time when Freya was wandering through the world seeking her husband the lost Odur. Now there was in Asgard a place from which one could overlook the world and have a glimpse of all who wandered there. That place was Hlidskjalf Odins lofty WatchTower.High up into the blue of the air that Tower went. Frey came to it and he knew that Odin AllFather was not upon Hlidskjalf. Only the two wolves Geri and Freki that crouched beside Odins seat at the banquet were there and they stood in the way of Freys entrance to the Tower. But Frey spoke to Geri and Freki in the language of the Gods and Odins wolves had to let him pass.But as he went up the steps within the Tower Frey chief of the Vanir knew that he was doing a fateful thing. For none of the High Gods not even Thor the Defender of Asgard nor Baldur the BestBeloved of the Gods had ever climbed to the top of that Tower and seated themselves upon the AllFathers seat. But if I could see my sister once I should be contented said Frey to himself and no harm can come to me if I look out on the world.He came to the top of Hlidskjalf. He seated himself on Odins lofty seat. He looked out on the world. He saw Midgard the World of Men with its houses and towns its farms and people. Beyond Midgard he saw Jtunheim the Realm of the Giants terrible with its dark mountains and its masses of snow and ice. He saw Freya as she went upon her wanderings and he marked that her face was turned toward Asgard and that her steps were leading toward the City of the Gods. I have contented myself by looking from Hlidskjalf said Frey to himself and no harm has come to me.But even as he spoke his gaze was drawn to a dwelling that stood in the middle of the ice and snow of Jtunheim. Long he gazed upon that dwelling without knowing why he looked that way. Then the door of the house was opened and a Giant maiden stood within the doorway. Frey gazed and gazed on her. So great was the beauty of her face that it was like starlight in that dark land. She looked from the doorway of the house and then turned and went within shutting the door.Frey sat on Odins high seat for long. Then he went down the steps of the Tower and passed by the two wolves Geri and Freki that looked threateningly upon him. He went through Asgard but he found no one to please him in the City of the Gods. That night sleep did not come to him for his thoughts were fixed upon the loveliness of the Giant maid he had looked upon. And when morning came he was filled with loneliness because he thought himself so far from her. He went to Hlidskjalf again thinking to climb the Tower and have sight of her once more. But now the two wolves Geri and Freki bared their teeth at him and would not let him pass although he spoke to them again in the language of the Gods.He went and spoke to wise Nird his father. She whom you have seen my son said Nird is Gerda the daughter of the Giant Gymer. You must give over thinking of her. Your love for her would be an ill thing for you.Why should it be an ill thing for me Frey asked.Because you would have to give that which you prize most for the sake of coming to her.That which I prize most said Frey is my magic sword.You will have to give your magic sword said his father the wise Nird.I will give it said Frey loosening his magic sword from his belt.Bethink thee my son said Nird. If thou givest thy sword what weapon wilt thou have on the day of Ragnark when the Giants will make war upon the GodsFrey did not speak but he thought the day of Ragnark was far off. I cannot live without Gerda he said as he turned away.There was one in Asgard who was called Skirnir. He was a venturesome being who never cared what he said or did. To no one else but Skirnir could Frey bring himself to tell of the trouble that had fallen on himthe trouble that was the punishment for his placing himself on the seat of the AllFather.Skirnir laughed when he heard Freys tale. Thou a Van in love with a maid of Jtunheim This is fun indeed Will ye make a marriage of itWould that I might even speak to her or send a message of love to her said Frey. But I may not leave my watch over the Elves.And if I should take a message to Gerda said Skirnir the Venturesome what would my reward beMy boat Skidbladnir or my boar Golden Bristle said Frey.No no said Skirnir. I want something to go by my side. I want something to use in my hand. Give me the magic sword you own.Frey thought upon what his father said that he would be left weaponless on the day of Ragnark when the Giants would make war upon the Gods and when Asgard would be endangered. He thought upon this and drew back from Skirnir and for a while he remained in thought. And all the time thickset Skirnir was laughing at him out of his wide mouth and his blue eyes. Then Frey said to himself The day of Ragnark is far off and I cannot live without Gerda.He drew the magic sword from his belt and he placed it in Skirnirs hand. I give you my sword Skirnir he said. Take my message to Gerda Gymers daughter. Show her this gold and these precious jewels and say I love her and that I claim her love.I shall bring the maid to you said Skirnir the Venturesome.But how wilt thou get to Jtunheim said Frey suddenly remembering how dark the Giants land was and how terrible were the approaches to it.Oh with a good horse and a good sword one can get anywhere said Skirnir. My horse is a mighty horse and you have given me your sword of magic. Tomorrow I shall make the journey.Skirnir rode across Bifrst the Rainbow Bridge laughing out of his wide mouth and his blue eyes at Heimdall the Warder of the Bridge to Asgard. His mighty horse trod the earth of Midgard and swam the river that divides Midgard the World of Men from Jtunheim the Realm of the Giants. He rode on heedlessly and recklessly as he did all things. Then out of the iron forests came the monstrous wolves of Jtunheim to tear and devour him and his mighty horse. It was well for Skirnir that he had in his belt Freys magic sword. Its edge slew and its gleam frighted the monstrous beasts. On and on Skirnir rode on his mighty horse. Then he came to a wall of fire. No other horse but his mighty horse could go through it. Skirnir rode through the fire and came to the dale in which was Gymers dwelling.And now he was before the house that Frey had seen Gerda enter on the day when he had climbed Hlidskjalf Odins WatchTower. The mighty hounds that guarded Gymers dwelling came and bayed around him. But the gleam of the magic sword kept them away. Skirnir backed his horse to the door and made his horses hooves strike against it.Gymer was in the feast hall drinking with his Giant friends and he did not hear the baying of the hounds nor the clatter that Skirnir made before the door. But Gerda sat spinning with her maidens in the hall. Who comes to Gymers door she said.A warrior upon a mighty horse said one of the maidens.Even though he be an enemy and one who slew my brother yet shall we open the door to him and give him a cup of Gymers mead said Gerda.One of the maidens opened the door and Skirnir entered Gymers dwelling. He knew Gerda amongst her maidens. He went to her and showed her the rich gold and the precious jewels that he had brought from Frey. These are for you fairest Gerda he said if you will give your love to Frey the Chief of the Vanir.Show your gold and jewels to other maidens said Gerda. Gold and jewels will never bring me to give my love.Then Skirnir the Venturesome the heedless of his words drew the magic sword from his belt and held it above her. Give your love to Frey who has given me this sword he said or meet your death by the edge of it.Gerda Gymers daughter only laughed at the reckless Skirnir Make the daughters of men fearful by the sharpness of Freys sword she said but do not try to frighten a Giants daughter with it.Then Skirnir the Reckless the heedless of his words made the magic sword flash before her eyes while he cried out in a terrible voice saying a spell over herGerda I will curse theeYes with this magicBlade I shall touch theeSuch is its powerThat like a thistleWithered twill leave theeLike a thistle the windStrips from the roof.Hearing these terrible words and the strange hissings of the magic sword Gerda threw herself on the ground crying out for pity. But Skirnir stood above her and the magic sword flashed and hissed over her. Skirnir sangMore ugly Ill leave theeThan maid ever wasThou wilt be mocked atBy men and by GiantsA Dwarf only will wed theeNow on this instantWith this blade I shall touch theeAnd leave thee bespelled.She lifted herself on her knees and cried out to Skirnir to spare her from the spell of the magic sword.Only if thou wilt give thy love to Frey said Skirnir.I will give my love to him said Gerda. Now put up thy magic sword and drink a cup of mead and depart from Gymers dwelling.I will not drink a cup of your mead nor shall I depart from Gymers dwelling until you yourself say that you will meet and speak with Frey.I will meet and speak with him said Gerda.When will you meet and speak with him asked Skirnir.In the wood of Barri nine nights from this. Let him come and meet me there.Then Skirnir put up his magic sword and drank the cup of mead that Gerda gave him. He rode from Gymers house laughing aloud at having won Gerda for Frey and so making the magic sword his own for ever.Skirnir the Venturesome the heedless of his words riding across Bifrst on his mighty horse found Frey standing waiting for him beside Heimdall the Warder of the Bridge to Asgard.What news dost thou bring me cried Frey. Speak Skirnir before thou dost dismount from thine horse.In nine nights from this thou mayst meet Gerda in Barri Wood said Skirnir. He looked at him laughing out of his wide mouth and his blue eyes. But Frey turned away saying to himselfLong is one dayLong long two.Can I live throughNine long daysLong indeed were these days for Frey. But the ninth day came and in the evening Frey went to Barri Wood. And there he met Gerda the Giant maid. She was as fair as when he had seen her before the door of Gymers house. And when she saw Frey so tall and noble looking the Giants daughter was glad that Skirnir the Venturesome had made her promise to come to Barri Wood. They gave each other rings of gold. It was settled that the Giant maid should come as a bride to Asgard.Gerda came but another Giant maid came also. This is how that came to beAll the Dwellers in Asgard were standing before the great gate waiting to welcome the bride of Frey. There appeared a Giant maid who was not Gerda all in armor was she.I am Skadi she said the daughter of Thiassi. My father met his death at the hands of the Dwellers in Asgard. I claim a recompense.What recompense would you have maiden asked Odin smiling to see a Giant maid standing so boldly in Asgard.A husband from amongst you even as Gerda. And I myself must be let choose him.All laughed aloud at the words of Skadi. Then said Odin laughing We will let you choose a husband from amongst us but you must choose him by his feet.I will choose him whatever way you will said Skadi fixing her eyes on Baldur the most beautiful of all the Dwellers in Asgard.They put a bandage round her eyes and the sir and the Vanir seat in a half circle around. As she went by she stooped over each and laid hands upon their feet. At last she came to one whose feet were so finely formed that she felt sure it was Baldur. She stood up and saidThis is the one that Skadi chooses for her husband.Then the sir and the Vanir laughed more and more. They took the bandage off her eyes and she saw not Baldur the Beautiful but Nird the father of Frey. But as Skadi looked more and more on Nird she became more and more contented with her choice for Nird was strong and he was noble looking.These two Nird and Skadi went first to live in Nirds palace by the sea but the coming of the sea mew would waken Skadi too early in the morning and she drew her husband to the mountaintop where she was more at home. He would not live long away from the sound of the sea. Back and forward between the mountain and the sea Skadi and Nird went. But Gerda stayed in Asgard with Frey her husband and the sir and the Vanir came to love greatly Gerda the Giant maid.
Long long ago before there was a moon in the sky there lived two beautiful maidens who loved each other dearly. One was called by a name that meant ShiningEyes and the other by a name that meant RipplingHair.ShiningEyes had heard a great deal about the Firethatnevergoesout. She often talked to RipplingHair about it. It is kept in one of the underworlds she said. Fierce spirits guard it day and night. If we could bring it away we should obtain the Lifethatneverdies. Think of it. Unending Life What a gift that would be to the worldOne day she said Will you come with me to look for itThe journey is too dangerous cried Rippling Hair. Besides there are those terrible spirits We should never return alive.Wait I have a plan said ShiningEyes. We might take a basket of kumaras to the spirits. While they eat the sweet earthfruits we can snatch away a firestick and run off with it.But they would catch us.I think not. We are both swift runners and we should have a good start.Our fathers may not let us go.We need not say where we are going nor mention the dangers of the journey. It will be enough to say that we wish to take a little trip together.RipplingHair still looked doubtful but Shining Eyes took her hands and looked into her eyes.  I am going dear friend she said. I have thought of it night and day until I must go. I cannot give it up. But youdo not come if your heart fails you. I do not wish to lead you into danger.Where you go I shall goyou know that cried RipplingHair.Then come with me to find the Firethatnevergoesout laughed ShiningEyes for that is where I am going.I will come said RipplingHair though she trembled at the thought. Afterwards when the real dangers came she forgot her fears and went through everything as bravely as Shining Eyes herself.They obtained the consent of their parents to leave home made all their arrangements as if for a short visit to a neighbouring village and started off taking with them food for themselves on the way and a basket of kumaras for the spirits. At first the track was pleasant enough. It led over a sunny plain and past a gentlyflowing river. But when they came to the dark bush lands their troubles began. Every tree and bramble every bird and insect in the bush knew why ShiningEyes and RipplingHair were travelling north and they all tried to turn them back from the death they risked.The tall trees interlocked their boughs to shut out the sun and make the pathway dark. You will lose your way. Turn back before it is too late they sighed. And many times the two girls lost their way.Turn back before it is too late said the brambles the thorny waitabits. They caught the friends holding them with their curved claws and tearing their hands and faces till they bled.Turn back before it is too late piped the birds and insects. They stole what food they could when the maidens were not watching so that hunger should drive them back to safety.But ShiningEyes and RipplingHair would not be turned back. Although after many days their sufferings had weakened them so sorely that they fell at the foot of a great treefern and could not rise they did not lose heart. All their food was gone except the basket of kumaras for the spirits they were footsore and numb with weariness but they said We shall sleep and wake up strengthened. We must not will not give in.From among the fronds of the treefern peeped the kindly faces of watching forest fairies. They heard the brave words and saw the wornout girls drop off to sleep. Let us help them said one. The bush has done its best to stop them but they will not be stopped. Perhaps their courage will carry them safely to their journeys end.They trooped down from the treefern carried the sleepers to the fairy palace and laid them on beds of softest down to dream the night away. In the morning they brought magic foods and drinks that took away all pain and weariness.The two girls strong and well once more went on their way with grateful happy hearts. Leaving the bush behind they came into the mountainland. The mountains put forth all their terrors to turn them back from death. Little hills raised themselves into mountains to tire their feet mountains stretched themselves almost to the sky. The girls went on as if nothing had happened  the hills and mountains seeing this fell back again to their old size and the girls climbed over them with ease. Sometimes great rocks sprang suddenly into their path deep clefts opened before their feet mountain storms roared about their heads  once a mountain giant chased them.But they neither faltered nor turned back and at last the mountains said Leave them alone. Their courage will carry them safely through to their purpose.They came at last to the end of the land. Below them lay the sea above them towered a beautiful tree with crimson flowers. They stood on the edge of the cliff and looked at the twisted roots that led from the tree down the face of the rock to the beach below.The tree is called SpraySprinkled said ShiningEyes.  Between its lowest roots lies the opening to the underworld. To that higher point above us come each night the souls of those who have died during the day. There they pause once to sigh then fling themselves below to enter that dark underworld. If we can save our friends from death and this sad end our sufferings on the way have been worth while.Through the night they rested. When the morning broke they descended by the roots and found the opening to the underworld. A narrow passage dark as night led into the earth. Trembling they entered in groping their slow way with beating hearts. After a long time a gleam of light shone out in front. They walked faster. Coming to the end of the passage they peeped out. Before them lay a wide open plain lit by a fire made of three sticks crossed. In front of the fire sat three fierce old spirits. The Firethatnevergoesout  whispered ShiningEyes. Give me the kumaras.Silently as they could the girls approached the fire. But the spirits heard their steps. Mortals they shrieked starting up in anger.ShiningEyes held out the basket of kumaras. See she said  we have brought you these earthfruits. You have none so sweet down here.Astonished at her boldness the spirits took the kumaras and crowded round to taste them. Stooping ShiningEyes snatched a firestick from the ground and flew with RipplingHair towards the entrance to the passage. They had almost reached the entrance when screams of rage behind them told them that their trick was discovered. Quick oh quick breathed ShiningEyes.Up the long passage now lit by the flaming stick they fled with desperate swiftness. Behind them came the spirits gaining on them with every step. If only we can keep the lead till we reach the opening panted RipplingHair in front. Ah here it is. We are saved.She sprang through the opening turned and grasped her friends hand to pull her through. But at that moment one of the spirits reached ShiningEyes and seized her heel. I am held gasped ShiningEyes.She struggled wildly while RipplingHair pulled with all her strength. They could not free her heel. Drop the firestick and give me both hands RipplingHair whispered.  Drop it or you will be pulled back and that means death. I will not lose it. It is unending life cried ShiningEyes. With one tremendous effort she hurled it far into the sky.Seizing the freed hand RipplingHair jerked her friend out of the spirits grasp on to the sandy beach above the opening. The spirits dared not come above the ground. They fled back through the passage screaming with rage at the loss of their cherished stick.The girls lay panting on the beach their eyes directed to the flaming stick. From where ShiningEyes had flung it it whirled higher and yet higher faster and faster until it whirled itself into a ball. Rangi looked down and saw it coming. He put out his hand and caught it and fitted it into a niche in the sky. Calling the North Wind he gave him a message for the girls.Tell them he said that unending life is not for the people of the earth. But tell them also that their brave deed is not lost for the Fire thatnevergoesout shall stay in the sky to give light when the sun is away. Through it I can look down upon the Earthmother at night by its light men shall see to walk when otherwise it would be dark. Let the maidens return to their homes knowing that for ever men will bless them for the good deed they have done.The girls listened to the message and were comforted for the loss of the stick. They retraced their steps arriving home in safety to relate their doings to their friends. astonished but they saw the new great light in the sky so they believed the girls and loved them for their noble courage. And the great light still shines on in the sky. Men call it the Moon.
In the old days when men were allowed to have many wives a middleaged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young each loved him very much and desired to see him like herself. Now the Mans hair was turning grey which the young Wife did not like as it made him look too old for her husband. So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones. But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother. So every morning she used to Arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could. The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald. Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.
Before Pittsburg had become worthy to be called a settlement a white man rowed his boat to the mouth of Chartiers creek near that present city. He was seeking a place in which to make his home and a little way upstream where were timber water and a southern slope he marked a tomahawk claim and set about clearing the land. Next year his wife two children and his brother came to occupy the cabin he had built and for a long time all went happily but on returning from a long hunt the brothers found the little house in ashes and the charred remains of its occupants in the ruins. Though nearly crazed by this catastrophe they knew that their own lives were in hourly peril and they wished to live until they could punish the savages for this crime. After burying the bodies they started east across the hills leaving a letter on birch bark in a cleft stick at the mouth of Chartiers creek in which the tragedy was recounted.This letter was afterward found by trappers. The men themselves were never heard from and it is believed that they too fell at the hands of the Indians. Old settlers used to affirm that on summer nights the cries of the murdered innocents could be heard in the little valley where the cabin stood and when storms were coming up these cries were often blended with the yells of savages. More impressive are the death lightsthe willothewispsthat wander over the scene of the tragedy and up and down the neighboring slopes. These apparitions are said to be the spirits of husband and wife seeking each other or going together in search of their children but some declare that in their upward streaming rays it can readily be seen that they are the scalps of the slain. Two of them have a golden hue and these are the scalps of the children. From beneath them drops of red seem to distil on the grass and are found to have bedewed the flowers on the following morning.
My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire and I was the third of four sons. He sent me to Cambridge at fourteen years old and after studying there three years I was bound apprentice to Mr. Bates a famous surgeon in London. There as my father now and then sent me small sums of money I spent them in learning navigation and other arts useful to those who travel as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do.Three years after my leaving him my good master Mr. Bates recommended me as ships surgeon to the Swallow on which I voyaged three years. When I came back I settled in London and having taken part of a small house I married Miss Mary Burton daughter of Mr. Edmund Burton hosier.But my good master Bates died two years after and as I had few friends my business began to fail and I determined to go again to sea. After several voyages I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard master of the Antelope who was making a voyage to the South Sea. We set sail from Bristol May 4 1699 and our voyage at first was very prosperous.But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemens Land. Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food and the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November the weather being very hazy the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it and immediately split. Six of the crew of whom I was one letting down the boat got clear of the ship and we rowed about three leagues till we could work no longer. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall. What became of my companions in the boat or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel I cannot tell but I conclude they were all lost. For my part I swam as fortune directed me and was pushed forward by wind and tide but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth. By this time the storm was much abated. I reached the shore at last about eight oclock in the evening and advanced nearly half a mile inland but could not discover any sign of inhabitants. I was extremely tired and with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass which was very short and soft and slept sounder than ever I did in my life for about nine hours. When I woke it was just daylight. I attempted to rise but could not for as I happened to be lying on my back I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner. I could only look upward. The sun began to grow hot and the light hurt my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me but could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg which advancing gently over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyes downward I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However they soon returned and one of them who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifted up his hands in admiration. I lay all this while in great uneasiness but at length struggling to get loose I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground and at the same time with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them whereupon there was a great shout and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me like so many needles. Moreover they shot another flight into the air of which some fell on my face which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain and then striving again to get loose they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first and some of them tried to stab me with their spears but by good luck I had on a leather jacket which they could not pierce. By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night when my left hand being already loose I could easily free myself and as for the inhabitants I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw. When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased and about four yards from me for more than an hour there was a knocking like people at work. Then turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me I saw a stage set up about a foot and a half from the ground with two or three ladders to mount it. From this one of them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech of which I could not understand a word though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness. I answered in few words but in the most submissive manner and being almost famished with hunger I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth to signify that I wanted food. He understood me very well and descending from the stage commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food which had been sent by the Kings orders when he first received tidings of me. There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them two or three at a mouthful and took three loaves at a time. They supplied me as fast as they could with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite. I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink. They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me and being a most ingenious people they slung up one of their largest hogsheads then rolled it toward my hand and beat out the top. I drank it off at a draught which I might well do for it did not hold half a pint. They brought me a second hogshead which I drank and made signs for more but they had none to give me. However I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals who ventured to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands was free without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them. After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency having mounted my right leg advanced to my face with about a dozen of his retinue and spoke about ten minutes often pointing forward which as I afterward found was toward the capital city about half a mile distant whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed. I made a sign with my hand that was loose putting it to the other but over his Excellencys head for fear of hurting him or his train to show that I desired my liberty. He seemed to understand me well enough for he shook his head though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment. Then I once more thought of attempting to escape but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweetsmelling ointment which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows. The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy and presently I fell asleep. I slept about eight hours as I was told afterward and it was no wonder for the physicians by the Emperors orders had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine.It seems that when I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing the Emperor had early notice of it and determined that I should be tied in the manner I have related which was done in the night while I slept that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city. Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine. It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upon twentytwo wheels. But the difficulty was to place me on it. Eighty poles were erected for this purpose and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen had tied round my neck hands body and legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles and in less than three hours I was raised and slung into the engine and there tied fast. Fifteen hundred of the Emperors largest horses each about four inches and a half high were then employed to draw me toward the capital. But while all this was done I still lay in a deep sleep and I did not wake till four hours after we began our journey.The Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the capital but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body. Where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom and here it was determined that I should lodge. Near the great gate through which I could easily creep they fixed ninetyone chains like those which hang to a ladys watch which were locked to my left leg with thirtysix padlocks and when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut all the strings that bound me. Then I rose up feeling as melancholy as ever I did in my life. But the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple. The Emperor advancing toward me from among his courtiers all most magnificently clad surveyed me with great admiration but kept beyond the length of my chain. He was taller by about the breadth of my nail than any of his Court which alone was enough to strike awe into the beholders and graceful and majestic. The better to behold him I lay down on my side so that my face was level with his and he stood three yards off. However I have had him since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived. His dress was very simple but he wore a light helmet of gold adorned with jewels and a plume. He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if I should break loose it was almost three inches long and the hilt was of gold enriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill but very clear. His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me and I answered but neither of us could understand a word.After about two hours the Court retired and I was left with a strong guard to keep away the crowd some of whom had had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as I sat by the door of my house. But the colonel ordered six of them to be seized and delivered bound into my hands. I put five of them into my coat pocket and as to the sixth I made a face as if I would eat him alive. The poor man screamed terribly and the colonel and his officers were much distressed especially when they saw me take out my penknife. But I soon set them at ease for cutting the strings he was bound with I put him gently on the ground and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and I saw that both the soldiers and people were delighted at this mark of my kindnessToward night I got with some difficulty into my house where I lay on the ground as I had to do for a fortnight till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure.Six hundred servants were appointed me and three hundred tailors made me a suit of clothes. Moreover six of his Majestys greatest scholars were employed to teach me their language so that soon I was able to converse after a fashion with the Emperor who often honored me with his visits. The first words I learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty which I every day repeated on my knees but he answered that this must be a work of time and that first I must swear a peace with him and his kingdom. He told me also that by the laws of the nation I must be searched by two of his officers and that as this could not be done without my help he trusted them in my hands and whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country. I took up the two officers and put them into my coat pockets. These gentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exact list of everything they saw which I afterward translated into English and which ran as followsIn the right coat pocket of the great ManMountain we found only one great piece of coarse cloth large enough to cover the carpet of your Majestys chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a silver cover which we could not lift. We desired that it should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the midleg in a sort of dust some of which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing. In his right waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances folded one over another about the size of three men tied with a strong cable and marked with black figures which we humbly conceive to be writings. In the left there was a sort of engine from the back of which extended twenty long poles with which we conjecture the ManMountain combs his head. In the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal of different sizes. Some of the white which appeared to be silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. From another pocket hung a huge silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shin ing substance. This engine made an incessant noise like a watermill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal or the god he worships but probably the latter for he told us that he seldom did anything without consulting it.This is a list of what we found about the body of the ManMountain who treated us with great civility.I had one private pocket which escaped their search containing a pair of spectacles and a small spyglass which being of no consequence to the Emperor I did not think myself bound in honor to discover.CHAPTER IIIMy gentleness and good behavior gained so far on the Emperor and his Court and indeed on the people in general that I began to have hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. The natives came by degrees to be less fearful of danger from me. I would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and at last the boys and girls ventured to come and play at hide andseek in my hair.The horses of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy having been daily led before me and one of the Emperor s huntsmen on a large courser took my foot shoe and all which was indeed a prodigious leap. I amused the Emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner. I took nine sticks and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square. Then I took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each corner about two feet from the ground. I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum and I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best horse twentyfour in number come and exercise upon this plain. His majesty approved of the proposal and I took them up one by one with the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties discharged blunt arrows drew their swords fled and pursued and in short showed the best military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage and the Emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days and persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within two yards of the stage whence she could view the whole performance. Fortunately no accident happened only once a fiery horse pawing with his hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and overthrew his rider and himself. But I immediately relieved them both and covering the hole with one hand I set down the troop with the other as I had taken them up. The horse that fell was strained in the shoulder but the rider was not hurt and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could. However I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises.I had sent so many petitions for my liberty that his Majesty at length mentioned the matter in a full council where it was opposed by none except Skyresh Bolgolam admiral of the realm who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy. However he agreed at length though he succeeded in himself drawing up the conditions on which I should be set free. After they were read I was requested to swear to perform them in the method prescribed by their laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and my thumb on the top of my right ear. But I have made a translation of the conditions which I here offer to the publicGolbaste Mamarem Evlame Gurdile Shefin Mully Ully Gue Most Mighty Emperor of Lilliput delight and terror of the universe whose dominions extend to the ends of the globe monarch of all monarchs taller than the sons of men whose feet press down to the center and whose head strikes against the sun at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees pleasant as the spring comfortable as the summer fruitful as autumn dreadful as winter His Most Sublime Majesty proposeth to the ManMountain lately arrived at our celestial dominions the following articles which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to performFirst. The ManMountain shall not depart from our dominions without our license under the great seal.Second. He shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our express order at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours warning to keep within doors.Third. The said ManMountain shall confine his walks to our principal high roads and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn.Fourth. As he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects their horses or carriages nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own consent.Fifth. If an express requires extraordinary speed the ManMountain shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six days journey and return the said messenger if so required safe to our imperial presence.Sixth. He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of Blefuscu and do his utmost to destroy their fleet which is now preparing to invade us.Lastly. Upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles the said ManMountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects with free access to our royal person and other marks of our favor. Given at our palace at Belfaburac the twelfth day of the ninetyfirst moon of our reign.I swore to these articles with great cheerfulness whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked and I was at full liberty.One morning about a fortnight after I had obtained my freedom Reldresal the Emperors secretary for private affairs came to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to wait at a distance and desired that I would give him an hours audience. I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty but he added that save for the present state of things at Court perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For he said however flourishing we may seem to foreigners we are in danger of an invasion from the island of Blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universe almost as large and as powerful as this of his Majesty. For as to what we have heard you say that there are other kingdoms in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophers are very doubtful and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon or one of the stars because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his Majestys dominions. Besides our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two mighty empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu which as I was going to tell you are engaged in a most obstinate war which began in the following manner It is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs was upon the larger end but his present Majestys grandfather while he was a boy going to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practice happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the Emperor his father made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs. The people so highly resented this law that there have been six rebellions raised on that account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crown. It is calculated that eleven hundred persons have at different times suffered rather than break their eggs at the smaller end. But these rebels the Bigendians have found so much encouragement at the Emperor of Blefuscus Court to which they always fled for refuge that a bloody war as I said has been carried on between the two empires for sixandthirty moons and now the Blefuscudians have equipped a large fleet and are preparing to descend upon us. Therefore his Imperial Majesty placing great confidence in your valor and strength has commanded me to set the case before you.I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the Emperor and to let him know that I was ready at the risk of my life to defend him against all invaders.It was not long before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed for seizing the enemys whole fleet. The Empire of Blefuscu is an island parted from Lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide. I consulted the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel and they told me that in the middle at high water it was seventy glumguffs about six feet of European measure. I walked toward the coast where lying down behind a hillock I took out my spyglass and viewed the enemys fleet at anchorabout fifty menofwar and other vessels. I then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knittingneedle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together bending the ends into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables I went back to the coast and taking off my coat shoes and stockings walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could swimming in the middle about thirty yards till I felt ground and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand. Then fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship I tied all the cords together at the end. Meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face. My greatest fear was for my eyes which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperors searchers. These I took out and fastened upon my nose and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them. Then taking the knot in my hand I began to pull but not a ship would stir for they were too fast held by their anchors. Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained. Letting go the cord I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands. Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largest menofwar after me.When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order and me pulling at the end they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe. When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival. I then took off my spectacles and after waiting about an hour till the tide was a little fallen I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput.The Emperor and his whole Court stood on the shore awaiting me. They saw the ships move forward in a large halfmoon but could not discern me who in the middle of the channel was under water up to my neck. The Emperor concluded that I was drowned and that the enemys fleet was approaching in a hostile manner. But he was soon set at ease for the channel growing shallower every step I made I came in a short time within hearing and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened I cried in a loud voice Long live the most puissant Emperor of Lilliput The Prince received me at my landing with all possible joy and made me a Nardal on the spot which is the highest title of honor among them.His Majesty desired that I would take some opportunity to bring all the rest of his enemys ships into his ports and seemed to think of nothing less than conquering the whole Empire of Blefuscu and becoming the sole monarch of the world. But I plainly protested that I would never be the means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery and though the wisest of the Ministers were of my opinion my open refusal was so opposed to his Majestys ambition that he could never forgive me. And from this time a plot began between himself and those of his Ministers who were my enemies that nearly ended in my utter destruction.About three weeks after this exploit there arrived an embassy from Blefuscu with humble offers of peace which was soon concluded on terms very advantageous to our Emperor. There were six ambassadors with a train of about five hundred persons all very magnificent. Having been privately told that I had befriended them they made me a visit and paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity invited me to their kingdom in the Emperor their masters name. I asked them to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country. Accordingly the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor I desired his general permission to visit the Blefuscudian monarch. This he granted me but in a very cold manner of which I afterward learned the reason.When I was just preparing to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu a distinguished person at Court to whom I had once done a great service came to my house very privately at night and without sending his name desired admission. I put his lordship into my coat pocket and giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one I fastened the door placed my visitor on the table and sat down by it. His lordships face was full of trouble and he asked me to hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life.You are aware he said that Skyresh Bolgolam has been your mortal enemy ever since your arrival and his hatred is increased since your great success against Blefuscu by which his glory as admiral is obscured. This lord and others have accused you of treason and several councils have been called in the most private manner on your account. Out of gratitude for your favors I procured information of the whole proceedings venturing my head for your service and this was the charge against youFirst that you having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port were commanded by his Majesty to seize all the other ships and put to death all the Bigendian exiles and also all the people of the empire who would not immediately consent to break their eggs at the smaller end. And that like a false traitor to his Most Serene Majesty you excused yourself from the service on pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences and destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people.Again when ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu like a false traitor you aided and entertained them though you knew them to be servants of a prince lately in open war against his Imperial Majesty.Moreover you are now preparing contrary to the duty of a faithful subject to voyage to the Court of Blefuscu.In the debate on this charge my friend continued his Majesty often urged the services you had done him while the admiral and treasurer insisted that you should be put to a shameful death. But Reldresal secretary for private affairs who has always proved himself your friend suggested that if his Majesty would please to spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes justice might in some measure be satisfied. At this Bolgolam rose up in fury wondering how the secretary dared desire to preserve the life of a traitor and the treasurer pointing out the expense of keeping you also urged your death. But his Majesty was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a punishment some other might afterward be inflicted. And the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again said that as to expense your allowance might be gradually lessened so that for want of sufficient food you should grow weak and faint and die in a few months when his Majestys subjects might cut your flesh from your bones and bury it leaving the skeleton for the admiration of posterity.Thus through the great friendship of the secretary the affair was arranged. It was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books. In three days your friend the secretary will come to your house and read the accusation before you and point out the great mercy of his Majesty that only condemns you to the loss of your eyeswhich he does not doubt you will submit to humbly and gratefully. Twenty of his Majestys surgeons will attend to see the operation well performed by discharging very sharppointed arrows into the balls of your eyes as you lie on the ground.I leave you said my friend to consider what measures you will take and to escape suspicion I must immediately return as secretly as I came.His lordship did so and I remained alone in great perplexity. At first I was bent on resistance for while I had liberty I could easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces but I soon rejected that idea with horror remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor and the favors I had received from him. At last having his Majestys leave to pay my respects to the Emperor of Ble fuscu I resolved to take this opportunity. Before the three days had passed I wrote a letter to my friend the secretary telling him of my resolution and without waiting for an answer went to the coast and entering the channel between wading and swimming reached the port of Blefuscu where the people who had long expected me led me to the capital.His Majesty with the royal family and great officers of the Court came out to receive me and they entertained me in a manner suited to the generosity of so great a prince. I did not however mention my disgrace with the Emperor of Lilliput since I did not suppose that prince would disclose the secret while I was out of his power. But in this it soon appeared I was deceived.Three days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the island I observed at some distance in the sea something that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings and wading two or three hundred yards I plainly saw it to be a real boat which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship. I returned immediately to the city for help and after a huge amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu where a great crowd of people appeared full of wonder at sight of so prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to my native country and begged his orders for materials to fit it up and leave to departwhich after many kindly speeches he was pleased to grant.Meanwhile the Emperor of Lilliput uneasy at my long absence but never imagining that I had the least notice of his designs sent a person of rank to inform the Emperor of Blefuscu of my disgrace this messenger had orders to represent the great mercy of his master who was content to punish me with the loss of my eyes and who expected that his brother of Blefuscu would have me sent back to Lilliput bound hand and foot to be punished as a traitor. The Emperor of Blefuscu answered with many civil excuses. He said that as for sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible. Moreover though I had taken away his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace. But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he had given orders to fit up and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be free from me.With this answer the messenger returned to Lilliput and I though the monarch of Blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if I would continue in his service hastened my departure resolving never more to put confidence in princes.In about a month I was ready to take leave. The Emperor of Blefuscu with the Empress and the royal family came out of the palace and I lay down on my face to kiss their hands which they graciously gave me. His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of sprugs their greatest gold coin and his picture at full length which I put immediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt. Many other ceremonies took place at my departure.I stored the boat with meat and drink and took six cows and two bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them into my own country and to feed them on board I had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means permit and besides a diligent search into my pockets his Majesty pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects though with their own consent and desire.Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able I set sail. When I had made twentyfour leagues by my reckoning from the island of Blefuscu I saw a sail steering to the northeast. I hailed her but could get no answer yet I found I gained upon her for the wind slackened and in half an hour she spied me and discharged a gun. I came up with her between five and six in the evening Sept. 26 1701 but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets and got on board with all my little cargo. The captain received me with kindness and asked me to tell him what place I came from last but at my answer he thought I was raving. However I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket which after great astonishment clearly convinced him.We arrived in England on the 13th of April 1702. I stayed two months with my wife and family but my eager desire to see foreign countries would suffer me to remain no longer. However while in England I made great profit by showing my cattle to persons of quality and others and before I began my second voyage I sold them for 600l. I left 1500l. with my wife and fixed her in a good house then taking leave of her and my boy and girl with tears on both sides I sailed on board the Adventure.
A Soldier gave his Horse a plentiful supply of oats in time of war and tended him with the utmost care for he wished him to be strong to endure the hardships of the field and swift to bear his master when need arose out of the reach of danger. But when the war was over he employed him on all sorts of drudgery bestowing but little attention upon him and giving him moreover nothing but chaff to eat. The time came when war broke out again and the Soldier saddled and bridled his Horse and having put on his heavy coat of mail mounted him to ride off and take the field. But the poor halfstarved beast sank down under his weight and said to his rider You will have to go into battle on foot this time. Thanks to hard work and bad food you have turned me from a Horse into an ass and you cannot in a moment turn me back again into a Horse.
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts. They were always very polite when they met but in spite of that they kept a close watch one upon the other as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else. But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that.One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime. He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his just where the river runs into the sea. There just as he had hoped he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe.I want to fish too cried the wolf. But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear.I wish you would take me into your boat shouted the wolf louder than before and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in.Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset said the mink and if you care about seaurchins eggs you will find plenty in that basket. But be sure you eat only the white ones for the red ones would kill you.So the wolf who was always hungry began to eat the eggs greedily and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap.Well then stretch yourself out and rest your head on that piece of wood said the mink. And the wolf did as he was bid and was soon fast asleep. Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife and he died without moving. After that he landed on the beach skinned the wolf and taking the skin to his cottage he hung it up before the fire to dry.Not many days later the wolfs grandmother who with the help of her relations had been searching for him everywhere entered the cottage to buy some seaurchins eggs and saw the skin which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson.I knew he was deadI knew it I knew it she cried weeping bitterly till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet. So halfblinded by her tears the old woman went home the way she had come and running in at the door she flung herself down in front of the fire.What are you crying for asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him.I shall never see my grandson any more answered she. Mink has killed him oh oh And putting her head down she began to weep as loudly as ever.There there said her husband laying his paw on her shoulder. Be comforted if he IS dead we will avenge him. And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan. It took them a long time to make up their minds as one wolf proposed one thing and one another but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house and that the mink should be invited to the party. And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him.Now the wolves thought they were very cunning but the mink was more cunning still and though he sent a message by a white hare that was going that way saying he should be delighted to be present he determined that he would take his precautions. So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn and greeted her with his best bow.I have a favour to ask of you friend mouse said he and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill.The favour is mine answered the mouse. Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you.Oh something quite easy replied the mink. I only want youbetween today and the next full moonto gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people so that directly they use them they will break. But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing.Of course answered the mouse nothing is easier but as the full moon is tomorrow night and there is not much time I had better begin at once. Then the mink thanked her and went his way but before he had gone far he came back again.Perhaps while you are about the wolfs house seeing after the bows it would do no harm if you were to make that knothole in the wall a little bigger said he. Not large enough to draw attention of course but it might come in handy. And with another nod he left her.The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast. He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track and perceived that though the marks of wolves feet were many not a single guest was to be seen anywhere. He knew very well what that meant but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid.The house door stood open but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it. However he entered boldly and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang and the whole herd sprang at him with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths. Quick as they were they were too late for the mink was already through the knothole and racing for his canoe.The knothole was too small for the wolves and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open. Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and once outside aimed at the flying mink but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws so they threw them away and bounded to the shore with all their speed to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach.Now although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves he had a good start and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe. They pushed off but as they dipped the paddles into the water they snapped as the bows had done and were quite useless.I know where there are some new ones cried a young fellow leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach. And the minks heart smote him when he heard for he had not known of this secret store.After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey and the mink seeing it was no good resisting any more gave himself up. Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands which they always carried wound round their bodies but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them.Why I could snap those in a moment said he if you want to make sure that I cannot escape better take a line of kelp and bind me with that.You are right answered the grandfather your wisdom is greater than ours. And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line as they had brought none with them.While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance remarked the mink. And the wolves replied Very good you may have your dance perhaps it may amuse us as well as you. So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other. The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance first in one canoe and then in the other and so graceful was he that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death and howled with pleasure.Pull the canoes a little apart they are too close for this new dance he said pausing for a moment. And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both. Now nearer now further apart he would cry as the dance went on. No further still. And springing into the air amidst howls of applause he came down headforemost and dived to the bottom. And through the wolves whose howls had now changed into those of rage sought him everywhere they never found him for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight and then made his home in another forest.
Once there were two young men very good friends who were unhappy because neither of them had been tattooed. They felt that they were not as beautiful as their friends.One day they agreed to tattoo each other. One marked the breast and back of the other his arms and legs and even his face. And when he had finished he took soot off the bottom of a cookingpot and rubbed it into all the marks and he was tattooed beautifully.The one who had done the work said to the otherNow my friend you are very beautiful and you must tattoo me.Then the tattooed one scraped a great pile of black soot off the cookingpots and before the other knew what he was about he had rubbed it all over him from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet and he was very black and greasy. The one who was covered with soot became very angry and criedWhy do you treat me so when I tattooed you so carefullyThey began to fight but suddenly the beautifully tattooed one became a great lizard which ran away and hid in the tall grass while the sooty one became a crow and flew away over the village.
A fox though young by no means rawHad seen a horse the first he ever sawHo neighbour wolf said he to one quite greenA creature in our meadow I have seenSleek grand I seem to see him yetThe finest beast I ever met.Is he a stouter one than weThe wolf demanded eagerlySome picture of him let me see.If I could paint said fox I should delightT anticipate your pleasure at the sightBut come who knows perhaps it is a preyBy fortune offerd in our way.They went. The horse turnd loose to grazeNot liking much their looks and waysWas just about to gallop off.Sir said the fox your humble servants weMake bold to ask you what your name may be.The horse an animal with brains enoughReplied Sirs you yourselves may read my nameMy shoer round my heel hath writ the same.The fox excusd himself for want of knowledgeMe sir my parents did not educateSo poor a hole was their entire estate.My friend the wolf however taught at collegeCould read it were it even Greek.The wolf to flattery weakApproachd to verify the boastFor which four teeth he lost.The high raised hoof came down with such a blowAs laid him bleeding on the ground full low.My brother said the fox this shows how justWhat once was taught me by a fox of witWhich on thy jaws this animal hath writAll unknown things the wise mistrust.
My father left me the best inheritance to witgood humour. And who was my father Why that has nothing to do with the humour. He was lively and stout round and fat and his outer and inner man were in direct contradiction to his calling. And pray what was he by profession and calling in civil society Yes if this were to be written down and printed in the very beginning of a book it is probable that many when they read it would lay the book aside and say It looks so uncomfortable I dont like anything of that sort.And yet my father was neither a horse slaughterer nor an executioner on the contrary his office placed him at the head of the most respectable gentry of the town and he held his place by right for it was his right place. He had to go first before the bishop even and before the princes of the blood. He always went firstfor he was the driver of the hearseThere now its out And I will confess that when people saw my father sitting perched up on the omnibus of death dressed in his long wide black cloak with his blackbordered threecornered hat on his headand then his face exactly as the sun is drawn round and jocundit was difficult for them to think of the grave and of sorrow.The face said It doesnt matter it doesnt matter it will be better than one thinks.You see I have inherited my good humour from him and also the habit of going often to the churchyard which is a good thing to do if it be done in the right spirit and then I take in the Intelligencer just as he used to do.I am not quite young. I have neither wife nor children nor a library but as aforesaid I take in the Intelligencer and thats my favourite newspaper as it was also my fathers. It is very useful and contains everything that a man needs to knowsuch as who preaches in the church and in the new books. And then what a lot of charity and what a number of innocent harmless verses are found in it Advertisements for husbands and wives and requests for interviewsall quite simple and natural. Certainly one may livemerrily and be contentedly buried if one takes in the Intelligencer.And as a concluding advantage by the end of his life a man will havesuch a capital store of paper that he may use it as a soft bedunless he prefers to rest upon woodshavings.The newspaper and my walk to the churchyard were always my most exciting occupationsthey were like bathingplaces for my good humour.The newspaper every one can read for himself. But please come with me to the churchyard let us wander there where the sun shines and the trees grow green. Each of the narrow houses is like a closed book with the back placed uppermost so that one can only read the title and judge what the book contains but can tell nothing about it but I know something of them. I heard it from my father or found it out myself. I have it all down in my record that I wrote out for my own use and pleasure all that lie here and a few more too are chronicled in it.Now we are in the churchyard.Here behind this white railing where once a rose tree grewit is gone now but a little evergreen from the next grave stretches out its green fingers to make a showthere rests a very unhappy man and yet when he lived he was in what they call a good position. He had enough to live upon and something over but worldly cares or to speak more correctly his artistic taste weighed heavily upon him. If in the evening he sat in the theatre to enjoy himself thoroughly he would be quite put out if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon or if the skypieces hung down over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them or when a palm tree wasintroduced into a scene representing the Berlin Zoological Gardens or a cactus in a view of the Tyrol or a beech tree in the far north of NorwayAs if that was of any consequence. Is it not quite immaterial Who would fidget about such a trifle Its only makebelieve after all and every one is expected to be amused. Then sometimes the public applauded too much to suit his taste and sometimes too little.Theyre like wet wood this evening he would say they wont kindle at all And then he would look round to see what kind of people they were and sometimes he would find them laughing at the wrong time when they ought not to have laughed and that vexed him and he fretted and was an unhappy man and at last fretted himself into his grave.Here rests a very happy man. That is to say a very grand man. He was of high birth and that was lucky for him for otherwise he would never have been anything worth speaking of and nature orders all that very wisely so that its quite charming when we think of it. He used to go about in a coat embroidered back and front and appeared in the saloons of society just like one of those costly pearlembroidered bellpulls which have always a good thick serviceable cord behind them to do the work. He likewise had a good stout cord behind him in the shape of a substitute who did his duty and who still continues to do it behind another embroidered bellpull. Everything is so nicely managed its enough to put one into a good humour.Here restswell its a very mournful reflectionhere rests a man who spent sixtyseven years considering how he should get a good idea. The object of his life was to say a good thing and at last he felt convinced in his own mind that he had got one and was so glad of it that he died of pure joy at having caught an idea at last. Nobody derived any benefit from it and no one even heard what the good thing was. Now I can fancy that this same good thing wont let him live quiet in his grave for let us suppose that it is a good thing which can only be brought out at breakfast if it is to make an effect and that he according to the received opinion concerning ghosts can onlyrise and walk at midnight. Why then the good thing would not suit thetime and the man must carry his good idea down with him again. Whatan unhappy man he must beHere rests a remarkably stingy woman. During her lifetime she used to get up at night and mew so that the neighbours might think she kept a catshe was so remarkably stingy.Here is a maiden of another kind. When the canary bird of the heart begins to chirp reason puts her fingers in her ears. The maiden was going to be married butwell its an everyday story and we will let the dead rest.Here sleeps a widow who carried melody in her mouth and gall in her heart. She used to go out for prey in the families round about and the prey she hunted was her neighbours faults and she was an indefatigable hunter.Heres a family sepulchre. Every member of this family held so firmly to the opinions of the rest that if all the world and the newspapers into the bargain said of a certain thing it is so and so and the little boy came home from school and said Ive learned it thus and thus they declared his opinion to be the only true one because he belonged to the family. And it is an acknowledged fact that if the rooster of the family crowed at midnight they would declare it was morning though the watchmen and all the clocks in the city were crying out that it was twelve oclock at night.The great poet Gothe concludes his Faust with the words may be continued and our wanderings in the churchyard may be continued too. If any of my friends or my nonfriends go on too fast for me I go out to my favourite spot and select a mound and bury him or her therebury that person who is yet alive and there those I bury must stay till they come back as new and improved characters. I inscribe their life and their deeds looked at in my fashion in my record and thats what all people ought to do. They ought not to be vexed when any one goes on ridiculously but bury him directly and maintain their good humour and keep to the Intelligencer which is often a book written by the people with its hand guided.When the time comes for me to be bound with my history in the boards of the grave I hope they will put up as my epitaph A goodhumoured one. And thats my story.
Once upon a time there lived a husband and wife and they were both bound in gossipry with a certain man. The husband got arrested and was taken away to prison. Now the gossip was very fond of his cummer and used often to go and visit her. One day she said to him Gossip shall we go and see my husband Gnursi cummari Certainly cummer said her gossip so off they went. On the way they bought a large melonfor it was the melon seasonto take to the poor prisoner. We are but flesh and blood The gossip and his cummer sinned against St. John. In short they brought things to a pretty pass. St. John wasnt going to let that pass unpunished. When they had come to the prison and had visited the prisoner before going away they wanted to make a present to the jailer so they gave him the melon. He cut it open before their eyes. Horror of horrors When the melon was cut open there was found in the middle of it a head Now this was the head of St. John which had slipped itself in there for the purpose of bringing home their sin to the minds of the gossips. The matter immediately came to the ears of justice and they were arrested. They confessed the wrong they had done. The husband was set at liberty and the gossip and his cummer were sent to the gallows.
A countryman one day said to his little puppies Come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves and pick up the breadcrumbs on the table your mistress has gone out to pay some visits. Then the little dogs said No no we will not go. If the mistress gets to know it she will beat us. The countryman said She will know nothing about it. Do come after all she never gives you anything good. Then the little dogs again said Nay nay we must let it alone we must not go. But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went and got on the table and ate up the breadcrumbs with all their might. But at that very moment the mistress came and seized the stick in great haste and beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the house the little dogs said to the countryman Dost dost dost dost dost thou see Then the countryman laughed and said Didnt didnt didnt you expect it So they just had to run away.
Once upon a time Simba the lion Feesee the hyena and Keeteetee the rabbit made up their minds to go in for a little farming. So they went into the country made a garden planted all kinds of seeds and then came home and rested quite a while.Then when the time came when their crops should be about ripe and ready for harvesting they began to say to each other Lets go over to the farm and see how our crops are coming along.So one morning early they started and as the garden was a long way off Keeteetee the rabbit made this proposition While we are going to the farm let us not stop on the road and if any one does stop let him be eaten. His companions not being so cunning as he and knowing they could outwalk him readily consented to this arrangement.Well off they went but they had not gone very far when the rabbit stopped.Hullo said Feesee the hyena Keeteetee has stopped. He must be eaten.Thats the bargain agreed Simba the lion.Well said the rabbit I happened to be thinking.What about cried his partners with great curiosity.Im thinking said he with a grave philosophical air about those two stones one big and one little the little one does not go up nor does the big one go down.The lion and the hyena having stopped to look at the stones could only say Why really its singular but its just as you say and they all resumed their journey the rabbit being by this time well rested.When they had gone some distance the rabbit stopped again. Aha said Feesee Keeteetee has stopped again. Now he must be eaten.I rather think so assented Simba.Well said the rabbit I was thinking again.Their curiosity once more aroused his comrades begged him to tell them his think.Why said he I was thinking this When people like us put on new coats where do the old ones go toBoth Simba and Feesee having stopped a moment to consider the matter exclaimed together Well I wonder and the three went on the rabbit having again had a good rest.After a little while the hyena thinking it about time to show off a little of his philosophy suddenly stopped.Here growled Simba this wont do I guess well have to eat you Feesee.Oh no said the hyena Im thinking.What are you thinking about they inquired.Im thinking about nothing at all said he imagining himself very smart and witty.Ah pshaw cried Keeteetee we wont be fooled that way.So he and Simba ate the hyena.When they had finished eating their friend the lion and the rabbit proceeded on their way and presently came to a place where there was a cave and here the rabbit stopped.Hm ejaculated Simba Im not so hungry as I was this morning but I guess Ill have to find room for you little Keeteetee.Oh I believe not replied Keeteetee Im thinking again.Well said the lion what is it this timeSaid the rabbit Im thinking about that cave. In olden times our ancestors used to go in here and go out there and I think Ill try and follow in their footsteps.So he went in at one end and out at the other end several times.Then he said to the lion Simba old fellow lets see you try to do that and the lion went into the cave but he stuck fast and could neither go forward nor back out.In a moment Keeteetee was on Simbas back and began eating him.After a little time the lion cried Oh brother be impartial come and eat some of the front part of me.But the rabbit replied Indeed I cant come around in front Im ashamed to look you in the face.So having eaten all he was able to he left the lion there and went and became sole owner of the farm and its crops.
O it was so hot so hot the earth was wellnigh parched up and moreover the use of water was restricted in the town where the children lived. The flowers in the little garden were drooping for want of moisture and the trees began to shed their leaves as if it were already autumn instead of July. The schools were obliged to close early the children came home at eleven oclock instead of at one and announced that they had heat holidays. For there is a regulation in Germany if the thermometer is over a certain degree in the shade the school is closed for the rest of the day. The high schools do not have classes in the afternoon the children have six hours lessons in the morning with intervals of course for recreation and drilling. Some headmasters douche the walls of the schoolbuilding with cold water and then examine the thermometer but children as well as teachers think this a very mean thing to do.The school holidays commence at the beginning of July not in August as is the case in England. This year the two little girls Trudel and Lottchen and their mother were going to stay at a farm which was situated high up in the midst of the most lovely woods. Trudel I must tell you was ten years old and Lottchen eight they both went to the same school. This farm was an inn at the same time but very few people visited it during the week and by nine oclock the house was empty of guests for the woodways were hardly safe at night. It was easy to get lost in those vast forests where one path so closely resembles the other.It was a long climb up from the station the children began to flag and mother was tired. Father had come with them to settle them in but he could not stay longer than the first day or two for his holidays did not begin till August. He invented all sorts of games for getting along quicker he deposited chocolate on stones or treestumps by the wayside which was discovered by the children with a shout of joy. Then just as Lottchens legs were beginning to ache badly and she was nearly crying he helped them on by telling the story of the assassination of Julius Csar. Trudel had read about it in her historybook at school but it was written in such dreadfully historical language that she had not understood the story she found it thrillingly interesting as father told it. Lottchen said that she could never have treated her little friend Hansi so cruelly and that she hated that man Brutus.At last they reached the end of the woodpath and there lay Waldheimfor so the farm was calledbefore them. A big dog sprang out to meet them. Mother and Lottchen shrank back from his rough welcome but Trudel was soon ordering him about and did not seem in the least surprised when he obeyed her. His name was Bruno. The farm consisted of a group of buildings two houses one for the farm labourers and the maids the other for guests. There were also large barns which had been newly erected and a pond.Round the houses were fields belonging to the farm and then everywhere woods woods woods. Blue mountaincrests were visible above and beyond the woods.The children partly unpacked the boxes themselves for mother was still so tired. They even took off her boots and put on her shoes for her like kind little daughters and Trudel put away their clothes neatly in the cupboard. Then they all went downstairs joyfully to a cosy tea which I need hardly say they enjoyed very much after their long walk and journey.After tea all fatigue vanished and the children flew out to inspect the premises for themselves. The farmer had two boys of about the same age as Trudel and Lottchen. Their names were Hermann and Fritz. Hermann was very shy he hid himself at first and peeped out at the strange girls from corners of the yard or barns rushing away when they caught sight of him. However Trudel soon coaxed him out and they all played ball together.Then Hermann and Fritz took the girls round the farm. They went first into the cowshed there were fourteen cows seven calves and a bull. The cowherd was a strange uncannylooking fellow with a great shock of red hair and a very red face. He shouted at the children in a dreadful hoarse voice they felt frightened of him at first and thought he was mad but they soon found out that the poor fellow was only deaf and dumb. The cows were his intimate friends. He had christened each one of them when they were born Sophie Emma and so on. After they had gone home again the children learnt to their pride that he had named two new calves after them Trudel and Lotty.There were four horses that were used for driving and ploughing. Lottchen was especially fond of horses. She liked to see them come home from the field by themselves and walk straight into the stable with a noble air like a lord returning to his castle. Her favourite horse was called Hector. Lotty noticed one day that he was left alone in the stable whilst the other horses were ploughing in the field. The stabledoor was open and after a while to her surprise he walked out. What is he going to do I hope he will not run away and get lost thought Lotty anxiously. But no he just walked leisurely up to the field where the other horses were hard at work and looked on It was evidently dull in the stable and he wanted a little distraction. When he was tired of watching his friends he returned to the stable where he was found innocently munching hay as if nothing had happened.Pigs of course were there too in plenty they ran about everywhere grunting and snorting also geese and chickens. Trudel liked to drive the geese into the water she was fond of commanding as her little sister sometimes knew to her cost.The maids were two peasant girls who wore very short full skirts and a great many petticoats. Their dress was a modification of the wonderful Hessen peasant costume. These girls were ready to do anything for the children. Gustel who was chief waitress and chambermaid at the same time said that she had never seen such pretty kindersche little children in all her life beforeThe only other guest in the house at this time was a Herr Baron he told wonderful stories of his adventures in South America.Drought he said yes thats very bad but floods may be worse. I have known years of labour destroyed in one night by a flood. All the beautiful fields of grain our sole wealth. I lived at that time with my married sister and her family and we had only just time to rescue ourselves and the children. I was the last to leave the house which we were never to see again. I could not decide which of my possessions to take with me so I seized up the skin of a puma that I had shot on another memorable occasion and bore it off on my shoulder like Jason carrying the golden fleece and that was all that was left of my personal property. Ah it needs patience to conquer the elements he said.Altogether the Herr Baron was a wonderful character he seemed as if he were not real but had stepped out of a book of romance. He delighted in reading English stories he was especially fond of She and King Solomons Mines. The children believed that he smoked day and night for they had never seen him without a cigarette except at mealtimes.He told father and mother the story of how he had had a bullet extracted from his side that he had carried about with him for years. It had struck him during one of the revolutions that so frequently go on in South America. The bullet had recently set up inflammation and a dangerous operation was necessary to remove it. Chloroform not if I know it he said to the doctors. Just you let me smoke my cigar and I shall be all right. I wont say OhThe doctors were naturally very astonished and demurred at this new method of treatment but he persisted in his determination and the cigar never left his mouth till the painful business was successfully overThe Herr Baron was a mysterious person why he lived for months together in that lonely spot no one knew. True he was fond of hunting and went out at nights with the landlord to hunt the stag.There were huntingboxes made of logs of wood with steps that led up into them placed in different positions in the woods near the inn.The children loved to climb up into them. A huntingbox made such a nice airy room they said but mother was glad when they were down again without broken limbs.Mother was surprised when she entered the innparlour to find the Herr Baron engaged in a game of quartette with Trudel and Lottchen and Fritz. Indeed he was so sociable and kind and fond of children that she thought it was a pity that he had none of his own.On the pond near the house were two most remarkablelooking boats. These Hermann and Fritz had made themselves with the aid I believe of the Herr Baron. They had a long stick and punted about in them on the water and they managed them quite cleverly. To Trudel and Lottchen they seemed to suggest Robinson Crusoe and all sorts of fine adventures.One day when mother was reading a book which absorbed her attention and so was safe not to interfere with them they thought the children stole down to the pond. Hermann and Fritz were waiting for them. It was a preconceived plan. Come along and get in they shouted to the girls.I darent said Lottchen. Mother would be so cross she has forbidden us to go near the water.You are surely not going to spoil the fun said Trudel. Come along Im going to get in first. I can swim you knowBut not in mud and waterweeds said Lottchen wisely.The boys began to laugh at them.Why youre funky I do believe the pond isnt really deep anywhere they said.So with beating hearts the children got into the boats Trudel with Fritz and Hermann who was the eldest of the party with Lottchen. It was splendid quite a real adventure.Sit still in the middle of the boat said Fritz I think we had better keep near the bank.Its going down on my side O dear what shall I do said Trudel. I dont like it I want to get out.Youre a bit too heavy and upset the balance said Fritz. Very well then get outTrudel tried to do so but the boat was very wobbly. It was not so easy her foot slipped and in she stepped with one foot into the deep mud. She grasped convulsively hold of a willow bush that grew on the bank.Meanwhile Hermann seeing the predicament they were in jumped out of his boat leaving poor Lottchen quite alone. She began to scream with all her might and main and she could make a fine noise when she chose.Mother heard the cries though she was some way off and flew to the pond.The maids who were bleaching the linen in the meadow came running to the rescue as well as fast as their legs could carry them.Lotty was soon helped out of the boat. Trudel had rescued herself with Hermanns assistance and she looked very red and ashamed of herself. She said she did not wish for any more Robinson Crusoe adventures of that sort. Mother naturally gave the children a good talking to but she thought they had been punished enough this time for their disobedience by the fright they had had.The Tree ManThere was a tree in the garden that was ideal to climb and mother allowed the children to do so for she had been very fond of climbing herself when she was a child.They wore old serge skirts and jerseys that they could not spoil.This tree made a splendid arbour or house with a suite of rooms. Lottchen sat up in the branches like a little bird and like a little bird she sang all the songs she knew. From this tree you could see the mountain called the Stellerskuppe and the blue sky through the treestems on the summit. At sunset time the sky behind the trees turned a golden colour till it looked like a picture of fairyland.It was a fine view but still you could not see from here the famous oaktree where the little green tree man lived. This was ten minutes walk from the farm.Trudel and Lottchen saw him first on a wet day when they had set out for a walk in spite of the rain with their green waterproof cloaks on with hoods over their heads looking for all the world like woodgoblins themselves. They were walking down a narrow green path and mother was some distance behind.Do just look Trudel said Lottchen. I believe there is a little man in that hollow treeSo there is he is smiling and bowing to us lets go and visit him said Trudel always enterprising.Lottchen hung back feeling a little afraid she was always on the lookout for the unexpected and yet was surprised when something really happened.Come along darling said Trudel grasping her smaller sister by the hand.They both distinctly saw the little man they said they could have drawn him afterwards and indeed they attempted to do so as well as they could. But as they approached the venerable oak the little man vanished and all they saw was a strange green stain on the inside of the tree resembling a dwarf with a peaked hood on.Just look at this Gothic window said Lottchen proud of her knowledge of the word Gothic. How nicely this treeroom is carved. I am sure he lives here where are his little chairs and tables I should love to see them.They peeped through a window or hole in the old tree and saw their mother approaching.Mother mother here lives a real tree man we saw himdidnt youMother smiledwhat the children called her mysterious smile.You look like two little woodmen yourselves she said. Lottchen stand up straight in the hole and look at me.Lottchen stood up just fitting into the green mark on the tree behind her. She made a pretty picture her laughing brown eyes with the long eyelashes her rosy cheeks and the windblown hair straying from under her hood.O look Lottchen here is a little basin of holy water just like we saw in the cathedral said Trudel.Wood waterNice and brownIn a little cup.Wood waterWood wineWont you drink it upsaid a tiny voice that sounded like that of a woodbird.Mother did you hear anything motherYes darlings the birds are singing so sweetly now the rain is over. I have brought my campstool. I shall sit here and sketch the tree said mother.Do draw him said Trudel whose blue eyes were open wider than usual.Him Whom do you mean said mother.Why the tree man of course.Hum said mother mysteriously well see and she settled herself down to sketch.The children collected huge acorns and laid them on a leaf in the hollow tree. Then they stirred up the brackish holy water and put their fingers in it.It smells like lavender and roses said Lottchen.Well youve got a funny nose it smells to me like blackberry and appletart said Trudel.Hahahe said a little voice again. Somebody was laughing. Where could he be Glancing round quickly the children saw a little man about three feet high dressed in green wearing a long peaked cap with a wreath of tiny oakleaves around it. He looked very strong although he was small and he stuck his arms out akimbo in a curious angular way like the branches of an oaktree.How did you know that trees were alive he asked the children.They were embarrassed by the question.Why of course we know they are not dead unless they are cut down they said.The little man shuddered then he began to wave his arms about wildly.Let them try to cut me down Ill knock them down. Ill fall on them and crush their bones. Ill smash them like this stone Here he gave a stone that stood near by such a tremendous whack that sparks flew out of it.Dont smash us please Mr Tree Man said Lottchen trembling.No fear little Miss Lottchen no fear youre a nice little thing you are one can see that to look at you. You would never cut me down would youWhy of course not said Lotty.I should not dream of such a thing either said Trudel. But may we ask who you are Trudel continued You are surely not a treeWell its like this said the little man Im a tree and the trees meI said Trudel correcting him would be more correct.Rubbish said the little man Pedantic rotthe trees me I repeat. Every tree has its gnome or elf they used to call us dryads in old times but nowadays people are getting so cocksure of knowing everything that they cant see what is going on right under their noses. Trees are never still he continued they are always moving.Where there is movement there is lifeWhere there is life there is thoughtWhere there is thought there is individuality.Do you follow me That is logically expressed.You forget we are only children Mr Tree Man you are talking too grownupy for us. Father talks like that sometimes but then we dont listen they replied.Well continued the gnome in every tree there either lives a jolly fellow like me or a lovely lady fairy. Yes he said in a sentimental tone I too old and tough though I am I too have known love.Who is she asked Trudel eagerly.Alas I can never reach her my old bones are too stiff and unbendable. She is a graceful larchtree in all the glory of her youth. You may see her yonder He sat down and sighed deeply.The children looked in the direction that the gnome had indicated and there they saw a larchtree on which the sunlight had just fallen. It was exquisitely dressed in a robe of delicate green andwas it only fancyfor one moment the children thought that they saw a lovely lady with flowing tresses that gleamed golden in the sunlight and large starry eyes. As they gazed she melted into the blue mist which shimmers always between the forest trees.Now we must go home children mother called out before it begins to rain again.The children glanced round their little friend had vanished and no trace was to be seen of the lady of the larchtree. So they turned reluctantly from the treehouse fully determined to come again very soon to this enchanted spot.Mother may we see your sketchNot now said mother its going to be a surprise.Did mother see him tooDo you think so said Lottchen. Mothers a fairy herself.I think said Trudel she sees all sorts of queer things but she wont tell us everything she sees.It spoils some things to tell about them said Lottchen. I shant tell Hermann and Fritz about the tree man.However when she got home again she could not contain herself. Do you believe in fairies and tree men she said to the boys.Of course not thats all rot said Hermann. Like Santa Claus and such things just invented to stuff us upSanta Claus will never come to you any more if you talk like that he is quite true I know. Trudel saw him come in last year when she was in bed and she heard him filling our stockings. Of course she did not dare to turn round and look at him said Lottchen.I dont say it isnt nice to believe such things said Hermann conscientiously but it isnt true its superstitious. You know quite well Trudel who Santa Claus really is.Trudel was silent she was ten years old and she had her doubts.But Ive seen a tree man today said Lotty.The boys laughed.Dont try to stuff us up with such nonsense were not so green as your tree man they said.Gustel the maid came in and joined in the conversation. She supported the boys view.I dont care said Lottchen now in a high state of excitement. My mother knows a mana very clever Irishmana poet and a painter as well and he has often seen the fairies.Yes said Trudel its true he draws them just as he sees them with rainbowcoloured wings.Well I never you dont expect me to believe such things do you said Gustel. Why thats all lies and it is very wicked to tell a lieLotty flew into a perfect tantrum. How dare you say we tell lies I will tell my mother of you she screamed and threw herself on the floor crying violently.Mother rushed in not knowing what had happened. Lotty get up at once tell me whats the matter darlingBoohboohboohGustel wont believebooh booh boohthat you know a man who has seen the fairiesMother could not help laughing. Dont be so absurd Lotty. Of course Gustel does not understand what you mean. Gustel she said you are a Catholic and believe in the saints they saw very queer things too sometimes didnt theyO yes youre right of course maam said Gustel feeling embarrassed for she had no arguments to support her disbelief in fairies.Some people can see more than others continued mother. Now if I were to tell you that I could see the old poacher or wild huntsman who used to live in this house riding through the yard on a moonlight night what would you sayLor maam if I saw him I should die of fright said Gustel turning pale.But you know that there are no such things as ghosts and fairiesYes maam very true maam its rather confusing what you say said poor Gustel feeling her head in a whirl.It was a wonderful moonlight night. As father was still away mother sat by herself in the big bedroom whilst the children slept in the little room adjoining. There was a very high wind the windowpanes rattled the wooden shutters blew to and fro the branches of the trees made weird patterns on the ground. The moonlight was so white that the fields and paths looked almost as if they were covered with snow. The Stellerskuppe stood out black against the sky. As mother gazed it seemed to her as if strange creatures were abroad that night driven to and fro by that tireless hunter the wind. Wild forms passed by and gazed at her with deathless eyes for a while she remained there motionless as under a spell. Then suddenly she remembered her joke about the old huntsman of evil repute who had formerly lived in this farmhouse. Did his ghost haunt it still Mother shivered the nights were cold up in the mountains though it was such a hot summer. She opened the door of the childrens room and peeped in. To tell the truth she felt a little creepy and longed for human companionship. There were her darlings sleeping soundly but as she entered the room Trudel turned round and flung herself on the other side of the bed saying Go away go away do not come near meWhom do you mean darling said mother anxiously.Then Trudel groaned and spoke again in her sleep. She uttered the following deep and mystic words Gustel bring in the shark please mother cant eat the thimble.Now wasnt that a funny thing for a little girl to say in her sleep. Mother was so amused that she wrote the words down on the spot so as not to forget them and she troubled her head no more with thoughts of the wild huntsman indeed the spectres of the night vanished as they always do vanish at a jokeSome days passed before the children visited the oaktree again. When they did so they found that an enormous branch had been broken off and lay across the green pathway.O dear me said Lottchen our poor little man. I hope it hasnt hurt himIt must have happened on that windy night said Trudel.It was my own fault it was entirely my own fault said a queer little voice and there was the oaktree man sitting in his house smoking a reed pipe. His arm was bound up with green fern leaves. Yes it was my own fault the wind excited me and stirred my sap thats my blood you knowI stretched out my arms towards herone embraceone blessed moment in which to call her mineand here you see me a cripple for everO poor thing we are so sorry for you said the children.Never mind it heals easily said the oak man but alas my beauty and my symmetry are gone for everYour leaves are so nice and fresh and your house is so pretty why you have got furniture in it said the children in astonishment.Such a pretty oak table and beautifully carved chairs where did you get them from asked Lottchen.I made them myself out of my own wood it cheered me up a bit said the little man. One must do something you know looks snug doesnt it Ah wellI have known love that is something to be proud of I have experienced the most pleasing of human emotions. Have you ever been in love he said inquisitively looking at Trudel who looked big enough in his eyes.Why no not exactly were only kiddies but still we do love lots of people of course said she.Your day will come your day will come. Do not desire the unattainable but content yourself with the reachable he said and yet Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all as the dear old poem says.Hes getting grand in his language again he is a funny little man said Trudel in a whisper to Lottchen.Stay said the tree man I have a good idea I will give you a card of introduction to her my beloved Lady Larchtree.He gave them an oak leaf with the words Edle Eiche printed on it which is in English Noble Oak.You need not say anything she will know it comes from me he said sighing sentimentally.Full of curiosity the children turned to go to the larchtree which was only a few steps further down the green pathway. The ardent lover watched the children from the window of his little house. They knocked three times on the bark of the larchtree and they were very pleased when a door opened in the tree and a lovely lady was revealed to them. Her dress was of green looped up with tiny pink flowers such as grow on the larches in early spring her hair streamed down like a soft veil about her. She hardly seemed to see the children at first when they presented their cards. She took the oakleaf cards and pressed them to her heart.Heart of oak King of the forest for ever mine she murmured and her words were like the sound that a little brook makes when it trickles beneath dark forest trees.He sends you his love said the children politely.You dear little things said Lady Larch it was so kind of you to come and call on me. So you understand trees and their language dear dear so young and so clever Would you like some wood wineNot if it is dirty water with caterpillars in it said Trudel.O dear no it is purified and refined it is most delicious. So saying she handed each of them a large acorn cup full and they drank the contents.It does taste nice dear fairy said the children like what we make ourselves at a dolls feast. May we ask you for some moreNo no it is very strong and would get into your heads and you would find out all about. No Im sorry  butChildren said mothers voice where are you I have been looking for you.We have only been to call on Lady Larch mother she has shut her door tight again or we would have introduced you to her said Lotty.They came home rather late that evening and found the farm in a great state of commotion. The redhaired cowherd was shouting and crying in an unintelligible way the house seemed to be deserted. They met the Herr Baron also preparing to set out in a hurry.Whats the matter Where is everybody said mother.The silly old cowherd has lost one of the best cows it has strayed off among the bushes and may die if it is exposed all night. Who knows where the poor creature may have got to in these vast woodsThe search went on till late at night the men including the Herr Baron walked miles with their lanterns but in vain. The deaf mute was in a dreadful state of mind and kept crying out in his harsh disagreeable voice Not my faultSchimmels fault. Schimmel was the cow.It was difficult enough to sleep that night but when mother had at last dropped into a light doze it must have been about four oclock in the morning she and the children were aroused by a great shouting and disturbance in the house. They looked out of the window andwhat do you thinkthere was the lost cow who had returned after all of her own accord. And with her a dear little black and white calf who frisked and bounded along as if it thought it was fine fun to be in the world on this lovely morning. Now wasnt that a queer thing children queerer than all the fairy stories you have read for this story is quite true you must knowIt was an exceptionally fine Sunday and as father had come down to spend the weekend mother and the children were in the seventh heaven of joy. It was not possible to go to church for the nearest town was two hours walk away and would be partly over fields that were exposed to the heat of the midday sun. So father and mother and their two little daughters went to the great woodland cathedral.The service was on the Stellerskuppe surely no one could wish for a more beautiful place of worship. Mountain after mountain ranged in the distance some with rounded or knolled heads others rising to a peak. Lottchen called the most pointed one Mesuvius because she always forgot the V.As the children sat there and sang hymns with their white Sunday frocks on mother fancied that eyes were peering at them from out the forest depths. If they were merely those of the gentle deer or if stranger creatures still were watching them as if fascinated she did not know she felt there were lookerson. There is the old story of the God Pan who played so divinely that all living things came to listen to him. Perhaps there may be a stirring at times in the souls of the mysterious dwellers in the forest that makes them yearn for immortality and gives them a fuller sense of existence. So that all the woodland sang too at that Sunday service.On Sunday afternoon father and mother wanted to go for a longer walk than usual but the lazy children petitioned to be left behind.You will promise not to go near the pond said mother. Remember it is Sunday and you have your best frocks on you must not romp or climb trees.O no mother of course not said Trudel. Well stay in the garden and promise to be very good.When father and mother returned from their walk the first thing they saw was Lottchen staggering along with a stand of empty beerbottles.Whatever are you doing LottchenOh mother there are such heaps of people here this afternoon and there are not enough waitresses to serve them so Trudel and I are helping. Trudel has got such a lot of tips already she has bought chocolate with the money. Do tell her to divide it fairly with meMother looked round. The whole place was covered with tables and benches a number of gaily dressed people from the neighbouring town were drinking coffee and eating cake or waffeln a kind of pancake for which the inn was celebrated.Mother dont speak to me Im too busy said Trudel. Ive been waiting on those gentlemen the maids were shy of them so I said I would go and ask what they wanted. She pointed out some young men in officers uniform who had come from a military school. Ive got 6d. in tips and I spent it on chocolate.Well I never said mother astonished at her daughters prowessyou have turned into a waitress and on Sunday afternoon too. Whatever would your aunts sayI think I had better tell you what the young men said to me said Trudel seriously. They said I was a sweet little thing and that if I were older they would fall in love with me. I laughed of course I could see they were only silly old stupid heads. I told them they had not much taste for their military school was the ugliest building in all the town. They quite agreed with me about this however and then they asked me who my father was and when I said he was a professor they laughed till I thought they would burst. But now you must excuse me really mother darling. I have promised to go into the kitchen and wash up cups and saucersThe landlady could not praise Trudel enough. Such a useful little girl she does everything in a most orderly way and wipes down the table when she has finished If ever you want her to learn housekeeping pray send her to me I should be delighted to teach her she said.Yes thought mother and make a nice little slavey of her into the bargain. No no our Trudel is not going to turn into a housemaidIf Trudel had been some years older father and mother might have objected to these experiences but as it was they only laughed.As the world is full of fact and fancy so is this story. Whether it is based mostly on fact or on fancy we will leave to the German philosophers to decide but I have heard that they are doubtful on this point with regard to the world I mean.It was a magical evening. Trudel was so engrossed in a game of cards with the boys that she could not be induced to come out moreover she had a slight cold and the evenings were chilly. A glorious sunset glow illumined the sky as mother and Lottchen set out for their nevertobeforgotten walk.We will go up and see the fire on the heath I love the smell of dry pine wood burning said mother.I love to see the fire dancing and crackling said Lottchen. How still everything is.It is the calm of twilight. The wind usually drops in the evening said mother.Look look over there by those dark woods there is something moving said Lotty. I think it is a white cat.A white cat How queer that she should have strayed so far she does not belong to the farm I know.Hush perhaps she is not a cat at allthen she will vanish. And lo and behold when they looked again there was no cat there though they had distinctly seen it a minute before on the field at the woods edge.She is really a witch I believe said mother with the curious expression on her face that Lotty knew so well.Going further up the hill they saw a wonderful sight. Twenty or more peasant girls were busy working hacking the ground their faces illuminated by the wonderful sunset glow. They wore short full peasant skirts edged with brightcoloured ribbons and each had a gaily coloured scarf pinned round the neck and bodice.We learned afterwards that they were preparing the ground to plant young firtrees on a clearing. Germans are so careful of their woods they replant what has been cut down so that they have a great wealth in wood that we cannot boast of in England. I believe that they would like to cut off all the dead branches in order to make the woods quite tidy But this would be rather too big a job even for the German nation to accomplishA man dressed in green with a feather in his cap and a gun over his shoulder stood by watching the girls at their work.He was a forester and seemed to act as overseer. He gave the signal to stop work as the strangers mother and Lotty approached. The women hid their tools under the dry heather until the next day and then strapped on the big baskets they carried on their backs without which they hardly felt properly dressed. They then marched along together singing a melodious song in unison. As they came to the crossroads they parted company some went this way some that all kept up the tune which echoed farther and farther fainter and fainter in the distance.Before long Lottchen and her mother were alone but they felt that the ground they stood on was enchanted. Mother said it was like a scene from the opera. They watched the fire how the flames leaped and crackled yet they were dying down. The fire made a bright contrast to the dark firwoods which formed the background to the picture. The glory died from the sky but yet it was strangely light darker and darker grew the woods near the fire. Suddenly Lotty espied bright sparks among the trees.I do believe they have set the wood on fire said mother.O no mother dont you see let us crouch down and hide it is the fairies they are coming to the fire.The air was suddenly full of bright beings.There is a wood fire on the hillHigh on the heath it glimmers still.Who are these beings in the airWith gauzy robes and flowing hairIs it the wreathing smoke I seeThat forms itself so curiously Nay they alight they form a ringAround the flickering fire springAnd from those embers burning lowThey light their wands they gleam they glowLike firework stars of rainbow hueGreen yellow orange lilac blue Ah what a scene how wild how strangeThe stars each moment break and changeIn thousand colours look on highEach slender wand points to the skyThen waves and trembles lo afarOn lonely woods falls many a starAnd all this Trudel had missed. It seemed too great a pity with that silly old card playing.Spellbound mother and Lotty watched the fairies at their revels till Lottchen began to shiver.We really must go home whispered mother. Trudel will be anxious.Oh but mother I want to dance round the fire with the fairies and I want a fairy wand with shooting stars said Lotty almost aloud.Suddenly it seemed as if the fairies became aware that they were observed. They vanished away and all became dark. Lottchen said she could hear the sound of little feet stamping out the fire.Fairies dear fairies come again do said Lotty.No answer perfect stillness not even a leaf stirred.Well you are not so polite as our tree man not half said Lotty though you are so pretty. Good night she shouted.There was a sound of suppressed laughter then from hill and dale the word good night was echoed all around. Spellbound as if in a trance they moved toward the farm. Trudel was wild with herself when she heard what she had missed.Tomorrow she said but tomorrow is sometimes a long long way off and the fairies did not show themselves again during these holidays.One of Lottchens favourite walks was the echo walk but she usually came home quite hoarse after having been this way. The path wound below the fairy heath on the incline of the hill further down still were the firwoods through which the light shone.Angelpet Cherryripe Cheeky fellow Youre another So Lotty shouted the whole time and the echoes came back so surprisingly distinct that Lotty was sure it must be really the fairies answering her. When you turned the corner of the hill the echoes ceased. It was too queer.The next day Trudel distinguished herself again. Two great cartloads of swedes arrived that were to be stored up as fodder for the cattle in the winter. Now the joy was to throw these through a hole in the wall into the cellar. Hermann stood in the cart and Trudel threw the swedes to him as the bricklayers throw the bricks to one another. Fritz and Lottchen helped too they had to take their turn and be very quick as the hole was small. Hour after hour this went on till the children were as black as chimney sweeps and yet Trudels energy did not fail. At last the carts were empty and only then did the little workers leave off dead tired.Hermann could make curious heads out of the swedes with eyes and nose and mouth. If you put an old candleend inside they looked ghastly like some Chinese god. Lotty declared that they rolled about in the yard at night and grinned at her and that she did not like heads without people.But they are so funny Lottchen said mother and then she laughed at them and was not frightened any more.In the fields grew nice little buttony mushrooms. No one knew better than the Herr Baron where they were to be found and how to prepare them. Apparently he had lived on mushrooms in the wilds of South America. He was very kind in helping the children to fill their baskets to take home with them for alas even the pleasantest of holidays must come to an end and there was only one day left. He discovered a treasure in the field a little motherofpearl knife very old and rusty and presented it to Trudel. He told her to soak it in petroleum to clean it. That knife was more trouble than all the rest of the luggage on the way back for Trudel made such a fuss about it and dissolved in tears several times when she thought that she had lost it.To leave the beautiful cool woods the fairies the tree man and his sweetheart the cows and the geese and all the marvels of the country yes it was hard but home is home and always turns a smiling face to us after a long absence. How nice to rediscover ones playthings and dolls. Trudels first thought was always for her doll babies and she would rush upstairs and embrace each one tenderly.As the children drove to the station from the farm they passed the famous oaktree but no little man was to be seen.Hes shy of the coachman of course said the children.Looking back they caught a glimpse of him in the distance and shouted and waved their handkerchiefs.Hermann and Fritz were very sorry to say goodbye to their little friends but school began the next day and they would not have so much time for play then.The landlady told the children a great secret before they left. The Herr Baron is going to be married next week she said.Well I am glad said mother. I hope she is very nice and the children echoed the wish warmly.She has lots of money and is a countess I believe continued the landlady.Well I do hope she does not object to smoking said Trudel and they all laughed.Mother you have never shown us your sketch said Trudel during the unpacking.Mother laughed. Wheres Lottchen I suppose she wants to see it tooHere I am said Lotty. Oh do be quick and show it to usMother held up the sketch. There was the hollow oaktree and standing in it the little tree man himself just as the children had first seen him with his green peaked hood on.So mother really did see him too said the children.Now this story disproves the common fallacy that only children can see the fairies and forest folk for how could mother have painted the tree gnome unless she had seen him
When Kathleen did not come home at the time she was expected her father and her grandmother were not much surprised at first. She was in the habit of going where she pleased and of coming back when she pleased. If she chose to be an hour or two late her father or her grandmother might ask her why or they might not think of it. So on that May Eve when she danced with the Good People as it began to get late and still she did not come they had no doubt that she had decided to make her visit at the Sullivans a little longer than she had intended. When it got later and still she did not come her father said that he would walk over to the Sullivans and come back with her. He never thought of not finding her there. Even when he got there and Ellen told him that Kathleen had gone away hours ago and had said that she was going home he did not think that any harm could have come to her.She met some of the girls that she knew and went with them maybe he said and shell be home before me.But when he got home again and found that she was not there and when he told his mother that she was not at the Sullivans they both began to be a little worried. They told each other over and over that Kathleen knew how to take care of herself and that no harm was likely to come to her but they both doubted their own words. Late at night John went to the Sullivans again taking the way that he thought Kathleen would be likely to take and looking everywhere for her though he knew that to search for her in such a way as that was nonsense.It does not belong to the story to tell how they went on searching. All the next day they searched. They tried every way that they knew and every way that the police knew and every way that anybody could think of to find her and there was no trace. Late that day one of the girls who had walked through the Park with Kathleen came to see her not knowing that she was lost. Then she told where she had seen Kathleen last. She told how Kathleen had dropped behind the others though she had said that she wanted to get home early how they had called to her how she had answered and how they had gone on thinking that she would soon follow.Then Mrs. OBrien said to John You do not need to search for her any longer. She is with the Good People. I have seen that place often and it always looked to me like a place where the Good People might be. Last night was May Eve. There is no time in the whole year when the Good People have more power and especially to carry off young girls. They have taken her with them. Some time she may come back or some time we may get her back but it is of no use for you to search for her any more.But John went on searching still. The next day and for many days he looked for her and tried every means to find her but she could not be found. Again and again his mother told him that it was of no use but still he said It might be some use and I wouldnt be easy if I didnt try.By and by there came a time when even John did not think that there was any use in trying longer. He read many papers from many different cities hoping always to find something about some unknown girl who had been found sick or hurt or helpless somewhere but he said little about her. He went on with his old work and he and his mother were alone and lonely in the house. Then John came to believe that Kathleen was dead. He told his mother this and she answered Kathleen is not dead.And how do you know that mother John said. You always say that the Good People took her away but that might be true and still she might be dead by now. And the Good People might not have taken her at all. How do you knowI dont know that the Good People took her she answered though I think they did but I am sure she is not dead.And how are you sure motherKathleen could never die Mrs. OBrien said without Ild hear the banshee.The banshee said John. Theres no banshee here. Theres banshees only in Ireland.Our banshee is here his mother answered. I know she is here. Youve heard me tell of her. Shes the sad mourning woman of the Good People that weeps and wails about the house when anybody of the family is to die anywhere in the world. Its true as you say that the banshees mostly stay in Ireland though they are heard to cry and moan for those of the family who are to die in any part of the world. But sometimes the banshee leaves Ireland with the family that she belongs to and so did ours. Wouldnt I know her voice Didnt I hear her wail and scream before your father died so many many years ago Oh Ild never forget it. Ild know her voice.Then why didnt you hear her John asked before Kitty died and why didnt you know before that she was to dieI did hear the banshee that time his mother answered but I couldnt tell that it was Kitty that was to die. It was the night before she died. I heard a little moan that was more like the wind than anything else and then it grew louder and it was a sob and a soft wail. It did not grow very loud. Then I could hear that it was like the keen that the women cry over the dead at home. I knew that it was the banshee. No I could not be wrong about her I had heard her before. But I never thought of Kitty then. I thought Im an old womanan old womanthough I would never let them say so and now my time has come. I shall soon be with him again. If I could only see a child of Johns and Kittys before I go Ild go gladly. If I could only say to him Before I came to you I held Johns and Kittys child in my arms then Ild go gladly. That was what I said to myself that time. But it was Kitty that the banshee meant. And now though I felt then the first time that I was an old woman here I am still and Kitty is gone and the child is grown up to be a woman and she is lost. But she is not dead John she is not dead. Kathleen couldnt die without Ild hear the banshee.It was not once only that John and his mother talked together in some such way as this. It was a dozen times at least perhaps two dozen times that she told him that whatever had come to Kathleen she was not deadthat she could not be dead because the banshee had not moaned and cried about the house as she was sure to do before any one of the OBriens could die. And so John seeing his mother careworn and anxious but never so full of sorrow as himself came to think that he ought to bear it better and not let her see him always so troubled and so sad. Yet he could not believe all that his mother said quite as she believed it and she had to tell him all of it again and again and she told him too that when the time came she meant to try to get Kathleen back from the Good People. And after a while John did not think every time that he heard anybody at the door that it was Kathleen at last and all in the house went on as it had gone before only that Kathleen was not there. But that only was enough and it was a different house.The dreadful spring was past the horrible dull anxious summer was gone the cruel chilly autumn went by the cold dead heartless winter dragged through another spring came cheerless hopeless helpless like the last.Shaun said Mrs. OBrien do you know when it was that Kathleen went awayCould I ever forget said John.When was itIt was May Eve.And what is today JohnIts the last day of April John answered its a year this night shes been away. Could I forget it Dont I think of it all the timeTheres no time in the year Mrs. OBrien said when the Good People have more power than on May Eve.Oh mother said John dont talk to me of the Good People Ive heard too much of them. I dont care if there are any Good People or not. I only know that Kathleen has been from us a year. When her mother died I could bear it because I had Kathleen left but now shes gone and how can I bear itListen to me John his mother went on. Its on May Eve as I told you that the Good People have great power. Its then that they dance and then they make young girls or young men that they want come and dance with them and then they carry them off. But its on May Eve too sometimes that they can be got back by those who know what to do. And so its tonight that we must try to get Kathleen back. I wouldnt tell you till the time came for fear you might hope too much. We may not find her and then we may and you must come with us for we dont know how much help well need.Who is it that I must come with John asked.With me and with the girls that were with Kathleen that night and saw her last.How do we know that they can come said John. Its late in the day now and they may be away from home.Ive taken care of all that Mrs. OBrien said theyll be here in a little while to go with us.In a little while the girls came. Then they and Mrs. OBrien and John went together to the place where Kathleen had met the girls on her way home from the Sullivans a year ago. Was it about this time of the day Mrs. OBrien asked that you met Kathleen here a year ago tonightIt was one of the girls said about this time.Then you must take us Mrs. OBrien went on just the way that you went and show us the very place where Kathleen stood the last instant that you saw her.They all walked along through the Park the girls leading the way. How can they find the very place again said John. Its been a year since then. Its likely they have forgot the spot. How could they remember it so longJohn said his mother will you never trust me Do you think that Ive been waiting for them to forget all this time The very evening after Kathleen was lost they brought me here and then took me to the very spot where they saw her last. They talked of it between themselves and decided just where it was and many a time since theyve been with me here so that they could not forget it.In a few minutes the girls stopped. This is the place where we saw her last they said just here. She stood here and seemed to be looking at something there on the grass.Mrs. OBrien whispered Stand still here all of you and do not speak or stir unless I call to you then do whatever I tell you and do it quickly.Mrs. OBrien drew out something which was hung about her neck by a chain under her gown. She held it before her in her hand. She stepped upon the grass and looked all around her. She went a few steps forward and looked around again. She went a little to the left then a little more to the right. And then to those who were watching it seemed as if she saw something though they could see nothing but her. For she made a few hurried steps and then put out her left hand as if to take hold of something. Then they saw her raise her right hand as if to touch the something that she had taken hold of with what she held in it. Still they could see nothing except her but now she hurried toward them and suddenly they saw that she was leading Kathleen with her left arm around her and holding her right hand against her forehead.Take her and go home with her she said to John as quickly as you can. The rest of us will follow.Oh father said Kathleen I am so glad that you came to meet me Have you and grandmother been worried about me all day I was afraid you would be but the baby needed me and I couldnt send any word to you. And I promised Terence that I would come backnot Terence Sullivan but the Terence that lives in there. Please ask some of the Good People to tell him that I will come back tomorrow. Then I will go home with you.Take her home Take her home her grandmother cried. And John led her away as fast as he could while the rest followed.No one said anything more till they were at home for it was only a little way. Kathleen scarcely looked at her father till they came into the house where it was light. Why father she said what makes you look so queer You look so much older than you did yesterday and youoh I am afraid you were dreadfully worried about me. I didnt think you would besuch a little while. I forgot that you would be worried. There was so much to see there and then I had to take care of the babyand so I forgot. It was very wrong for me to forget and I am so sorry you were anxious about me. But I thought of you and grandmother just as we were coming out to dance tonight and as soon as we were done dancing I was coming home. And why were you all there where we were dancing Did you think that I would be there You ought not to have been afraid father. It was just such a little while.John did not seem to think anything about its being wrong for Kathleen to forget. He did not seem to think of anything but that she had come back. Just a little while do you call it he said. Do you call a year a little while for you to be away from me Kathleen And from your grandmother Dont you see how she has worried about you too all this long year And what could I think but that you was dead Your grandmother never thought so but I could think nothing else.A year Kathleen cried. What do you mean father What do you mean Oh grandmother is there anything wrong Has he been sick What is itBe quiet John said Mrs. OBrien and let me talk with Kathleen. Come here Kathleen. No there is nothing wrong dear. Now listen and answer what I ask you. When did you see your father and me last before tonightWhy you know that grandmother Kathleen answered. I saw father yesterday morning and I saw you yesterday afternoon when I left you to go to the Sullivans.And where have you been since then Mrs. OBrien asked.Kathleen closed her eyes and clasped her hands as she thought of it. Oh it was so wonderful she said. I was inside the hill in the Park. I walked right in there on the water with the Good People. And it was so beautiful thereall gold and silver and jewelsand the musicthe music that Terence played And I must go back. I promised him I would.And how long were you there Mrs. OBrien asked.All the time Kathleen said all night and all day I didnt go anywhere else. And when it was time for them all to come out to dance tonightthey were dancing you know when I first saw them and they asked me to dance with them and then I went into the hill with them. And tonight we came out to dance again and it was only a little while when you came and then I saw father and he brought me home. But I was coming home myself as soon as the dancing was over.Kathleen said Mrs. OBrien listen to me now. Dont be frightened but listen. Youve been away from us for a whole year. It was a year ago this night that you danced with the Good People that first time. All this year you have been with them there in the hill. If we had not gone after you tonight and if I had not known how to bring you back they would have taken you into the hill for another year and you might have stayed there perhaps as long as you lived.But grandmother A year Why you know it was yesterdayYesterday was a year ago her grandmother said. You cant understand it now. Dont try. You must eat something now and then you must go to bed. Tomorrow I can tell you about it better and then perhaps you can understand.But Kathleen could not eat. Her going away had been so strange her coming back had been so wonderful and what her grandmother had told her had been so marvelous that she could think of nothing else. By and by she went to her room. While she was undressing she felt something hard in her pocket. She took it out and it was the little box of ointment that the Queen had given her to put on the babys eyes. Now that she was at home again she felt as if she had dreamed all that she had seen and heard while she was away. But she had not dreamed it. Here was this little gold box to prove it. Yet she could not believe it. And they told her that she had been away for a year What they said must be a dream too. But here was the little gold box just as the Queen had given it to her. It was a green salve that was in it. She would open it and see if there really was a green salve. If there was then it was not a dream.She opened it. There was the green salve. Yes it was exactly as she remembered it. And she could remember it all so well. She remembered how the Queen had given it to her and surely that was last night. She remembered how she had touched the babys eyes with the salve and how much brighter they had looked after she had done it. Surely it was only this morning that she did that. It seemed to her all so plain. And they said that it had been a year. She could not understand it at all. She laid the little gold box on her bureau under her glass and went to bed.The next morning Kathleen could think about things a little more clearly. She could not remember what she had seen and heard in the hill quite so distinctly. She had not forgotten anything but it all seemed dimmer in her mind than it had been as if it were long ago. And still it seemed as if it had all happened yesterday. Everybody whom she knew had heard that she was at home again and everybody came to see her. And they all told her that she had been away for a year. She could not doubt it any longer and yet she could not understand it. What had she been doing all that time She could remember just enough to fill up one night and one day and that was all. Could it be that she had slept for three hundred and sixtyfour days and been awake for only one No she could not believe that. And so at last she came to her grandmother to ask if she could explain it to her.No the old woman said I cant do that. Its too wonderful for any of us to understand. But its no more wonderful than many things that are true and Ive heard tales of it before. Often one stays in the land of the Good People and in other places too and thinks that the time has been short when it has been long. Shall I tell you what happened once to a monka holy manmuch more wonderful than what happened to youOne day this monk was in the garden of the monastery where he lived reading in his book. He was reading in the Psalms where it says For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday which is past. And as a watch in the night things that are counted nothing shall their years be.And he found it hard to believe that even to God Himself a thousand years could seem no more than a day. As he was thinking of this a bird in a tree near him began to sing and the song was so beautiful that he forgot the psalm that he had been reading and his thoughts about it and only listened to the bird. It seemed to him that in all his life he had never heard any music so beautiful.But soon the bird flew to another tree farther from the monastery and the monk followed to listen to its song again. Then the bird flew to a tree farther off and still the monk followed. Once more the bird flew to another tree and once more the monk followed it for it seemed to him that as long as that bird sang he could listen to nothing else and could think of nothing else. But he saw that the sun had gone down and he knew that it was time for him to go back to the monastery. As he went back he looked at the colors that the sun had left behind it in the sky and he thought that they were as beautiful to see as the voice of the bird was to hear.They were all faded and the darkness had come on when he reached the monastery and went in. And if he had wondered at the song of the bird and at the colors in the sky he wondered yet more when he found himself again in the place where he had lived for many years. For many things about the place were changed and the men in it were all changed. There was not one face among them that he knew. One of the brothers saw him and came toward him and he said Brother why have all these changes been made here since this morning And who are all these whom I do not know I scarcely know my own monastery.And the other answered Who are you that ask this and why do you come here For you wear the dress of our order but you are a stranger. You speak as if you knew the place yet I myself have lived here for fifty years and I have never seen you before.Then the monk told his name and told how he had been at mass in the chapel in the morning and had then gone into the garden to read. And he told how he had read in the Psalms A thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday which is past and how while he was thinking of these words he had heard the bird singing. He told how he had followed the bird till he saw that night was coming and then had come back to the monastery.And the other said I remember now that when I first came into this place they told me of a legend that a monk of your name had gone out of this monastery a hundred and fifty years before and had never come back and had never been heard of again. And now counting my own fifty years here that must have been two hundred years ago.Then the monk said God has given me such happiness as He gives to few until they are with Him in Heaven for these two hundred years have seemed to me to be only a part of a day. Now hear my confession for I know that I soon shall die.So the other monk heard his confession and before midnight he died. And this was the way that God had chosen to show him the meaning of His word.It was a pretty story but Kathleen understood no more than before. No said her grandmother you cannot understand and I cannot. We live here such a little while and we are so shut in by time that we cannot understand how it is with those who live always. But we shall understand when the right time comes and then we shall wonder how we could ever wonder. And I will tell you another story about it not to make you understand but to show you how it is.Long ago Finn McCool was the great champion of Ireland. He had many warriors who were called Fenians. He had a son Oisin who was a great warrior too and besides that a poet and a minstrel. Some of his poems are left to us yet. One day the Fenians were hunting when they met a beautiful girl riding on a white horse. She called to Oisin and he went apart from the others to speak with her.She told him that she was the Princess of TirnanOge and that she had come to take him there where she was to be married to him. TirnanOge means Land of the Young and they say that nobody ever grows old there. The Princess was as beautiful as moonlight and her voice was as sweet as the wind blowing on a harp and Oisin was in love with her and eager to go before she had done speaking.He went back to his father and his companions and bade them farewell. It was with tears that Finn said goodby to Oisin for I think he knew that he should never see him again. But Oisin did not know. Then Oisin mounted the white horse and set the Princess in front of him and the horse galloped away toward the west. In a little while they came to the sea and the horse kept straight on galloping over the water as if it had been a smooth road. Then some say that the water rose around them and covered them and that they were in a beautiful place under the sea. I am not sure of that. Lands there are under the sea they say and no doubt there are but I am not so sure that the real TirnanOge is there.For others say that the tops of blue hills rose before them and changed to green as they came nearer and then Oisin saw that soft grass sloped down to the very water here and there and in other places there were tall cliffs and trailing vines hung down from the tops of them covered with bright flowers and they swung to and fro in the light breeze. Beyond there were more hills covered with rich woods. Little veils of mist hid them partly and made them more beautiful and streams poured down from high places and looked like thin silky tassels hung upon the hills and they waved in the air like the waving vines and some of them seemed never to reach the ground at all but to blow away into fine silver spray and to mix with the mists of the hills. And golden sunlight poured down over it all and there was a warm shimmer in the air that made it all look like something seen in a dream. And this was TirnanOge.The horse came to the shore and galloped over soft turf till it seemed to Oisin that they were in the very middle of the island and there they came to a palace and Oisin thought that it was more beautiful than anything else that he had seen. It may be that the palace was built of marble but to Oisin it seemed like blocks of pure snow. It was so long that one might well mount his horse to go the length of it instead of walking. It had gilded domes that looked like suns with the light shining on them and the whole palace was dazzling to look at. All around it were gardens with trees and plants in full bloom of all the colors of the rainbow and colors that are not in the rainbow and other trees with only deep green leaves and pathways among them which led down into cool shady hollows with clear brooks running through them between banks of soft darkgreen moss sinking their quiet little song.Oisin got down off his horse and then lifted the Princess down and they went into the palace. There the Princesss father the King of TirnanOge made Oisin welcome and led both of them to the banquet hall where a great feast was spread in honor of the Princess and the new Prince. And Oisin thought that if the palace was beautiful outside it was much more beautiful inside and as for the table that was before him he could not think of any of the best things in the world to eat and to drink that were not on it.The next day the Princess was married to Oisin. For a long time Oisin and the Princess lived in the palace and Oisin thought that he never could be more happy than he was now. The old warriors cared much for what they ate and drank and Oisin ate and drank better things than he had ever tasted before. He walked with the Princess down through the shady ways among the trees and across the brooks and up the hillsides among the flowers. They sat together in the garden or in the palace and she sang to him and told him wonderful tales of heroes and of princesses of olden times. Sometimes they rode hunting together and everywhere they found game the finest that Oisin had ever seen.But at last Oisin began to feel that he cared less for all these things than he had done at first. The grass and the flowers and the woods did not seem so fair to him as they had seemed the sunshine was not such pure gold he wished that the silver streams would not blow away in spray and mix with the mists he wanted to see them come down yellow with the earth of the mountains and plunge into caverns with great rushing and roaring he felt that the warm air was taking his strength from him he no longer liked the rich feasts that were spread before him every day he longed to follow the deer through the woods with his old friends to kill it and to cook it and eat it in the woods and then to sleep there under the trees and the stars these trees and these gardens were beautiful it was true but they were too beautiful a hard way through a rough forest would have pleased him better now he did not love the Princess less but he longed to see his father and his men again her singing was no less sweet to him than it had ever been before but he wished that he could be again where the Fenians after a hard days hunt or a hard days fight sat about the fire in their stronghold and listened to one of themperhaps himself for he was the best singer of them allwhile he sang songs of great heroes and of great fights.And one day when the Princess had been singing to him he took her harp from her and sang a song of one of his fathers battles a battle which he had seen himself where Diarmuid had slain hundreds and Orcur had slain hundreds and Erin had been kept from her enemies. Then he said to the Princess Do not think that I am ungrateful for all the happiness that I have had here but I am longing to see Erin again and to see my father and his men. It is not so beautiful a land as this but it is my own land and I am longing to see it. The air here is sweet and the sunshine is warm but I should like to breathe the mists and to feel the chill again if I could only see Erin once moreMrs. OBrien stopped a moment with the way that she had of seeming to look at things far off. Kathleen said nothing when she paused in this way and in a minute the old woman went onYou would not be so happy in Erin as you think the Princess answered him. This is the best place for you to stay and it would break my heart for you to go.So Oisin said no more then but the great longing grew upon him and every day the delights of TirnanOge pleased him less. And at last he spoke of it again and asked the Princess to let him go for a little while. You would find Erin changed she said and the Fenians are all gone. How long have you been here with meI cannot tell you to a day Oisin answered but I know that it is weeks since I saw my country and my people.You have been here said the Princess for three hundred years.Oisin could not understand it but he thought that if he could live so long and not know that the time had passed the Fenians too might be living still and he begged again to be allowed to go. At last the Princess saw that he would never be happy unless he went so she brought him the same white horse that had brought them both to TirnanOge. The horse she said will take you to Erin. But you must sit upon his back and never loose his bridle or get down upon the ground. If you touch the ground of Erin you will be at once a weak old man you can never come back to TirnanOge you will never see me and I shall never see you again. Will you promise me if I will let you go that you will not get off the horses back or let go his bridleOisin promised and she let him go. Away over the water the horse galloped again. TirnanOge with its warm sun and its sweet air was left behind. A damp seawind came up and it blew the salt spray harshly into Oisins face as the horse dashed along. It was a joy to him. No more of the soft comforts of that weary island. This was something for a man to face. Yet he did not forget the Princess and he meant to go back to her when he had seen his land and his people once more. Then the clouds and the fog drifted away and the sun shone out but still the salt spray covered him and he felt stronger as he made his way against it and felt the great free breeze from the east. And now he saw something like a little cloud on the horizon and it rose higher and grew wider and then its misty brown faded away and he saw the beautiful green shores of Erin.The old woman paused again and said over softly to herself The beautifulbeautiful green shores of Erin.The horse and the rider soon reached the land now. Oisin rode first to the spot where he had first met the Princess of TirnanOge and where he had last seen his father and his companions. He did not think to find them there but he felt that it was the first place to which he should go. The forest had been cleared away a little and a strange building stood there. It was a small house built of stone and there was a cross on the top of it. Inside he heard a sound of singing. He rode to the door and looked in. There were people kneeling before a man who stood in a higher place than the rest and held up a golden cup.This was something that Oisin did not understand and he rode away remembering what the Princess had told him that he would find Ireland changed. He wondered if he had been wise to come at all. But he went on and now he rode fast in this direction and in that to try to find the Fenians. Sometimes he asked people whom he met if they could tell him of his father. Some of them shook their heads and said that they knew no such person as Finn McCool. Others laughed at him. One or two old men told him that the Fenians had all died long ago and that the man of greatest power in Ireland now was Patrick. It was hard for him to believe. He would have thought himself in a dream but a dream seems right and true while it lasts and this seemed all wrong and false. Yet when he found a place that he knew and looked for some familiar stronghold of the Fenians he found only a low mound of earth grown all over with grass or perhaps with weeds and bushes. And everywhere he saw these houses of stone with crosses on their tops.Then it came into his mind to find this Patrick of whom he heard so much and to see what sort of man was now the greatest in Ireland. This was an easier matter than searching for the Fenians. Everyone knew where the holy Patrick was and soon Oisin came near the place and found that the saint was building another of the stone houses. As Oisin came near he saw some men trying to lift a heavy stone upon a car to take it to the new building. It almost made him laugh to see how small and weak the men were. He knew well that he could put the stone on the car alone. It was no larger than the stones that the Fenians used to throw for sport.He came near and leaned down from his saddle to lift the stone for the men. He took hold of it and began to raise it but with the weight the girth of his saddle broke the saddle slipped around on the horse Oisin fell and the horse ran away. Oisin lay there on the ground of Erin which the Princess had forbidden him to touch an old man weak helpless blind hollowcheeked wrinkled whitehaired.The men took him up and carried him to St. Patrick who welcomed him kindly and kept him for a while in his own house. Many times the saint talked with him and tried to make him a Christian but Oisin could think of nothing but the grand days of the Fenians. When St. Patrick talked with him he would begin to tell of these and he would make the poems about them that have been kept till now and give us what we know of Finn McCool and his heroes. And these poems Patrick would have written down. And always Oisin was mourning for the brave old days of Finn McCool or for the days of TirnanOge which seemed to him now still farther off.Old as he was now with the heavy weight of more than three hundred years upon him blind and weak there was one thing in which Oisin felt himself a better man that St. Patrick or any of his band. St. Patrick and all those who were with him fasted much and when they ate it was frugally of bread and the herbs of the field and but little meat. But this was not enough for Oisin. He remembered how he and his fellowhuntsmen used to follow the deer and kill it and dress it and cook it on the moor in the fresh cool evening and feast till it was time to sleep and then wake and follow the deer again. And so the food which was given to him in St. Patricks house seemed poor and scanty to him.He said this to the cook and others in the house and they made sport of him because so old a man as he should wish to eat so much. Then he told them tales of the days of his father how great and strong the men of Erin were then how much more fertile the land was and of the great beasts and the great trees and plants and vines that it brought forth. In those days he said the leg of a lark was as large as a leg of mutton now a berry of the wild ash was as large as a sheep and an ivy leaf as broad as a shield.They all laughed at him the more when he said these things and they did not believe a word of it all. Alas he said how can I show you that what I say is true The dear heroes whom I knew are all gone. I am left alone to mourn for them among men who do not even believe how great they were. Everything that I have found is changed but there may be something that is not changed. Will one of you go with me in a war chariot and drive where I shall tell him and let me see if I can find anything as I knew it onceThen one of them said that he would go with him. The next morning they set out. Oisin told the man where to drive till they came to a place where Oisin said Look around you and tell me what you can see on the plain.I see a stone pillar the man answered.Drive the chariot to it said Oisin and dig at the foot of the pillar on the south side of it.The man did as Oisin told him and when he had dug for a while Oisin asked him if he had found anything. There is something long and hard here said the man like a wooden pole.Dig it out said Oisin.The man dug more. I have it out now he said it is like a great spear for it has a huge head of rusty iron. I can scarcely lift it.It is a spear such as the Fenians used said Oisin. Dig still deeper.The man dug again. Do you find anything more said Oisin.I have found a great horn the man answered many times as large as any horn that I ever saw.It is the great warhorn of my father Finn McCool said Oisin. Dig deeper.The man dug again and said I have found a lump of bog butter.Now blow the horn said Oisin.The man was scarcely able to blow the horn but he did blow it and it gave forth a harsh terrible note which sounded over the plain and was echoed back from the woods and the rocks with a hoarse dreadful sound.Look about you said Oisin and tell me what you see.Oh I see said the man a great flock of birds coming toward us and every one of them is many times as large as the largest eagle that I have ever seen. I fear that we cannot escape them and that they will kill us. The dog is nearly dead with terror and he is trying to break his chain.Give him a piece of the bog butter said Oisin and let him go. Then tell me what he does.He is running straight toward the birds the man answered and they are coming straight toward him and toward us along the ground. Ah he has caught one of them and all the rest have flown away He has killed the bird He is rushing back to us with madness in his eyes and his mouth covered with blood and foam I fear that he will be worse for us than the birds would have been.Hold the spear straight in front of you as he comes said Oisin and let him run upon the point of it and kill him.The man held the spear as Oisin told him and when the dog came on he was caught upon the point of it and it went through his heart and he fell dead.Then the man went and cut off one of the legs of the bird which had been killed and they took it with them and started back. As they went they passed a mountain ash which had berries of enormous size and the man put one of them into the chariot. Then the man saw huge ivy leaves and he took one of them too. So they went back to St. Patricks house and showed all the men there what they had brought. The leg of the bird and the berry and the ivy leaf were even larger than Oisin had said. And after that they all believed the stories that Oisin told them and all of them agreed that a man who had lived in the days when there were such trees and such beasts and such men in Erin should be his own judge as to how much he needed to eat. And so after that all of St. Patricks men treated him as well as did St. Patrick himself.But Oisin died only a little while after that the last of the great heroes of Erin. He had lived for more than three hundred years and it seemed to him no more than the life of a young man.
And what happened next my children whether it be true or not stands written in ancient songs which you shall read for yourselves some day. And grand old songs they are written in grand old rolling verse and they call them the Songs of Orpheus or the Orphics to this day. And they tell how the heroes came to Aphetai across the bay and waited for the southwest wind and chose themselves a captain from their crew and how all called for Heracles because he was the strongest and most huge but Heracles refused and called for Jason because he was the wisest of them all. So Jason was chosen captain and Orpheus heaped a pile of wood and slew a bull and offered it to Hera and called all the heroes to stand round each mans head crowned with olive and to strike their swords into the bull. Then he filled a golden goblet with the bulls blood and with wheaten flour and honey and wine and the bitter saltsea water and bade the heroes taste. So each tasted the goblet and passed it round and vowed an awful vow and they vowed before the sun and the night and the bluehaired sea who shakes the land to stand by Jason faithfully in the adventure of the golden fleece and whosoever shrank back or disobeyed or turned traitor to his vow then justice should minister against him and the Erinnues who track guilty men.Then Jason lighted the pile and burnt the carcase of the bull and they went to their ship and sailed eastward like men who have a work to do and the place from which they went was called Aphetai the sailingplace from that day forth. Three thousand years and more they sailed away into the unknown Eastern seas and great nations have come and gone since then and many a storm has swept the earth and many a mighty armament to which Argo would be but one small boat English and French Turkish and Russian have sailed those waters since yet the fame of that small Argo lives forever and her name is become a proverb among men.So they sailed past the Isle of Sciathos with the Cape of Sepius on their left and turned to the northward toward Pelion up the long Magnesian shore. On their right hand was the open sea and on their left old Pelion rose while the clouds crawled round his dark pineforests and his caps of summer snow. And their hearts yearned for the dear old mountain as they thought of pleasant days gone by and of the sports of their boyhood and their hunting and their schooling in the cave beneath the cliff. And at last Peleus spokeLet us land here friends and climb the dear old hill once more. We are going on a fearful journey who knows if we shall see Pelion again Let us go up to Cheiron our master and ask his blessing ere we start. And I have a boy too with him whom he trains as he trained me once the son whom Thetis brought me the silverfooted lady of the sea whom I caught in the cave and tamed her though she changed her shape seven times. For she changed as I held her into water and to vapour and to burning flame and to a rock and to a blackmaned lion and to a tall and stately tree. But I held her and held her ever till she took her own shape again and led her to my fathers house and won her for my bride. And all the rulers of Olympus came to our wedding and the heavens and the earth rejoiced together when an immortal wedded mortal man. And now let me see my son for it is not often I shall see him upon earth famous he will be but shortlived and die in the flower of youth.So Tiphys the helmsman steered them to the shore under the crags of Pelion and they went up through the dark pineforests towards the Centaurs cave.And they came into the misty hall beneath the snowcrowned crag and saw the great Centaur lying with his huge limbs spread upon the rock and beside him stood Achilles the child whom no steel could wound and played upon his harp right sweetly while Cheiron watched and smiled.Then Cheiron leapt up and welcomed them and kissed them every one and set a feast before them of swines flesh and venison and good wine and young Achilles served them and carried the golden goblet round. And after supper all the heroes clapped their hands and called on Orpheus to sing but he refused and said How can I who am the younger sing before our ancient host So they called on Cheiron to sing and Achilles brought him his harp and he began a wondrous songa famous story of old time of the fight between the Centaurs and the Lapithai which you may still see carved in stone. He sang how his brothers came to ruin by their folly when they were mad with wine and how they and the heroes fought with fists and teeth and the goblets from which they drank and how they tore up the pinetrees in their fury and hurled great crags of stone while the mountains thundered with the battle and the land was wasted far and wide till the Lapithai drove them from their home in the rich Thessalian plains to the lonely glens of Pindus leaving Cheiron all alone. And the heroes praised his song right heartily for some of them had helped in that great fight.Then Orpheus took the lyre and sang of Chaos and the making of the wondrous World and how all things sprang from Love who could not live alone in the Abyss. And as he sang his voice rose from the cave above the crags and through the treetops and the glens of oak and pine. And the trees bowed their heads when they heard it and the grey rocks cracked and rang and the forest beasts crept near to listen and the birds forsook their nests and hovered round. And old Cheiron clapt his hands together and beat his hoofs upon the ground for wonder at that magic song.Then Peleus kissed his boy and wept over him and they went down to the ship and Cheiron came down with them weeping and kissed them one by one and blest them and promised to them great renown. And the heroes wept when they left him till their great hearts could weep no more for he was kind and just and pious and wiser than all beasts and men. Then he went up to a cliff and prayed for them that they might come home safe and well while the heroes rowed away and watched him standing on his cliff above the sea with his great hands raised toward heaven and his white locks waving in the wind and they strained their eyes to watch him to the last for they felt that they should look on him no more.So they rowed on over the long swell of the sea past Olympus the seat of the immortals and past the wooded bays of Athos and Samothrace the sacred isle and they came past Lemnos to the Hellespont and through the narrow strait of Abydos and so on into the Propontis which we call Marmora now. And there they met with Cyzicus ruling in Asia over the Dolions who the songs say was the son of neas of whom you will hear many a tale some day. For Homer tells us how he fought at Troy and Virgil how he sailed away and founded Rome and men believed until late years that from him sprang our old British kings. Now Cyzicus the songs say welcomed the heroes for his father had been one of Cheirons scholars so he welcomed them and feasted them and stored their ship with corn and wine and cloaks and rugs the songs say and shirts of which no doubt they stood in need.But at night while they lay sleeping came down on them terrible men who lived with the bears in the mountains like Titans or giants in shape for each of them had six arms and they fought with young firs and pines. But Heracles killed them all before morn with his deadly poisoned arrows but among them in the darkness he slew Cyzicus the kindly prince.Then they got to their ship and to their oars and Tiphys bade them cast off the hawsers and go to sea. But as he spoke a whirlwind came and spun the Argo round and twisted the hawsers together so that no man could loose them. Then Tiphys dropped the rudder from his hand and cried This comes from the Gods above. But Jason went forward and asked counsel of the magic bough.Then the magic bough spoke and answeredThis is because you have slain Cyzicus your friend. You must appease his soul or you will never leave this shore.Jason went back sadly and told the heroes what he had heard. And they leapt on shore and searched till dawn and at dawn they found the body all rolled in dust and blood among the corpses of those monstrous beasts. And they wept over their kind host and laid him on a fair bed and heaped a huge mound over him and offered black sheep at his tomb and Orpheus sang a magic song to him that his spirit might have rest. And then they held games at the tomb after the custom of those times and Jason gave prizes to each winner. To Ancus he gave a golden cup for he wrestled best of all and to Heracles a silver one for he was the strongest of all and to Castor who rode best a golden crest and Polydeuces the boxer had a rich carpet and to Orpheus for his song a sandal with golden wings. But Jason himself was the best of all the archers and the Minuai crowned him with an olive crown and so the songs say the soul of good Cyzicus was appeased and the heroes went on their way in peace.But when Cyzicuss wife heard that he was dead she died likewise of grief and her tears became a fountain of clear water which flows the whole year round.Then they rowed away the songs say along the Mysian shore and past the mouth of Rhindacus till they found a pleasant bay sheltered by the long ridges of Arganthus and by high walls of basalt rock. And there they ran the ship ashore upon the yellow sand and furled the sail and took the mast down and lashed it in its crutch. And next they let down the ladder and went ashore to sport and rest.And there Heracles went away into the woods bow in hand to hunt wild deer and Hylas the fair boy slipt away after him and followed him by stealth until he lost himself among the glens and sat down weary to rest himself by the side of a lake and there the water nymphs came up to look at him and loved him and carried him down under the lake to be their playfellow forever happy and young. And Heracles sought for him in vain shouting his name till all the mountains rang but Hylas never heard him far down under the sparkling lake. So while Heracles wandered searching for him a fair breeze sprang up and Heracles was nowhere to be found and the Argo sailed away and Heracles was left behind and never saw the noble Phasian stream.Then the Minuai came to a doleful land where Amycus the giant ruled and cared nothing for the laws of Zeus but challenged all strangers to box with him and those whom he conquered he slew. But Polydeuces the boxer struck him a harder blow than he ever felt before and slew him and the Minuai went on up the Bosphorus till they came to the city of Phineus the fierce Bithynian king for Zetes and Calais bade Jason land there because they had a work to do.And they went up from the shore toward the city through forests white with snow and Phineus came out to meet them with a lean and woful face and said Welcome gallant heroes to the land of bitter blasts a land of cold and misery yet I will feast you as best I can. And he led them in and set meat before them but before they could put their hands to their mouths down came two fearful monsters the like of whom man never saw for they had the faces and the hair of fair maidens but the wings and claws of hawks and they snatched the meat from off the table and flew shrieking out above the roofs.Then Phineus beat his breast and cried These are the Harpies whose names are the Whirlwind and the Swift the daughters of Wonder and of the Ambernymph and they rob us night and day. They carried off the daughters of Pandareus whom all the Gods had blest for Aphrodite fed them on Olympus with honey and milk and wine and Hera gave them beauty and wisdom and Athene skill in all the arts but when they came to their wedding the Harpies snatched them both away and gave them to be slaves to the Erinnues and live in horror all their days. And now they haunt me and my people and the Bosphorus with fearful storms and sweep away our food from off our tables so that we starve in spite of all our wealth.Then up rose Zetes and Calais the winged sons of the Northwind and said Do you not know us Phineus and these wings which grow upon our backs And Phineus hid his face in terror but he answered not a word.Because you have been a traitor Phineus the Harpies haunt you night and day. Where is Cleopatra our sister your wife whom you keep in prison and where are her two children whom you blinded in your rage at the bidding of an evil woman and cast them out upon the rocks Swear to us that you will right our sister and cast out that wicked woman and then we will free you from your plague and drive the whirlwind maidens from the south but if not we will put out your eyes as you put out the eyes of your own sons.Then Phineus swore an oath to them and drove out the wicked woman and Jason took those two poor children and cured their eyes with magic herbs.But Zetes and Calais rose up sadly and said Farewell now heroes all farewell our dear companions with whom we played on Pelion in old times for a fate is laid upon us and our day is come at last in which we must hunt the whirlwinds over land and sea forever and if we catch them they die and if not we die ourselves.At that all the heroes wept but the two young men sprang up and aloft into the air after the Harpies and the battle of the winds began.The heroes trembled in silence as they heard the shrieking of the blasts while the palace rocked and all the city and great stones were torn from the crags and the forestpines were hurled earthward north and south and east and west and the Bosphorus boiled white with foam and the clouds were dashed against the cliffs.But at last the battle ended and the Harpies fled screaming toward the south and the sons of the Northwind rushed after them and brought clear sunshine where they passed. For many a league they followed them over all the isles of the Cyclades and away to the southwest across Hellas till they came to the Ionian Sea and there they fell upon the Echinades at the mouth of the Achelous and those isles were called the Whirlwind Isles for many a hundred years. But what became of Zetes and Calais I know not for the heroes never saw them again and some say that Heracles met them and quarrelled with them and slew them with his arrows and some say that they fell down from weariness and the heat of the summer sun and that the Sungod buried them among the Cyclades in the pleasant Isle of Tenos and for many hundred years their grave was shown there and over it a pillar which turned to every wind. But those dark storms and whirlwinds haunt the Bosphorus until this day.But the Argonauts went eastward and out into the open sea which we now call the Black Sea but it was called the Euxine then. No Hellen had ever crossed it and all feared that dreadful sea and its rocks and shoals and fogs and bitter freezing storms and they told strange stories of it some false and some half true how it stretched northward to the ends of the earth and the sluggish Putrid Sea and the everlasting night and the regions of the dead. So the heroes trembled for all their courage as they came into that wild Black Sea and saw it stretching out before them without a shore as far as eye could see.And first Orpheus spoke and warned themWe shall come now to the wandering blue rocks my mother warned me of them Calliope the immortal muse.And soon they saw the blue rocks shining like spires and castles of grey glass while an icecold wind blew from them and chilled all the heroes hearts. And as they neared they could see them heaving as they rolled upon the long seawaves crashing and grinding together till the roar went up to heaven. The sea sprang up in spouts between them and swept round them in white sheets of foam but their heads swung nodding high in air while the wind whistled shrill among the crags.The heroes hearts sank within them and they lay upon their oars in fear but Orpheus called to Tiphys the helmsman Between them we must pass so look ahead for an opening and be brave for Hera is with us. But Tiphys the cunning helmsman stood silent clenching his teeth till he saw a heron come flying masthigh toward the rocks and hover awhile before them as if looking for a passage through. Then he cried Hera has sent us a pilot let us follow the cunning bird.Then the heron flapped to and fro a moment till he saw a hidden gap and into it he rushed like an arrow while the heroes watched what would befall.And the blue rocks clashed together as the bird fled swiftly through but they struck but a feather from his tail and then rebounded apart at the shock.Then Tiphys cheered the heroes and they shouted and the oars bent like withes beneath their strokes as they rushed between those toppling icecrags and the cold blue lips of death. And ere the rocks could meet again they had passed them and were safe out in the open sea.And after that they sailed on wearily along the Asian coast by the Black Cape and Thyneis where the hot stream of Thymbris falls into the sea and Sangarius whose waters float on the Euxine till they came to Wolf the river and to Wolf the kindly king. And there died two brave heroes Idmon and Tiphys the wise helmsman one died of an evil sickness and one a wild boar slew. So the heroes heaped a mound above them and set upon it an oar on high and left them there to sleep together on the faroff Lycian shore. But Idas killed the boar and avenged Tiphys and Ancaios took the rudder and was helmsman and steered them on toward the east.And they went on past Sinope and many a mighty rivers mouth and past many a barbarous tribe and the cities of the Amazons the warlike women of the East till all night they heard the clank of anvils and the roar of furnaceblasts and the forgefires shone like sparks through the darkness in the mountain glens aloft for they were come to the shores of the Chalybes the smiths who never tire but serve Ares the cruel Wargod forging weapons day and night.And at daydawn they looked eastward and midway between the sea and the sky they saw white snowpeaks hanging glittering sharp and bright above the clouds. And they knew that they were come to Caucasus at the end of all the earth Caucasus the highest of all mountains the father of the rivers of the East. On his peak lies chained the Titan while a vulture tears his heart and at his feet are piled dark forests round the magic Colchian land.And they rowed three days to the eastward while Caucasus rose higher hour by hour till they saw the dark stream of Phasis rushing headlong to the sea and shining above the treetops the golden roofs of King Aietes the child of the Sun.Then out spoke Ancaios the helmsman We are come to our goal at last for there are the roofs of Aietes and the woods where all poisons grow but who can tell us where among them is hid the golden fleece Many a toil must we bear ere we find it and bring it home to Greece.But Jason cheered the heroes for his heart was high and bold and he said I will go alone up to Aietes though he be the child of the Sun and win him with soft words. Better so than to go altogether and to come to blows at once. But the Minuai would not stay behind so they rowed boldly up the stream.And a dream came to Aietes and filled his heart with fear. He thought he saw a shining star which fell into his daughters lap and that Medeia his daughter took it gladly and carried it to the riverside and cast it in and there the whirling river bore it down and out into the Euxine Sea.Then he leapt up in fear and bade his servants bring his chariot that he might go down to the riverside and appease the nymphs and the heroes whose spirits haunt the bank. So he went down in his golden chariot and his daughters by his side Medeia the fair witchmaiden and Chalciope who had been Phrixuss wife and behind him a crowd of servants and soldiers for he was a rich and mighty prince.And as he drove down by the reedy river he saw Argo sliding up beneath the bank and many a hero in her like immortals for beauty and for strength as their weapons glittered round them in the level morning sunlight through the white mist of the stream. But Jason was the noblest of all for Hera who loved him gave him beauty and tallness and terrible manhood. And when they came near together and looked into each others eyes the heroes were awed before Aietes as he shone in his chariot like his father the glorious Sun for his robes were of rich gold tissue and the rays of his diadem flashed fire and in his hand he bore a jewelled sceptre which glittered like the stars and sternly he looked at them under his brows and sternly he spoke and loudWho are you and what want you here that you come to the shore of Cutaia Do you take no account of my rule nor of my people the Colchians who serve me who never tired yet in the battle and know well how to face an invaderAnd the heroes sat silent awhile before the face of that ancient king. But Hera the awful goddess put courage into Jasons heart and he rose and shouted loudly in answer We are no pirates nor lawless men. We come not to plunder and to ravage or carry away slaves from your land but my uncle the son of Poseidon Pelias the Minuan king he it is who has set me on a quest to bring home the golden fleece. And these too my bold comrades they are no nameless men for some are the sons of immortals and some of heroes far renowned. And we too never tire in battle and know well how to give blows and to take yet we wish to be guests at your table it will be better so for both.Then Aietess rage rushed up like a whirlwind and his eyes flashed fire as he heard but he crushed his anger down in his breast and spoke mildly a cunning speechIf you will fight for the fleece with my Colchians then many a man must die. But do you indeed expect to win from me the fleece in fight So few you are that if you be worsted I can load your ship with your corpses. But if you will be ruled by me you will find it better far to choose the best man among you and let him fulfil the labours which I demand. Then I will give him the golden fleece for a prize and a glory to you all.So saying he turned his horses and drove back in silence to the town. And the Minuai sat silent with sorrow and longed for Heracles and his strength for there was no facing the thousands of the Colchians and the fearful chance of war.But Chalciope Phrixuss widow went weeping to the town for she remembered her Minuan husband and all the pleasures of her youth while she watched the fair faces of his kinsmen and their long locks of golden hair. And she whispered to Medeia her sisterWhy should all these brave men die why does not my father give them up the fleece that my husbands spirit may have restAnd Medeias heart pitied the heroes and Jason most of all and she answered Our father is stern and terrible and who can win the golden fleece But Chalciope said These men are not like our men there is nothing which they cannot dare nor do.And Medeia thought of Jason and his brave countenance and said If there was one among them who knew no fear I could show him how to win the fleece.So in the dusk of evening they went down to the riverside Chalciope and Medeia the witchmaiden and Argus Phrixuss son. And Argus the boy crept forward among the beds of reeds till he came where the heroes were sleeping on the thwarts of the ship beneath the bank while Jason kept ward on shore and leant upon his lance full of thought. And the boy came to Jason and saidI am the son of Phrixus your cousin and Chalciope my mother waits for you to talk about the golden fleece.Then Jason went boldly with the boy and found the two princesses standing and when Chalciope saw him she wept and took his hands and criedO cousin of my beloved go home before you dieIt would be base to go home now fair princess and to have sailed all these seas in vain. Then both the princesses besought him but Jason said It is too late.But you know not said Medeia what he must do who would win the fleece. He must tame the two brazenfooted bulls who breathe devouring flame and with them he must plough ere nightfall four acres in the field of Ares and he must sow them with serpents teeth of which each tooth springs up into an armed man. Then he must fight with all those warriors and little will it profit him to conquer them for the fleece is guarded by a serpent more huge than any mountain pine and over his body you must step if you would reach the golden fleece.Then Jason laughed bitterly. Unjustly is that fleece kept here and by an unjust and lawless king and unjustly shall I die in my youth for I will attempt it ere another sun be set.Then Medeia trembled and said No mortal man can reach that fleece unless I guide him through. For round it beyond the river is a wall full nine ells high with lofty towers and buttresses and mighty gates of threefold brass and over the gates the wall is arched with golden battlements above. And over the gateway sits Brimo the wild witchhuntress of the woods brandishing a pinetorch in her hands while her mad hounds howl around. No man dare meet her or look on her but only I her priestess and she watches far and wide lest any stranger should come near.No wall so high but it may be climbed at last and no wood so thick but it may be crawled through no serpent so wary but he may be charmed or witchqueen so fierce but spells may soothe her and I may yet win the golden fleece if a wise maiden help bold men.And he looked at Medeia cunningly and held her with his glittering eye till she blushed and trembled and saidWho can face the fire of the bulls breath and fight ten thousand armed menHe whom you help said Jason flattering her for your fame is spread over all the earth. Are you not the queen of all enchantresses wiser even than your sister Circe in her fairy island in the WestWould that I were with my sister Circe in her fairy island in the West far away from sore temptation and thoughts which tear the heart But if it must be sofor why should you dieI have an ointment here I made it from the magic iceflower which sprang from Prometheus wound above the clouds on Caucasus in the dreary fields of snow. Anoint yourself with that and you shall have in you seven mens strength and anoint your shield with it and neither fire nor sword can harm you. But what you begin you must end before sunset for its virtue lasts only one day. And anoint your helmet with it before you sow the serpents teeth and when the sons of earth spring up cast your helmet among their ranks and the deadly crop of the Wargods field will mow itself and perish.Then Jason fell on his knees before her and thanked her and kissed her hands and she gave him the vase of ointment and fled trembling through the reeds. And Jason told his comrades what had happened and showed them the box of ointment and all rejoiced but Idas and he grew mad with envy.And at sunrise Jason went and bathed and anointed himself from head to foot and his shield and his helmet and his weapons and bade his comrades try the spell. So they tried to bend his lance but it stood like an iron bar and Idas in spite hewed at it with his sword but the blade flew to splinters in his face. Then they hurled their lances at his shield but the spearpoints turned like lead and Caineus tried to throw him but he never stirred a foot and Polydeuces struck him with his fist a blow which would have killed an ox but Jason only smiled and the heroes danced about him with delight and he leapt and ran and shouted in the joy of that enormous strength till the sun rose and it was time to go and to claim Aietess promise.So he sent up Telamon and Aithalides to tell Aietes that he was ready for the fight and they went up among the marble walls and beneath the roofs of gold and stood in Aietess hall while he grew pale with rage.Fulfil your promise to us child of the blazing sun. Give us the serpents teeth and let loose the fiery bulls for we have found a champion among us who can win the golden fleece.And Aietes bit his lips for he fancied that they had fled away by night but he could not go back from his promise so he gave them the serpents teeth.Then he called for his chariot and his horses and sent heralds through all the town and all the people went out with him to the dreadful Wargods field.And there Aietes sat upon his throne with his warriors on each hand thousands and tens of thousands clothed from head to foot in steel chainmail. And the people and the women crowded to every window and bank and wall while the Minuai stood together a mere handful in the midst of that great host.And Chalciope was there and Argus trembling and Medeia wrapped closely in her veil but Aietes did not know that she was muttering cunning spells between her lips.Then Jason cried Fulfil your promise and let your fiery bulls come forth.Then Aietes bade open the gates and the magic bulls leapt out. Their brazen hoofs rang upon the ground and their nostrils sent out sheets of flame as they rushed with lowered heads upon Jason but he never flinched a step. The flame of their breath swept round him but it singed not a hair of his head and the bulls stopped short and trembled when Medeia began her spell.Then Jason sprang upon the nearest and seized him by the horn and up and down they wrestled till the bull fell grovelling on his knees for the heart of the brute died within him and his mighty limbs were loosed beneath the steadfast eye of that dark witchmaiden and the magic whisper of her lips.So both the bulls were tamed and yoked and Jason bound them to the plough and goaded them onward with his lance till he had ploughed the sacred field.And all the Minuai shouted but Aietes bit his lips with rage for the half of Jasons work was over and the sun was yet high in heaven.Then he took the serpents teeth and sowed them and waited what would befall. But Medeia looked at him and at his helmet lest he should forget the lesson she had taught.And every furrow heaved and bubbled and out of every clod rose a man. Out of the earth they rose by thousands each clad from head to foot in steel and drew their swords and rushed on Jason where he stood in the midst alone.Then the Minuai grew pale with fear for him but Aietes laughed a bitter laugh. See if I had not warriors enough already round me I could call them out of the bosom of the earth.But Jason snatched off his helmet and hurled it into the thickest of the throng. And blind madness came upon them suspicion hate and fear and one cried to his fellow Thou didst strike me and another Thou art Jason thou shalt die So fury seized those earthborn phantoms and each turned his hand against the rest and they fought and were never weary till they all lay dead upon the ground. Then the magic furrows opened and the kind earth took them home into her breast and the grass grew up all green again above them and Jasons work was done.Then the Minuai rose and shouted till Prometheus heard them from his crag. And Jason criedLead me to the fleece this moment before the sun goes down.But Aietes thoughtHe has conquered the bulls and sown and reaped the deadly crop. Who is this who is proof against all magic He may kill the serpent yet. So he delayed and sat taking counsel with his princes till the sun went down and all was dark. Then he bade a herald cry Every man to his home for tonight. Tomorrow we will meet these heroes and speak about the golden fleece.Then he turned and looked at Medeia This is your doing false witchmaid You have helped these yellowhaired strangers and brought shame upon your father and yourselfMedeia shrank and trembled and her face grew pale with fear and Aietes knew that she was guilty and whispered If they win the fleece you dieBut the Minuai marched toward their ship growling like lions cheated of their prey for they saw that Aietes meant to mock them and to cheat them out of all their toil. And Oileus said Let us go to the grove together and take the fleece by force.And Idas the rash cried Let us draw lots who shall go in first for while the dragon is devouring one the rest can slay him and carry off the fleece in peace. But Jason held them back though he praised them for he hoped for Medeias help.And after awhile Medeia came trembling and wept a long while before she spoke. And at lastMy end is come and I must die for my father has found out that I have helped you. You he would kill if he dared but he will not harm you because you have been his guests. Go then go and remember poor Medeia when you are far away across the sea. But all the heroes criedIf you die we die with you for without you we cannot win the fleece and home we will not go without it but fall here fighting to the last man.You need not die said Jason. Flee home with us across the sea. Show us first how to win the fleece for you can do it. Why else are you the priestess of the grove Show us but how to win the fleece and come with us and you shall be my queen and rule over the rich princes of the Minuai in Iolcos by the sea.And all the heroes pressed round and vowed to her that she should be their queen.Medeia wept and shuddered and hid her face in her hands for her heart yearned after her sisters and her playfellows and the home where she was brought up as a child. But at last she looked up at Jason and spoke between her sobsMust I leave my home and my people to wander with strangers across the sea The lot is cast and I must endure it. I will show you how to win the golden fleece. Bring up your ship to the woodside and moor her there against the bank and let Jason come up at midnight and one brave comrade with him and meet me beneath the wall.Then all the heroes cried togetherI will go and I and I And Idas the rash grew mad with envy for he longed to be foremost in all things. But Medeia calmed them and said Orpheus shall go with Jason and bring his magic harp for I hear of him that he is the king of all minstrels and can charm all things on earth.And Orpheus laughed for joy and clapped his hands because the choice had fallen on him for in those days poets and singers were as bold warriors as the best.So at midnight they went up the bank and found Medeia and beside came Absyrtus her young brother leading a yearling lamb.Then Medeia brought them to a thicket beside the Wargods gate and there she bade Jason dig a ditch and kill the lamb and leave it there and strew on it magic herbs and honey from the honeycomb.Then sprang up through the earth with the red fire flashing before her Brimo the wild witchhuntress while her mad hounds howled around. She had one head like a horses and another like a ravening hounds and another like a hissing snakes and a sword in either hand. And she leapt into the ditch with her hounds and they ate and drank their fill while Jason and Orpheus trembled and Medeia hid her eyes. And at last the witchqueen vanished and fled with her hounds into the woods and the bars of the gates fell down and the brazen doors flew wide and Medeia and the heroes ran forward and hurried through the poison wood among the dark stems of the mighty beeches guided by the gleam of the golden fleece until they saw it hanging on one vast tree in the midst. And Jason would have sprung to seize it but Medeia held him back and pointed shuddering to the treefoot where the mighty serpent lay coiled in and out among the roots with a body like a mountainpine. His coils stretched many a fathom spangled with bronze and gold and half of him they could see but no more for the rest lay in the darkness far beyond.And when he saw them coming he lifted up his head and watched them with his small bright eyes and flashed his forked tongue and roared like the fire among the woodlands till the forest tossed and groaned. For his cries shook the trees from leaf to root and swept over the long reaches of the river and over etess hall and woke the sleepers in the city till mothers clasped their children in their fear.But Medeia called gently to him and he stretched out his long spotted neck and licked her hand and looked up in her face as if to ask for food. Then she made a sign to Orpheus and he began his magic song.And as he sung the forest grew calm again and the leaves on every tree hung still and the serpents head sank down and his brazen coils grew limp and his glittering eyes closed lazily till he breathed as gently as a child while Orpheus called to pleasant Slumber who gives peace to men and beasts and waves.Then Jason leapt forward warily and stept across that mighty snake and tore the fleece from off the treetrunk and the four rushed down the garden to the bank where the Argo lay.There was a silence for a moment while Jason held the golden fleece on high. Then he criedGo now good Argo swift and steady if ever you would see Pelion more.And she went as the heroes drove her grim and silent all with muffled oars till the pinewood bent like willow in their hands and stout Argo groaned beneath their strokes.On and on beneath the dewy darkness they fled swiftly down the swirling stream underneath black walls and temples and the castles of the princes of the East past sluicemouths and fragrant gardens and groves of all strange fruits past marshes where fat kine lay sleeping and long beds of whispering reeds till they heard the merry music of the surge upon the bar as it tumbled in the moonlight all alone.Into the surge they rushed and Argo leapt the breakers like a horse for she knew the time was come to show her mettle and win honour for the heroes and herself.Into the surge they rushed and Argo leapt the breakers like a horse till the heroes stopped all panting each man upon his oar as she slid into the still broad sea.Then Orpheus took his harp and sang a pan till the heroes hearts rose high again and they rowed on stoutly and steadfastly away into the darkness of the West.
There was once a king who had four children three daughters and a son who was the heir to the throne. One day the king said to the prince My son I have decided to marry your three sisters to the first persons who pass our palace at noon. At that time there first passed a swineherd then a huntsman and finally a gravedigger. The king had them all three summoned to his presence and told the swineherd that he wished to give him his oldest daughter for a wife the second to the huntsman and the third to the gravedigger. Those poor creatures thought they were dreaming. But they saw that the king spoke seriously or rather commanded. Then all confused but well pleased they said Let your Majestys will be done. The prince who loved his youngest sister dearly was deeply grieved that she should become a gravediggers wife. He begged the king not to make this match but the king would not listen to him.The prince grieved at his fathers caprice would not be present at his sisters wedding but took a walk in the garden at the foot of the palace. Now while the priest in the marriage hall was blessing the three brides the garden suddenly bloomed with the fairest flowers and there came forth from a white cloud a voice which said Happy he who shall have a kiss from the lips of the fair Fiorita The prince trembled so that he could hardly stand and afterward leaning against an olivetree he began to weep for the sisters he had lost and remained buried in thought many hours. Then he started as if awakening from a dream and said to himself I must flee from my fathers house. I will wander about the world and will not rest until I have a kiss from the lips of the fair Fiorita.He travelled over land and sea over mountains and plains and found no living soul that could give him word of the fair Fiorita. Three years had elapsed when one day leaving a wood and journeying through a beautiful plain he arrived at a palace before which was a fountain and drew near to drink. A child two years old who was playing by the fountain seeing him approach began to cry and call its mother. The mother when she saw the prince ran to meet him embraced him and kissed him crying Welcome welcome my brother The prince at first did not recognize her but looking at her closely in the face he saw that it was his oldest sister and embracing her in turn exclaimed How glad I am to see you my sister and they rejoiced greatly. The sister invited him to enter the palace which was hers and led him to her husband who was much pleased to see him and all three overwhelmed with caresses the child who by calling his mother had been the cause of all that joy.The prince then asked about his other two sisters and his brotherinlaw replied that they were well and lived in a lordly way with their husbands. The prince was surprised and his brotherinlaw added that the fortunes of the three husbands of his sisters had changed since they had been enchanted by a magician. And cannot I see my other two sisters asked the prince. The brotherinlaw replied Direct your journey towards sunrise. After a day you will find your second sister after two days the third. But I must seek the way to the fair Fiorita and I do not know whether it is towards sunrise or sunset. It is precisely towards sunrise and you are doubly fortunate first because you will see your two sisters again secondly because from the last you can receive information about the fair Fiorita. But before departing I wish to give you a remembrance. Take these hogs bristles. The first time you encounter any danger from which you cannot extricate yourself throw them on the ground and I will free you from the danger. The prince took the bristles and after he had thanked his brotherinlaw resumed his journey.The next day he arrived at the palace of his second sister was received there also with great joy and this brotherinlaw too wished to give him a memento before he departed and because he had been a huntsman presented him with a bunch of birds feathers telling him the same thing that the other brotherinlaw had. He thanked him and departed. The third day he came to his youngest sisters who seeing the brother who had always loved her more dearly than his other sisters welcomed him more warmly as did also her husband. The latter gave him a little human bone giving him the same advice as the other brothersinlaw had. His sister then told him that the fair Fiorita lived a days journey from there and that he could learn more about her from an old woman who was indebted to her and to whom she sent him.As soon as the prince arrived at the fair Fioritas country she was the kings daughter he went to the old woman. When she heard that he was the brother of the one who had been so kind to her she received him like a son. Fortunately the old womans house was exactly opposite that side of the kings palace where there was a window to which the fair Fiorita came every day at dawn. Now one morning at that hour she appeared at the window scarcely covered by a white veil. When the prince saw that flower of beauty he was so agitated that he would have fallen had not the old woman supported him. The old woman attempted to dissuade him from the idea of marrying the fair Fiorita saying that the king would give his daughter only to him who should discover a hidden place and that he killed him who could not find it and that already many princes had lost their lives for her. But notwithstanding he answered that he should die if he could not obtain possession of the fair Fiorita. Having learned afterward from the old woman that the king bought for his daughter the rarest musical instruments hear what he devised He went to a cymbalmaker and said I want a cymbal that will play three tunes and each tune to last a day and to be made in such a way that a man can be hidden inside of it and I will pay you a thousand ducats for it. When it is finished I will get in it and you must go and play it in front of the kings palace and if the king wishes to buy it you will sell it to him on condition that you shall take it every three days to fix it. The cymbalmaker consented and did all that the prince commanded him. The king purchased the cymbal with the makers condition had it carried to his daughters bedchamber and said to her See my daughter I do not wish you to lack any diversion even when you are in bed and cannot sleep.Next to the fair Fioritas chamber slept her maids of honor. In the night when all were asleep the prince who was hidden in the cymbal came out and called Fair Fiorita fair Fiorita She awoke in a fright and cried Come my maids of honor I hear some one calling me. The maids of honor came quickly but found no one for the prince hid himself suddenly in the instrument. The same thing happened twice and the maids coming and finding no one the fair Fiorita said Well it must be my fancy. If I call you again do not come I command you. The prince within the cymbal heard this. Scarcely had the maids of honor fallen asleep again when the prince approached the fair ones bed and said Fair Fiorita give me I beg you a kiss from your lips if you do not I shall die. She all trembling called her maids but obeying her command they did not come. Then she said to the prince You are fortunate and have won. Draw near. And she gave him the kiss and on the princes lips there remained a beautiful rose. Take this rose she said and keep it on your heart for it will bring you good luck. The prince placed it on his heart and then told his fair one all his history from the time he had left his fathers palace until he had introduced himself into her chamber by the trick with the cymbal. The fair Fiorita was well pleased and said that she would willingly marry him but to succeed he must perform many difficult tasks which the king would lay upon him. First he must discover the way to a hidingplace where the king had concealed her with a hundred damsels then he must recognize her among the hundred damsels all dressed alike and veiled. But she said you need not trouble yourself about these difficulties for the rose you have taken from my lips and which you will always wear over your heart will draw you like the loadstone first to the hidingplace and afterward to my arms. But the king will set you other tasks and perhaps terrible ones. These you must think of yourself. Let us leave it to God and fortune.The prince went at once to the king and asked for the fair Fioritas hand. The king did not refuse it but made the same conditions that the princess had told him of. He consented and by the help of the rose quickly performed the first tasks. Bravo exclaimed the king when the prince recognized the fair Fiorita among the other damsels but this is not enough. Then he shut him up in a large room all full of fruit and commanded him under pain of death to eat it all up in a day. The prince was in despair but fortunately he remembered the hogs bristles and the advice which his first brotherinlaw had given him. He threw the bristles on the ground and there suddenly came forth a great herd of swine which ate up all the fruit and then disappeared. This task was accomplished. But the king proposed another. He wished the prince to retire with his bride and cause her to fall asleep at the singing of the birds which are the sweetest to hear and the most beautiful to see. The prince remembered the bunch of feathers given him by his brotherinlaw the huntsman and threw them on the ground. Suddenly there appeared the most beautiful birds in the world and sang so sweetly that the king himself fell asleep. But a servant awakened him at once because he had commanded it and he said to the prince and his daughter Now you can enjoy your love at liberty. But tomorrow on arising you must present me with a child two years old who can speak and call you by name. If not you will both be killed. Now let us retire my dear wife said the prince to the fair Fiorita. Between now and tomorrow some saint will aid us. The next morning the prince remembered the bone which his brotherinlaw the gravedigger had given him. He rose and threw it to the ground and lo a beautiful child with a golden apple in his right hand who cried papa and mamma. The king entered the room and the child ran to meet him and wished to put the golden apple on the crown which the king wore. The king then kissed the child blessed the pair and taking the crown from his head put it on his soninlaws saying This is now yours. Then they gave a great feast at the court for the wedding and they invited the princes three sisters with their husbands. And the princes father receiving such good news of the son whom he believed lost hastened to embrace him and gave him his crown too. So the prince and the fair Fiorita became king and queen of two realms and from that time on were always happy.
This is a story from the sanddunes or sandhills of Jutland though it does not begin in Jutland the northern peninsula but far away in the south in Spain. The ocean is the high road between the nationstransport thyself thither in thought to sunny Spain. There it is warm and beautiful there the fiery pomegranate blossoms flourish among the dark laurels from the mountains a cool refreshing wind blows down upon and over the orange gardens over the gorgeous Moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls through the streets go children in procession with candles and with waving flags and over them lofty and clear rises the sky with its gleaming stars. There is a sound of song and of castagnettes and youths and maidens join in the dance under the blooming acacias while the mendicant sits upon the hewn marble stone refreshing himself with the juicy melon and dreamily enjoying life. The whole is like a glorious dream. And there was a newly married couple who completely gave themselves up to its charm moreover they possessed the good things of this life health and cheerfulness of soul riches and honour.We are as happy as it is possible to be exclaimed the young couple from the depths of their hearts They had indeed but one step more to mount in the ladder of happiness in the hope that God would give them a child a son like them in form and in spirit.The happy child would be welcomed with rejoicing would be tended with all care and love and enjoy every advantage that wealth and ease possessed by an influential family could give.And the days went by like a glad festival.Life is a gracious gift of Providence an almost inappreciable gift said the young wife and yet they tell us that fulness of joy is found only in the future life for ever and ever. I cannot compass the thought.And perhaps the thought arises from the arrogance of men said the husband. It seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for ever that we shall be as gods. Were these not the words of the serpent the origin of falsehoodSurely you do not doubt the future life exclaimed the young wife and it seemed as if one of the first shadows flitted over the sunny heaven of her thoughts.Faith promises it and the priests tells us so replied the man but amid all my happiness I feel that it is arrogance to demand a continued happiness another life after this. Has not so much been given us in this state of existence that we ought to be that we must be contented with itYes it has been given to us said the young wife but to how many thousands is not this life one scene of hard trial How many have been thrown into this world as if only to suffer poverty and shame and sickness and misfortune If there were no life after this everything on earth would be too unequally distributed and the Almighty would not be justice itself.Yonder beggar replied the man has his joys which seem to him great and which rejoice him as much as the king is rejoiced in the splendour of his palace. And then do you not think that the beast of burden which suffers blows and hunger and works itself to death suffers from its heavy fate The dumb beast might likewise demand a future life and declare the decree unjust that does not admit it into a higher place of creation.He has said In my Fathers house are many mansions replied the young wife heaven is immeasurable as the love of our Maker is immeasurable. Even the dumb beast is His creature and I firmly believe that no life will be lost but that each will receive that amount of happiness which he can enjoy and which is sufficient for him.This world is sufficient for me said the man and he threw his arms round his beautiful amiable wife and then smoked his cigarette on the open balcony where the cool air was filled with the fragrance of oranges and pinks. The sound of music and the clatter of castagnettes came up from the road the stars gleamed above and two eyes full of affection the eyes of his wife looked on him with the undying glance of love.Such a moment he said makes it worth while to be born to fall and to disappear and he smiled. The young wife raised her hand in mild reproach and the shadow passed away from her world and they were happyquite happy.Everything seemed to work together for them. They advanced in honour in prosperity and in joy. There was a change indeed but only a change of place not in enjoyment of life and of happiness. The young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the court of Russia. This was an honourable office and his birth and his acquirements gave him a title to be thus honoured. He possessed a great fortune and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own for she was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant. One of this merchants largest and finest ships was to be dispatched during that year to Stockholm and it was arranged that the dear young people the daughter and the soninlaw should travel in it to St. Petersburg. And all the arrangements on board were princelyrich carpets for the feet and silk and luxury on all sides.In an old heroic song The Kings Son of England it says Moreover he sailed in a gallant ship and the anchor was gilded with ruddy gold and each rope was woven through with silk And this ship involuntarily rose in the mind of him who saw the vessel from Spain for here was the same pomp and the same parting thought naturally arosethe thoughtGod grant that we all in joyOnce more may meet again.And the wind blew fairly seaward from the Spanish shore and the parting was to be but a brief one for in a few weeks the voyagers would reach their destination but when they came out upon the high seas the wind sank the sea became calm and shining the stars of heaven gleamed brightly and they were festive evenings that were spent in the sumptuous cabin.At length the voyagers began to wish for wind for a favouring breeze but the breeze would not blow or if it did arise it was contrary. Thus weeks passed away two full months and then at last the fair wind blewit blew from the southwest. The ship sailed on the high seas between Scotland and Jutland and the wind increased just as in the old song of The Kings Son of England.And it blew a storm and the rain came downAnd they found not land nor shelterAnd forth they threw their anchor of goldAs the wind blew westward toward Denmark.This all happened a long long while ago. King Christian VII. then sat on the Danish throne and he was still a young man. Much has happened since that time much has changed or has been changed. Sea and moorland have been converted into green meadows heath has become arable land and in the shelter of the West Jute huts grow apple trees and rose bushes though they certainly require to be sought for as they bend beneath the sharp west wind. In Western Jutland one may go back in thought to the old times farther back than the days when Christian VII. bore rule. As it did then in Jutland the brown heath now also extends for miles with its Huns Graves its arial spectacles and its crossing sandy uneven roads westward where large rivulets run into the bays extend marshes and meadow land girdled with lofty sandhills which like a row of Alps raise their peaked summits towards the sea only broken by the high clayey ridges from which the waves year by year bite out huge mouthfuls so that the impending shores fall down as if by the shock of an earthquake. Thus it is there today and thus it was many many years ago when the happy pair were sailing in the gorgeous ship.It was in the last days of September a Sunday and sunny weather the chiming of the church bells in the bay of Nissum was wafted along like a chain of sounds. The churches there are erected almost entirely of hewn boulder stones each like a piece of rock the North Sea might foam over them and they would not be overthrown. Most of them are without steeples and the bells are hung between two beams in the open air. The service was over and the congregation thronged out into the churchyard where then as now not a tree nor a bush was to be seen not a single flower had been planted there nor had a wreath been laid upon the graves. Rough mounds show where the dead had been buried and rank grass tossed by the wind grows thickly over the whole churchyard. Here and there a grave had a monument to show in the shape of a halfdecayed block of wood rudely shaped into the form of a coffin the said block having been brought from the forest of West Jutland but the forest of West Jutland is the wild sea itself where the inhabitants find the hewn beams and planks and fragments which the breakers cast ashore. The wind and the sea fog soon destroy the wood. One of these blocks had been placed by loving hands on a childs grave and one of the women who had come out of the church stepped towards it. She stood still in front of it and let her glance rest on the discoloured memorial. A few moments afterwards her husband stepped up to her. Neither of them spoke a word but he took her hand and they wandered across the brown heath over moor and meadow towards the sandhills for a long time they thus walked silently side by side.That was a good sermon today the man said at length. If we had not God to look to we should have nothingYes observed the woman He sends joy and sorrow and He has a right to send them. Tomorrow our little boy would have been five years old if we had been allowed to keep him.You will gain nothing by fretting wife said the man. The boy is well provided for. He is there whither we pray to go.And they said nothing more but went forward to their house among the sandhills. Suddenly in front of one of the houses where the sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining roots there arose what appeared to be a column of smoke rising into the air. A gust of wind swept in among the hills whirling the particles of sand high in the air. Another and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped and beat violently against the wall of the hut and then all was still again and the sun shone down hotly.Man and wife stepped into the house. They had soon taken off their Sunday clothes and emerging again they hurried away over the dunes which stood there like huge waves of sand suddenly arrested in their course while the sandweeds and the dunegrass with its bluish stalks spread a changing colour over them. A few neighbours came up and helped one another to draw the boats higher up on the sand. The wind now blew more sharply than before it was cutting and cold and when they went back over the sandhills sand and little pointed stones blew into their faces. The waves reared themselves up with their white crowns of foam and the wind cut off their crests flinging the foam far around.The evening came on. In the air was a swelling roar moaning and complaining like a troop of despairing spirits that sounded above the hoarse rolling of the sea for the fishers little hut was on the very margin. The sand rattled against the window panes and every now and then came a violent gust of wind that shook the house to its foundations. It was dark but towards midnight the moon would rise.The air became clearer but the storm swept in all its gigantic force over the perturbed sea. The fisher people had long gone to bed but in such weather there was no chance of closing an eye. Presently there was a knocking at the window and the door was opened and a voice saidTheres a great ship fast stranded on the outermost reef.In a moment the fish people had sprung from their couch and hastily arrayed themselves.The moon had risen it was light enough to make the surrounding objects visible to those who could open their eyes for the blinding clouds of sand. The violence of the wind was terrible and only by creeping forward between the gusts was it possible to pass among the sandhills and now the salt spray flew up from the sea like down while the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards the beach. It required a practised eye to descry the vessel out in the offing. The vessel was a noble brig. The billows now lifted it over the reef three or four cables lengths out of the usual channel. It drove towards the land struck against the second reef and remained fixed.To render assistance was impossible the sea rolled fairly in upon the vessel making a clean breach over her. Those on shore fancied they heard the cries of help from on board and could plainly descry the busy useless efforts made by the stranded crew. Now a wave came rolling onward falling like a rock upon the bowsprit and tearing it from the brig. The stern was lifted high above the flood. Two people were seen to embrace and plunge together into the sea in a moment more and one of the largest waves that rolled towards the sandhills threw a body upon the shore. It was a woman and appeared quite dead said the sailors but some women thought they discerned signs of life in her and the stranger was carried across the sandhills into the fishermans hut. How beautiful and fair she was certainly she must be a great lady.They laid her upon the humble bed that boasted not a yard of linen but there was a woollen coverlet and that would keep the occupant warm.Life returned to her but she was delirious and knew nothing of what had happened or where she was and it was better so for everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea. It was with her ship as with the vessel in the song of The Kings Son of England.Alas it was a grief to seeHow the gallant ship sank speedily.Portions of wreck and fragments of wood drifted ashore and they were all that remained of what had been the ship. The wind still drove howling over the coast. For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest but she awoke in pain and cries of anguish and fear came from her lips. She opened her wonderfully beautiful eyes and spoke a few words but none understood her.And behold as a reward for the pain and sorrow she had undergone she held in her arms a newborn child the child that was to have rested upon a gorgeous couch surrounded by silken curtains in the sumptuous home. It was to have been welcomed with joy to a life rich in all the goods of the earth and now Providence had caused it to be born in this humble retreat and not even a kiss did it receive from its mother.The fishers wife laid the child upon the mothers bosom and it rested on a heart that beat no more for she was dead. The child who was to be nursed by wealth and fortune was cast into the world washed by the sea among the sandhills to partake the fate and heavy days of the poor. And here again comes into our mind the old song of the English kings son in which mention is made of the customs prevalent at that time when knights and squires plundered those who had been saved from shipwreck.The ship had been stranded some distance south of Nissum Bay. The hard inhuman days in which as we have stated the inhabitants of the Jutland shores did evil to the shipwrecked were long past. Affection and sympathy and selfsacrifice for the unfortunate were to be found as they are to be found in our own time in many a brilliant example. The dying mother and the unfortunate child would have found succour and help wherever the wind blew them but nowhere could they have found more earnest care than in the hut of the poor fisherwife who had stood but yesterday with a heavy heart beside the grave which covered her child which would have been five years old that day if God had spared it to her.No one knew who the dead stranger was or could even form a conjecture. The pieces of wreck said nothing on the subject.Into the rich house in Spain no tidings penetrated of the fate of the daughter and the soninlaw. They had not arrived at their destined post and violent storms had raged during the past weeks. At last the verdict was given Foundered at seaall lost.But in the sandhills near Hunsby in the fishermans hut lived a little scion of the rich Spanish family.Where Heaven sends food for two a third can manage to make a meal and in the depths of the sea is many a dish of fish for the hungry.And they called the boy Jrgen.It must certainly be a Jewish child the people said it looks so swarthy.It might be an Italian or a Spaniard observed the clergyman.But to the fisherwoman these three nations seemed all the same and she consoled herself with the idea that the child was baptized as a Christian.The boy throve. The noble blood in his veins was warm and he became strong on his homely fare. He grew apace in the humble house and the Danish dialect spoken by the West Jutes became his language. The pomegranate seed from Spanish soil became a hardy plant on the coast of West Jutland. Such may be a mans fate To this home he clung with the roots of his whole being. He was to have experience of cold and hunger and the misfortunes and hardships that surrounded the humble but he tasted also of the poor mans joys.Childhood has sunny heights for all whose memory gleams through the whole after life. The boy had many opportunities for pleasure and play. The whole coast for miles and miles was full of playthings for it was a mosaic of pebbles red as coral yellow as amber and others again white and rounded like birds eggs and all smoothed and prepared by the sea. Even the bleached fish skeletons the water plants dried by the wind seaweed white gleaming and long linenlike bands waving among the stones all these seemed made to give pleasure and amusement to the eye and the thoughts and the boy had an intelligent mindmany and great faculties lay dormant in him. How readily he retained in his mind the stories and songs he heard and how neathanded he was With stones and mussel shells he put together pictures and ships with which one could decorate the room and he could cut out his thoughts wonderfully on a stick his fostermother said though the boy was still so young and little His voice sounded sweetly every melody flowed at once from his lips. Many chords were attained in his heart which might have sounded out into the world if he had been placed elsewhere than in the fishermans hut by the North Sea.One day another ship was stranded there. Among other things a chest of rare flower bulbs floated ashore. Some were put into the cooking pots for they were thought to be eatable and others lay and shrivelled in the sand but they did not accomplish their purpose or unfold the richness of colour whose germ was within them. Would it be better with Jrgen The flower bulbs had soon played their part but he had still years of apprenticeship before him.Neither he nor his friends remarked in what a solitary and uniform way one day succeeded another for there was plenty to do and to see. The sea itself was a great lesson book unfolding a new leaf every day such as calm and storm breakers and waifs. The visits to the church were festal visits. But among the festal visits in the fishermans house one was particularly distinguished. It was repeated twice in the year and was in fact the visit of the brother of Jrgens fostermother the eel breeder from Zjaltring upon the neighbourhood of the Bow Hill. He used to come in a cart painted red and filled with eels. The cart was covered and locked like a box and painted all over with blue and white tulips. It was drawn by two dun oxen and Jrgen was allowed to guide them.The eel breeder was a witty fellow a merry guest and brought a measure of brandy with him. Every one received a small glassful or a cupful when there was a scarcity of glasses even Jrgen had as much as a large thimbleful that he might digest the fat eel the eel breeder said who always told the same story over again and when his hearers laughed he immediately told it over again to the same audience. As during his childhood and even later Jrgen used many expressions from this story of the eel breeders and made use of it in various ways it is as well that we should listen to it too. Here it isThe eels went into the bay and the mothereel said to her daughters who begged leave to go a little way up the bay Dont go too far the ugly eel spearer might come and snap you all up. But they went too far and of eight daughters only three came back to the eelmother and these wept and said We only went a little way before the door and the ugly eel spearer came directly and stabbed five of our party to death. Theyll come again said the mothereel. Oh no exclaimed the daughters for he skinned them and cut them in two and fried them. Oh theyll come again the mothereel persisted. No replied the daughters for he ate them up. Theyll come again repeated the mothereel. But he drank brandy after them continued the daughters. Ah then theyll never come back said the mother and she burst out crying Its the brandy that buries the eels.And therefore said the eel breeder in conclusion it is always right to take brandy after eating eels.the eel breeders visit.And this story was the tinsel thread the most humorous recollection of Jrgens life. He likewise wanted to go a little way outside the door and up the baythat is to say out into the world in a ship and his mother said like the eel breeder There are so many bad peopleeel spearers But he wished to go a little way past the sandhills a little way into the dunes and he succeeded in doing so. Four merry days the happiest of his childhood unrolled themselves and the whole beauty and splendour of Jutland all the joy and sunshine of his home was concentrated in these. He was to go to a festivalthough it was certainly a burial feast.A wealthy relative of the fishermans family had died. The farm lay deep in the country eastward and a point towards the north as the saying is. Jrgens fosterparents were to go and he was to accompany them from the dunes across heath and moor. They came to the green meadows where the river Skjrn rolls its course the river of many eels where mothereels dwell with their daughters who are caught and eaten up by wicked people. But men were said sometimes to have acted no better towards their own fellow men for had not the knight Sir Bugge been murdered by wicked people and though he was well spoken of had he not wanted to kill the architect as the legend tells us who had built for him the castle with the thick walls and tower where Jrgen and his parents now stood and where the river falls into the bay The wall on the ramparts still remained and red crumbling fragments lay strewn around. Here it was that Sir Bugge after the architect had left him said to one of his men Go thou after him and say Master the tower shakes. If he turns round you are to kill him and take from him the money I paid him but if he does not turn round let him depart in peace. The man obeyed and the architect never turned round but called back The tower does not shake in the least but one day there will come a man from the west in a blue cloak who will cause it to shake And indeed so it chanced a hundred years later for the North Sea broke in and the tower was cast down but the man who then possessed the castle Prebjrn Gyldenstjerne built a new castle higher up at the end of the meadow and that stands to this day and is called Nrre Vosborg.Past this castle went Jrgen and his fosterparents. They had told him its story during the long winter evenings and now he saw the lordly castle with its double moat and trees and bushes the wall covered with ferns rose within the moat but most beautiful of all were the lofty lime trees which grew up to the highest windows and filled the air with sweet fragrance. In a corner of the garden towards the northwest stood a great bush full of blossom like winter snow amid the summers green it was a juniper bush the first that Jrgen had seen thus in bloom. He never forgot it nor the lime tree the childs soul treasured up these remembrances of beauty and fragrance to gladden the old man.From Nrre Vosborg where the juniper blossomed the way went more easily for they encountered other guests who were also bound for the burial and were riding in waggons. Our travellers had to sit all together on a little box at the back of the waggon but even this was preferable to walking they thought. So they pursued their journey in the waggon across the rugged heath. The oxen which drew the vehicle slipped every now and then where a patch of fresh grass appeared amid the heather. The sun shone warm and it was wonderful to behold how in the far distance something like smoke seemed to be rising and yet this smoke was clearer than the mist it was transparent and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afar over the heath.That is Lokeman driving his sheep said some one and this was enough to excite the fancy of Jrgen. It seemed to him as if they were now going to enter fairyland though everything was still real.How quiet it was Far and wide the heath extended around them like a beautiful carpet. The heather bloomed the juniper bushes and the fresh oak saplings stood up like nosegays from the earth. An inviting place for a frolic if it were not for the number of poisonous adders of which the travellers spoke as they did also of the wolves which formerly infested the place from which circumstance the region was still called the Wolfsborg region. The old man who guided the oxen related how in the lifetime of his father the horses had to sustain many a hard fight with the wild beasts that were now extinct and how he himself when he went out one morning to bring in the horses had found one of them standing with its forefeet on a wolf it had killed after the savage beast had torn and lacerated the legs of the brave horse.The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too quickly accomplished. They stopped before the house of mourning where they found plenty of guests within and without. Waggon after waggon stood ranged in a row and horses and oxen went out to crop the scanty pasture. Great sandhills like those at home in the North Sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide. How had they come here miles into the interior of the land and as large and high as those on the coast The wind had lifted and carried them hither and to them also a history was attached.Psalms were sung and a few of the old people shed tears beyond this the guests were cheerful enough as it appeared to Jrgen and there was plenty to eat and drink. Eels there were of the fattest upon which brandy should be poured to bury them as the eel breeder said and certainly his maxim was here carried out.Jrgen went to and fro in the house. On the third day he felt quite at home like as in the fishermans hut on the sandhills where he had passed his early days. Here on the heath there was certainly an unheardof wealth for the flowers and blackberries and bilberries were to be found in plenty so large and sweet that when they were crushed beneath the tread of the passers by the heath was coloured with their red juice.Here was a Huns Grave and yonder another. Columns of smoke rose into the still air it was a heathfire he was told that shone so splendidly in the dark evening.Now came the fourth day and the funeral festivities were to conclude and they were to go back from the landdunes to the sanddunes.Ours are the best said the old fisherman Jrgens fosterfather these have no strength.And they spoke of the way in which the sanddunes had come into the country and it seemed all very intelligible. This was the explanation they gaveA corpse had been found on the coast and the peasants had buried it in the churchyard and from that time the sand began to fly and the sea broke in violently. A wise man in the parish advised them to open the grave and to look if the buried man was not lying sucking his thumb for if so he was a man of the sea and the sea would not rest until it had got him back. So the grave was opened and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth. So they laid him upon a cart and harnessed two oxen before it and as if stung by an adder the oxen ran away with the man of the sea over heath and moorland to the ocean and then the sand ceased flying inland but the hills that had been heaped up still remained there. All this Jrgen heard and treasured in his memory from the happiest days of his childhood the days of the burial feast. How glorious it was to get out into strange regions and to see strange people And he was to go farther still. He was not yet fourteen years old when he went out in a ship to see what the world could show him bad weather heavy seas malice and hard menthese were his experiences for he became a ship boy. There were cold nights and bad living and blows to be endured then he felt as if his noble Spanish blood boiled within him and bitter wicked words seethed up to his lips but it was better to gulp them down though he felt as the eel must feel when it is flayed and cut up and put into the fryingpan.I shall come again said a voice within him. He saw the Spanish coast the native land of his parents. He even saw the town where they had lived in happiness and prosperity but he knew nothing of his home or race and his race knew just as little about him.The poor ship boy was not allowed to land but on the last day of their stay he managed to get ashore. There were several purchases to be made and he was to carry them on board.There stood Jrgen in his shabby clothes which looked as if they had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney for the first time he the inhabitant of the dunes saw a great city. How lofty the houses seemed and how full of people were the streets some pushing this way some thata perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants monks and soldiersa calling and shouting and jingling of bellharnessed asses and mules and the church bells chiming between song and sound hammering and knocking all going on at once. Every handicraft had its home in the basements of the houses or in the lanes and the sun shone so hotly and the air was so close that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles cockchafers bees and flies all humming and murmuring together. Jrgen hardly knew where he was or which way he went. Then he saw just in front of him the mighty portal of the cathedral the lights were gleaming in the dark aisles and a fragrance of incense was wafted towards him. Even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the temple. The sailor with whom Jrgen went took his way through the church and Jrgen stood in the sanctuary. Coloured pictures gleamed from their golden ground. On the altar stood the figure of the Virgin with the child Jesus surrounded by lights and flowers priests in festive garb were chanting and choir boys beautifully attired swung the silver censer. What splendour what magnificence did he see here It streamed through his soul and overpowered him the church and the faith of his parents surrounded him and touched a chord in his soul so that the tears overflowed his eyes.From the church they went to the marketplace. Here a quantity of provisions were given him to carry. The way to the harbour was long and tired and overpowered by various emotions he rested for a few moments before a splendid house with marble pillars statues and broad staircases. Here he rested his burden against the wall. Then a liveried porter came out lifted up a silverheaded cane and drove him awayhim the grandson of the house. But no one there knew that and he just as little as any one. And afterwards he went on board again and there were hard words and cuffs little sleep and much work such were his experiences. They say that it is well to suffer in youth if age brings something to make up for it.His time of servitude on shipboard had expired and the vessel lay once more at Ringkjbing in Jutland he came ashore and went home to the sanddunes by Hunsby but his fostermother had died while he was away on his voyage.A hard winter followed that summer. Snowstorms swept over land and sea and there was a difficulty in getting about. How variously things were distributed in the world here biting cold and snowstorms while in the Spanish land there was burning sunshine and oppressive heat. And yet when here at home there came a clear frosty day and Jrgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea towards the land and across to Vosborg it appeared to him that people could breathe most freely here and here too was a splendid summer In imagination he saw the heath bloom and grow purple with rich juicy berries and saw the elder trees and the lime trees at Vosborg in blossom. He determined to go there once more.Spring came on and the fishery began. Jrgen was an active assistant in this he had grown in the last year and was quick at work. He was full of life he understood how to swim to tread water to turn over and tumble in the flood. They often warned him to beware of the troops of dogfish which could seize the best swimmer and draw him down and devour him but such was not Jrgens fate.At the neighbours on the dune was a boy named Martin with whom Jrgen was very friendly and the two took service in the same ship to Norway and also went together to Holland and they had never had any quarrel but a quarrel can easily come for when a person is hot by nature he often uses strong gestures and that is what Jrgen did one day on board when they had a quarrel about nothing at all. They were sitting behind the cabin door eating out of a delf plate which they had placed between them. Jrgen held his pocketknife in his hand and lifted it against Martin and at the same time became ashy pale in the face and his eyes had an ugly look. Martin only saidAh ha you re one of that sort who are fond of using the knifeHardly were the words spoken when Jrgens hand sank down. He answered not a syllable but went on eating and afterwards walked away to his work. When they were resting again he stepped up to Martin and saidYou may hit me in the face I have deserved it. But I feel as if I had a pot in me that boiled over.There let the thing rest replied Martin and after that they were almost doubly as good friends as before and when afterwards they got back to the dunes and began telling their adventures this was told among the rest and Martin said that Jrgen was certainly passionate but a good fellow for all that.They were both young and strong wellgrown and stalwart but Jrgen was the cleverer of the two.In Norway the peasants go into the mountains and lead out the cattle there to pasture. On the west coast of Jutland huts have been erected among the sandhills they are built of pieces of wreck and roofed with turf and heather. There are sleepingplaces around the walls and here the fisher people live and sleep during the early spring. Every fisherman has his female helper his manager as she is called whose business consists in baiting the hooks preparing the warm beer for the fishermen when they come ashore and getting their dinners cooked when they come back into the hut tired and hungry. Moreover the managers bring up the fish from the boat cut them open prepare them and have generally a great deal to do.Jrgen his father and several other fishermen and their managers inhabited the same hut Martin lived in the next one.One of the girls Else by name had known Jrgen from childhood they were glad to see each other and in many things were of the same mind but in outward appearance they were entirely opposite for he was brown whereas she was pale and had flaxen hair and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine.One day as they were walking together and Jrgen held her hand in his very firmly and warmly she said to himJrgen I have something weighing upon my heart Let me be your manager for you are like a brother to me whereas Martin who has engaged mehe and I are loversbut you need not tell that to the rest.And it seemed to Jrgen as if the loose sand were giving way under his feet. He spoke not a word but only nodded his head which signified yes. More was not required but suddenly he felt in his heart that he detested Martin and the longer he considered of thisfor he had never thought of Else in this way beforethe more did it become clear to him that Martin had stolen from him the only being he loved and now it was all at once plain to him that Else was the being in question.When the sea is somewhat disturbed and the fishermen come home in their great boat it is a sight to behold how they cross the reefs. One of the men stands upright in the bow of the boat and the others watch him sitting with the oars in their hands. Outside the reef they appear to be rowing not towards the land but backing out to sea till the man standing in the boat gives them the sign that the great wave is coming which is to float them across the reef and accordingly the boat is liftedlifted high in the air so that its keel is seen from the shore and in the next minute the whole boat is hidden from the eye neither mast nor keel nor people can be seen as though the sea had devoured them but in a few moments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves and the oars move as if the creature had legs. The second and the third reef are passed in the same manner and now the fishermen jump into the water every wave helps them and pushes the boat well forward till at length they have drawn it beyond the range of the breakers.A wrong order given in front of the reefthe slightest hesitationand the boat must founder.Then it would be all over with me and Martin too This thought struck Jrgen while they were out at sea where his fosterfather had been taken alarmingly ill. The fever had seized him. They were only a few oars strokes from the reef and Jrgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the bow.Fatherlet me come he said and his eye glanced towards Martin and across the waves but while every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as the great wave came towering towards them he beheld the pale face of his father and dare not obey the evil impulse that had seized him. The boat came safely across the reef to land but the evil thought remained in his blood and roused up every little fibre of bitterness which had remained in his memory since he and Martin had been comrades. But he could not weave the fibres together nor did he endeavour to do so. He felt that Martin had despoiled him and this was enough to make him detest his former friend. Several of the fishermen noticed this but not Martin who continued obliging and talkativethe latter a little too much.Jrgens adopted father had to keep his bed which became his deathbed for in the next week he died and now Jrgen was installed as heir in the little house behind the sandhills. It was but a little house certainly but still it was something and Martin had nothing of the kind.You will not take sea service again Jrgen observed one of the old fishermen. You will always stay with us now.But this was not Jrgens intention for he was just thinking of looking about him a little in the world. The eel breeder of Zjaltring had an uncle in AltSkage who was a fisherman but at the same time a prosperous merchant who had ships upon the sea he was said to be a good old man and it would not be amiss to enter his service. AltSkage lies in the extreme north of Jutland as far removed from the Hunsby dunes as one can travel in that country and this is just what pleased Jrgen for he did not want to remain till the wedding of Martin and Else which was to be celebrated in a few weeks.else affirms her preference for martin.The old fisherman asserted that it was foolish now to quit the neighbourhood for that Jrgen had a home and Else would probably be inclined to take him rather than Martin.Jrgen answered so much at random that it was not easy to understand what he meant but the old man brought Else to him and she said You have a home now that ought to be well considered.And Jrgen thought of many things.The sea has heavy waves but there are heavier waves in the human heart. Many thoughts strong and weak thronged through Jrgens brain and he said to ElseIf Martin had a house like mine whom would you rather haveBut Martin has no house and cannot get one.But let us suppose he had one.Why then I would certainly take Martin for thats what my heart tells me but one cant live upon that.And Jrgen thought of these things all night through. Something was working within him he could not understand what it was but he had a thought that was stronger than his love for Else and so he went to Martin and what he said and did there was well considered. He let the house to Martin on the most liberal terms saying that he wished to go to sea again because it pleased him to do so. And Else kissed him on the mouth when she heard that for she loved Martin best.In the early morning Jrgen purposed to start. On the evening before his departure when it was already growing late he felt a wish to visit Martin once more he started and among the dunes the old fisher met him who was angry at his going. The old man made jokes about Martin and declared there must be some magic about that fellow of whom all the girls were so fond. Jrgen paid no heed to this speech but said farewell to the old man and went on towards the house where Martin dwelt. He heard loud talking within. Martin was not alone and this made Jrgen waver in his determination for he did not wish to encounter Else and on second consideration he thought it better not to hear Martin thank him again and therefore turned back.On the following morning before break of day he fastened his knapsack took his wooden provision box in his hand and went away among the sandhills towards the coast path. The way was easier to traverse than the heavy sand road and moreover shorter for he intended to go in the first instance to Zjaltring by Bowberg where the eel breeder lived to whom he had promised a visit.The sea lay pure and blue before him and mussel shells and sea pebbles the playthings of his youth crunched under his feet. While he was thus marching on his nose suddenly began to bleed it was a trifling incident but little things can have great significances. A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves. He wiped them off and stopped the bleeding and it seemed to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain. In the sand the seaeringa was blooming here and there. He broke off a stalk and stuck it in his hat he determined to be merry and of good cheer for he was going into the wide worlda little way outside the door in front of the hay as the young eels had said. Beware of bad people who will catch you and flay you cut you in two and put you in the fryingpan he repeated in his mind and smiled for he thought he should find his way through the worldgood courage is a strong weaponThe sun already stood high when he approached the narrow entrance to Nissum Bay. He looked back and saw a couple of horsemen gallopping a long distance behind him and they were accompanied by other people. But this concerned him nothing.The ferry was on the opposite side of the bay. Jrgen called to the ferryman and when the latter came over with the boat Jrgen stepped in but before they had gone halfway across the men whom he had seen riding so hastily behind him hailed the ferryman and summoned him to return in the name of the law. Jrgen did not understand the reason of this but he thought it would be best to turn back and therefore himself took an oar and returned. The moment the boat touched the shore the men sprang on board and before he was aware they had bound his hands with a rope.Thy wicked deed will cost thee thy life they said. It is well that we caught thee.He was accused of nothing less than murder. Martin had been found dead with a knife thrust through his neck. One of the fishermen had late on the previous evening met Jrgen going towards Martins house and this was not the first time Jrgen had raised his knife against Martinso they knew that he was the murderer. The town in which the prison was built was a long way off and the wind was contrary for going there but not half an hour would be required to get across the bay and a quarter of an hour would bring them from thence to Nrre Vosborg a great castle with walls and ditches. One of Jrgens captors was a fisherman a brother of the keeper of the castle and he declared it might be managed that Jrgen should for the present be put into the dungeon at Vosborg where Long Martha the gipsy had been shut up till her execution.No attention was paid to the defence made by Jrgen the few drops of blood upon his shirtsleeve bore heavy witness against him. But Jrgen was conscious of innocence and as there was no chance of immediately righting himself he submitted to his fate.The party landed just at the spot where Sir Bugges castle had stood and where Jrgen had walked with his fosterparents after the burial feast during the four happiest days of his childhood. He was led by the old path over the meadow to Vosborg and again the elder blossomed and the lofty lindens smelt sweet and it seemed but yesterday that he had left the spot.In the two wings of the castle a staircase leads down to a spot below the entrance and from thence there is access to a low vaulted cellar. Here Long Martha had been imprisoned and hence she had been led away to the scaffold. She had eaten the hearts of five children and had been under the delusion that if she could obtain two more she would be able to fly and to make herself invisible. In the midst of the cellar roof was a little narrow airhole but no window. The blooming lindens could not waft a breath of comforting fragrance into that abode where all was dark and mouldy. Only a rough bench stood in the prison but a good conscience is a soft pillow and consequently Jrgen could sleep well.The thick oaken door was locked and secured on the outside by an iron bar but the goblin of superstition can creep through a keyhole into the barons castle just as into the fishermans hut and wherefore should he not creep in here where Jrgen sat thinking of Long Martha and her evil deeds Her last thought on the night before her execution had filled this space and all the magic came into Jrgens mind which tradition asserted to have been practised there in the old times when Sir Schwanwedel dwelt there. All this passed through Jrgens mind and made him shudder but a sunbeama refreshing thought from withoutpenetrated his heart even here it was the remembrance of the blooming elder and the fragrant lime trees.He was not left there long. They carried him off to the town of Ringkjbing where his imprisonment was just as hard.Those times were not like ours. Hard measure was dealt out to the common people and it was just after the days when farms were converted into knights estates on which occasions coachmen and servants were often made magistrates and had it in their power to sentence a poor man for a small offence to lose his property and to corporal punishment. Judges of this kind were still to be found and in Jutland far from the capital and from the enlightened wellmeaning head of the government the law was still sometimes very loosely administered and the smallest grievance that Jrgen had to expect was that his case would be protracted.Cold and cheerless was his abodeand when would this state of things end He had innocently sunk into misfortune and sorrowthat was his fate. He had leisure now to ponder on the difference of fortune on earth and to wonder why this fate had been allotted to him and he felt sure that the question would be answered in the next lifetheexistence that awaits us when this is over. This faith had grown strong in him in the poor fishermans hut that which had never shone into his fathers mind in all the richness and sunshine of Spain was vouchsafed as a light of comfort in his poverty and distressa sign of mercy from God that never deceives.The spring storms began to blow. The rolling and moaning of the North Sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was lulled for then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over a hard road with a mine beneath. Jrgen in his prison heard these sounds and it was a relief to him. No melody could have appealed so directly to his heart as did these sounds of the seathe rolling sea the boundless sea on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind carrying his own house with him wherever he is driven just as the snail carries its home even into a strange land.How he listened to the deep moaning and how the thought arose in himFree free How happy to be free even without shoes and in ragged clothes Sometimes when such thoughts crossed his mind the fiery nature rose within him and he beat the wall with his clenched fists.Weeks months a whole year had gone by when a vagabondNiels the thief called also the horse couperwas arrested and now the better times came and it was seen what wrong Jrgen had endured.In the neighbourhood of Ringkjbing at a beerhouse Niels the thief had met Martin on the afternoon before Jrgens departure from home and before the murder. A few glasses were drunknot enough to cloud any ones brain but yet enough to loosen Martins tongue and he began to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended to marry and when Niels asked where he intended to get the money Martin shook his pocket proudly and saidThe money is there where it ought to be.This boast cost him his life for when he went home Niels went after him and thrust a knife through his throat to rob the murdered man of the expected gold which did not exist.This was circumstantially explained but for us it is enough to know that Jrgen was set at liberty. But what amends did he get for having been imprisoned a whole year and shut out from all communion with men They told him he was fortunate in being proved innocent and that he might go. The burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses and many citizens offered him provisions and beerthere were still good men not all grind and flay. But the best of all was that the merchant Brnne of Skjagen the same into whose service Jrgen intended to go a year since was just at that time on business in the town of Ringkjbing. Brnne heard the whole story and the man had a good heart and understood what Jrgen must have felt and suffered. He therefore made up his mind to make it up to the poor lad and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world.So Jrgen went forth from the prison as if to Paradise to find freedom affection and trust. He was to travel this road now for no goblet of life is all bitterness no good man would pour out such measure to his fellow man and how should He do it who is love itselfLet all that be buried and forgotten said Brnne the merchant. Let us draw a thick line through last year and we will even burn the calendar. And in two days well start for dear friendly peaceful Skjagen. They call Skjagen an outoftheway corner but its a good warm chimneycorner and its windows open towards every part of the world.That was a journeyit was like taking fresh breathout of the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine The heath stood blooming in its greatest pride and the herdboy sat on the Huns Grave and blew his pipe which he had carved for himself out of the sheeps bone. Fata Morgana the beautiful arial phenomenon of the desert showed itself with hanging gardens and swaying forests and the wonderful cloud phenomenon called here the Lokeman driving his flock was seen likewise.Up through the land of the Wendels up towards Skjagen they went from whence the men with the long beards the Longobardi or Lombards had emigrated in the days when in the reign of King Snio all the children and the old people were to have been killed till the noble Dame Gambaruk proposed that the young people had better emigrate. All this was known to Jrgenthus much knowledge he had and even if he did not know the land of the Lombards beyond the high Alps he had an idea how it must be there for in his boyhood he had been in the south in Spain. He thought of the southern fruits piled up there of the red pomegranate blossoms of the humming murmuring and toiling in the great beehive of a city he had seen but after all home is best and Jrgens home was Denmark.jrgens better fortune.At length they reached Wendelskajn as Skjagen is called in the old Norwegian and Icelandic writings. Then already Old Skjagen with the western and eastern town extended for miles with sandhills and arable land as far as the lighthouse near the Skjagenzweig. Then as now the houses were strewn among the windraised sandhillsa desert where the wind sports with the sand and where the voices of the seamen and the wild swans strike harshly on the ear. In the southwest a mile from the sea lies Old Skjagen and here dwelt merchant Brnne and here Jrgen was henceforth to dwell. The great house was painted with tar the smaller buildings had each an overturned boat for a roof the pigsty had been put together of pieces of wreck. There was no fence here for indeed there was nothing to fence in butlong rows of fishes were hung upon lines one above the other to dry in the wind. The whole coast was strewn with spoilt herrings for there were so many of those fish that a net was scarcely thrown into the sea before they were caught by cartloads there were so many that often they were thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the shore.The old mans wife and daughter and his servants too came rejoicingly to meet him. There was a great pressing of hands and talking and questioning. And the daughter what a lovely face and bright eyes she hadThe interior of the house was roomy and comfortable. Fritters that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish were placed on the table and there was wine from the vineyard of Skjagenthat is the sea for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed and prepared in barrels and in bottles.When the mother and daughter heard who Jrgen was and how innocently he had suffered they looked at him in a still more friendly way and the eyes of the charming Clara were the friendliest of all. Jrgen found a happy home in Old Skjagen. It did his heart good and his heart had been sorely tried and had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens according to circumstances. Jrgens heart was still softit was young and there was still room in it and therefore it was well that Mistress Clara was going in three weeks in her fathers ship to Christiansand in Norway to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter.On the Sunday before her departure they all went to church to the holy Communion. The church was large and handsome and had been built centuries before by Scotchmen and Hollanders it lay at a little distance from the town. It was certainly somewhat ruinous and the road to it was heavy through the deep sand but the people gladly went through the difficulties to get to the house of God to sing psalms and hear the sermon. The sand had heaped itself up round the walls of the church but the graves were kept free from it.It was the largest church north of the Limfjord. The Virgin Mary with the golden crown on her head and the child Jesus in her arms stood lifelike upon the altar the holy Apostles had been carved in the choir and on the wall hung portraits of the old burgomasters and councillors of Skjagen the pulpit was of carved work. The sun shone brightly into the church and its radiance fell on the polished brass chandelier and on the little ship that hung from the vaulted roof.Jrgen felt as if overcome by a holy childlike feeling like that which possessed him when as a boy he had stood in the splendid Spanishcathedral but here the feeling was different for he felt conscious of being one of the congregation.After the sermon followed the holy Communion. He partook of the bread and wine and it happened that he knelt beside Mistress Clara but his thoughts were so fixed upon Heaven and the holy service that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from his knees and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks.Two days later she left Skjagen and went to Norway. He stayed behind and made himself useful in the house and in the business. He went out fishing and at that time fish were more plentiful and larger than now. Every Sunday when he sat in the church and his eye rested on the statue of the Virgin on the altar his glance rested for a time on the spot where Mistress Clara had knelt beside him and he thought of her how hearty and kind she had been to him.And so the autumn and the winter time passed away. There was wealth here and a real family life even down to the domestic animals who were all well kept. The kitchen glittered with copper and tin and white plates and from the roof hung hams and beef and winter stores in plenty. All this is still to be seen in many rich farms of the west coast of Jutland plenty to eat and drink clean decorated rooms clever heads happy tempers and hospitality prevail there as in an Arab tent.Never since the famous burial feast had Jrgen spent such a happy time and yet Mistress Clara was absent except in the thoughts and memory of all.In April a ship was to start for Norway and Jrgen was to sail in it. He was full of life and spirits and looked so stout and jovial that Dame Brnne declared it did her good to see him.And its a pleasure to see you too old wife said the old merchant. Jrgen has brought life into our winter evenings and into you too mother. You look younger this year and you seem well and bonny. But then you were once the prettiest girl in Wiborg and thats saying a great deal for I have always found the Wiborg girls the prettiest of any.Jrgen said nothing to this but he thought of a certain maiden of Skjagen and he sailed to visit that maiden for the ship steered to Christiansand in Norway and a favouring wind bore it rapidly to that town.One morning merchant Brnne went out to the lighthouse that stands far away from Old Skjagen the coal fire had long gone out and the sun was already high when he mounted the tower. The sandbanks extend under the water a whole mile from the shore. Outside these banks many ships were seen that day and with the help of his telescope the old man thought he descried his own vessel the Karen Brnne.Yes surely there she was and the ship was sailing up with Jrgen and Clara on board. The church and the lighthouse appeared to them as a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters. Clara sat on deck and saw the sandhills gradually looming forth if the wind held she might reach her home in about an hourso near were they to home and its joysso near were they to death and its terrors. For a plank in the ship gave way and the water rushed in. The crew flew to the pumps and attempted to stop the leak. A signal of distress was hoisted but they were still a full mile from the shore. Fishing boats were in sight but they were still far distant. The wind blew shoreward and the tide was in their favour too but all was insufficient for the ship sank. Jrgen threw his right arm about Clara and pressed her close to him.With what a look she gazed in his face As he threw himself in Gods name into the water with her she uttered a cry but still she felt safe certain that he would not let her sink.And now in the hour of terror and danger Jrgen experienced what the old song toldAnd written it stood how the brave kings sonEmbraced the bride his valour had won.How rejoiced he felt that he was a good swimmer He worked his way onward with his feet and with one hand while with the other he tightly held the young girl. He rested upon the waves he trod the water he practised all the arts he knew so as to reserve strength enough to reach the shore. He heard how Clara uttered a sigh and felt a convulsive shudder pass through her and he pressed her to him closer than ever. Now and then a wave rolled over her and he was still a few cables lengths from the land when help came in the shape of an approaching boat. But under the waterhe could see it clearlystood a white form gazing at him a wave lifted him up and the form approached him he felt a shock and it grew dark and everything vanished from his gaze.On the sandreef lay the wreck of a ship the sea washed over it the white figurehead leant against an anchor the sharp iron extended just to the surface. Jrgen had come in contact with this and the tide had driven him against it with double force. He sank down fainting with his load but the next wave lifted him and the young girl aloft again.The fishermen grasped them and lifted them into the boat. The blood streamed down over Jrgens face he seemed dead but he still clutchedthe girl so tightly that they were obliged to loosen her by force from his grasp. And Clara lay pale and lifeless in the boat that now made for the shore.All means were tried to restore Clara to life but she was dead For some time he had been swimming onward with a corpse and had exerted himself to exhaustion for one who was dead.Jrgen was still breathing. The fishermen carried him into the nearest house upon the sandhills. A kind of surgeon who lived there and was at the same time a smith and a general dealer bound up Jrgens wounds in a temporary way till a physician could be got next day from the nearest town.The brain of the sick man was affected. In delirium he uttered wild cries but on the third day he lay quiet and exhausted on his couch and his life seemed to hang by a thread and the physician said it would be best if this string snapped.Let us pray that God may take him to Himself he will never be a sane man againBut life would not depart from himthe thread would not snap but the thread of memory broke the thread of all his mental power had been cut through and what was most terrible a body remaineda living healthy bodythat wandered about like a spectre.Jrgen remained in the house of the merchant Brnne.He contracted his illness in his endeavour to save our child said the old man and now he is our son.People called Jrgen imbecile but that was not the right expression. He was like an instrument in which the strings are loose and will sound no more only at times for a few minutes they regained their power and then they sounded anew old melodies were heard snatches of song pictures unrolled themselves and then disappeared again in the mist and once more he sat staring before him without a thought. We may believe that he did not suffer but his dark eyes lost their brightness and looked only like black clouded glass.Poor imbecile Jrgen said the people.He it was whose life was to have been so pleasant that it would be presumption and pride to expect or believe in a higher existence hereafter. All his great mental faculties had been lost only hard days pain and disappointment had been his lot. He was like a rare plant torn from its native soil and thrown upon the sand to wither there. And was the image fashioned in Gods likeness to have no better destination Was it to be merely the sport of chance No. The allloving God would certainly repay him in the life to come forwhat he had suffered and lost here. The Lord is good to all and His mercy is over all His works. These words from the Psalms of David the old pious wife of the merchant repeated in patience and hope and the prayer of her heart was that Jrgen might soon be summoned to enter into the life eternal.In the churchyard where the sand blows across the walls Clara lay buried. It seemed as if Jrgen knew nothing of thisit did not come within the compass of his thoughts which comprised only fragments of a past time. Every Sunday he went with the old people to church and sat silent there with vacant gaze. One day while the Psalms were being sung he uttered a deep sigh and his eyes gleamed they were fixed upon the altar upon the place where he had knelt with his friend who was dead. He uttered her name and became pale as death and tears rolled over his cheeks.They led him out of the church and he said to the bystanders that he was well and had never been ill he the heavily afflicted the waif cast forth upon the world remembered nothing of his sufferings. And the Lord our Creator is wise and full of lovingkindnesswho can doubt itIn Spain where the warm breezes blow over the Moorish cupola among the orange trees and laurels where song and the sound of castagnettes are always heard sat in the sumptuous house a childish old man the richest merchant in the place while children marched in procession through the streets with waving flags and lighted tapers. How much of his wealth would the old man not have given to be able to press his children to his heart his daughter or her child that had perhaps never seen the light in this world far less a Paradise.Poor childYes poor childa child still and yet more than thirty years old for to that age Jrgen had attained in Old Skjagen.The drifting sand had covered the graves in the churchyard quite up to the walls of the church but yet the dead must be buried among their relations and loved ones who had gone before them. Merchant Brnne and his wife now rested here with their children under the white sand.It was springtime the season of storms. The sandhills whirled up in clouds and the sea ran high and flocks of birds flew like clouds in the storms shrieking across the dunes and shipwreck followed shipwreck on the reefs of Skjagenzweig from towards the Hunsby dunes. One evening Jrgen was sitting alone in the room. Suddenly his mind seemed to become clearer and a feeling of unrest came upon him which in his younger years had often driven him forth upon the heath and the sandhills.Home home he exclaimed. No one heard him. He went out of the house towards the dunes. Sand and stones blew into his face and whirled around him. He went on farther and farther towards the church the sand lay high around the walls half over the windows but the heap had been shovelled away from the door and the entrance was free and easy to open and Jrgen went into the church.The storm went howling over the town of Skjagen. Within the memory of man the sea had not run so higha terrible tempest but Jrgen was in the temple of God and while black night reigned without a light arose in his soul a light that was never to be extinguished he felt the heavy stone which seemed to weigh upon his head burst asunder. He thought he heard the sound of the organ but it was the storm and the moaning of the sea. He sat down on one of the seats and behold the candles were lighted up one by one a richness was displayed such as he had only seen in the church in Spain and all the pictures of the old councillors were endued with life and stepped forth from the walls against which they had stood for centuries and seated themselves in the entrance of the church.The gates and doors flew open and in came all the dead people festively clad and sat down to the sound of beautiful music and filled the seats in the church. Then the psalm tune rolled forth like a sounding sea and his old fosterparents from the Hunsby dunes were here and the old merchant Brnne and his wife and at their side close to Jrgen sat their friendly lovely daughter Clara who gave her hand to Jrgen and they both went to the altar where they had once knelt together and the priest joined their hands and joined them together for life. Then the sound of music was heard again wonderful like a childs voice full of joy and expectation and it swelled on to an organs sound to a tempest of full noble sounds lovely and elevating to hear and yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs.And the little ship that hung down from the roof of the choir came down and became wonderfully large and beautiful with silken sails and golden yards and every rope wrought through with silk as the old song said. The married pair went on board and the whole congregation with them for there was room and joyfulness for all. And the walls and arches of the church bloomed like the juniper and the fragrant lime trees and the leaves and branches waved and distributed coolness then they bent and parted and the ship sailed through the midst of them through the sea and through the air and every church taper became a star and the wind sang a psalm tune and all sang with the windIn love to gloryno life shall be lost. Full of blessedness and joy. HallelujahAnd these words were the last that Jrgen spoke in this world. The thread snapped that bound the immortal soul and nothing but a dead body lay in the dark church around which the storm raged covering it with loose sand.The next morning was Sunday and the congregation and their pastor went forth to the service. The road to church had been heavy the sand made the way almost impassable and now when they at last reached their goal a great hill of sand was piled up before the entrance and the church itself was buried. The priest spoke a short prayer and said that God had closed the door of this house and the congregation must go and build a new one for Him elsewhere.So they sang a psalm under the open sky and went back to their homes.Jrgen was nowhere to be found in the town of Skjagen or in the dunes however much they sought for him. It was thought that the waves which had rolled far up on the sand had swept him away.His body lay buried in a great sepulchre in the church itself. In the storm the Lords hand had thrown a handful of earth on his grave and the heavy mound of sand lay upon it and lies there to this day.The whirling sand had covered the high vaulted passages whitethorn and wild rose trees grow over the church over which the wanderer now walks while the tower standing forth like a gigantic tombstone over a grave is to be seen for miles around no king has a more splendid tombstone. No one disturbs the rest of the dead no one knew of this and we are the first who know of this gravethe storm sang the tale to me among the sandhills.
Once upon a time a fox lay peeping out of his hole watching the road that ran by at a little distance and hoping to see something that might amuse him for he was feeling very dull and rather cross. For a long while he watched in vain everything seemed asleep and not even a bird stirred overhead. The fox grew crosser than ever and he was just turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow. He crouched eagerly down at the edge of the road and said to himself I wonder what would happen if I were to pretend to be dead This is a man driving a reindeer sledge I know the tinkling of the harness. And at any rate I shall have an adventure and that is always somethingSo he stretched himself out by the side of the road carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him yet where the reindeer would not tread on him and all fell out just as he had expected. The sledgedriver pulled up sharply as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes. The fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily.But before they had gone very far the fox who was near the edge contrived to slip over and when the Laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind for it was marketday at the nearest town and the man had much to sell.They drove on a little further when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow. That beast is bewitched he said to himself and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all which had a cargo of fishes. This was exactly what the cunning creature wanted and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of the road.Now there were so many sledges that the Lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing indeed he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall. Then he got down to secure more firmly the cloths that kept his goods dry and going to the end of the long row discovered that the sledge containing the fish and the fox was missing. He quickly unharnessed one of his reindeer and rode back along the way he had come to find the sledge standing safe in the middle of the road but as the fox had bitten off the cord close to the noose there was no means of moving it away.The fox meanwhile was enjoying himself mightily. As soon as he had loosened the sledge he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale and had trotted off to the forest with it in his mouth. Byandby he met a bear who stopped and said Where did you find that fish Mr. FoxOh not far off answered he I just stuck my tail in the stream close by the place where the elves dwell and the fish hung on to it of itself.Dear me snarled the bear who was hungry and not in a good temper if the fish hung on to your tail I suppose he will hang on to mine.Yes certainly grandfather replied the fox if you have patience to suffer what I suffered.Of course I can replied the bear what nonsense you talk Show me the way.So the fox led him to the bank of a stream which being in a warm place had only lightly frozen in places and was at this moment glittering in the spring sunshine.The elves bathe here he said and if you put in your tail the fish will catch hold of it. But it is no use being in a hurry or you will spoil everything.Then he trotted off but only went out of sight of the bear who stood still on the bank with his tail deep in the water. Soon the sun set and it grew very cold and the ice formed rapidly and the bears tail was fixed as tight as if a vice had held it and when the fox saw that everything had happened just as he had planned it he called out loudlyBe quick good people and come with your bows and spears. A bear has been fishing in your brookAnd in a moment the whole place was full of little creatures each one with a tiny bow and a spear hardly big enough for a baby but both arrows and spears could sting as the bear knew very well and in his fright he gave such a tug to his tail that it broke short off and he rolled away into the forest as fast as his legs could carry him. At this sight the fox held his sides for laughing and then scampered away in another direction. Byand by he came to a fir tree and crept into a hole under the root. After that he did something very strange.Taking one of his hind feet between his two front paws he said softlyWhat would you do my foot if someone was to betray meI would run so quickly that he should not catch you.What would you do mine ear if someone was to betray meI would listen so hard that I should hear all his plans.What would you do my nose if someone was to betray meI would smell so sharply that I should know from afar that he was coming.What would you do my tail if someone was to betray meI would steer you so straight a course that you would soon be beyond his reach. Let us be off I feel as if danger was near.But the fox was comfortable where he was and did not hurry himself to take his tails advice. And before very long he found he was too late for the bear had come round by another path and guessing where his enemy was began to scratch at the roots of the tree. The fox made himself as small as he could but a scrap of his tail peeped out and the bear seized it and held it tight. Then the fox dug his claws into the ground but he was not strong enough to pull against the bear and slowly he was dragged forth and his body flung over the bears neck. In this manner they set out down the road the foxs tail being always in the bears mouth.After they had gone some way they passed a treestump on which a bright coloured woodpecker was tapping.Ah those were better times when I used to paint all the birds such gay colours sighed the fox.What are you saying old fellow asked the bear.I Oh I was saying nothing answered the fox drearily. Just carry me to your cave and eat me up as quick as you can.The bear was silent and thought of his supper and the two continued their journey till they reached another tree with a woodpecker tapping on it.Ah those were better times when I used to paint all the birds such gay colours said the fox again to himself.Couldnt you paint me too asked the bear suddenly.But the fox shook his head for he was always acting even if no one was there to see him do it.You bear pain so badly he replied in a thoughtful voice and you are impatient besides and could never put up with all that is necessary. Why you would first have to dig a pit and then twist ropes of willow and drive in posts and fill the hole with pitch and last of all set it on fire. Oh no you would never be able to do all that.It does not matter a straw how hard the work is answered the bear eagerly I will do it every bit. And as he spoke he began tearing up the earth so fast that soon a deep pit was ready deep enough to hold him.That is all right said the fox at last I see I was mistaken in you. Now sit here and I will bind you. So the bear sat down on the edge of the pit and the fox sprang on his back which he crossed with the willow ropes and then set fire to the pitch. It burnt up in an instant and caught the bands of willow and the bears rough hair but he did not stir for he thought that the fox was rubbing the bright colours into his skin and that he would soon be as beautiful as a whole meadow of flowers. But when the fire grew hotter still he moved uneasily from one foot to the other saying imploringly It is getting rather warm old man. But all the answer he got was I thought you would never be able to suffer pain like those little birds.The bear did not like being told that he was not as brave as a bird so he set his teeth and resolved to endure anything sooner than speak again but by this time the last willow band had burned through and with a push the fox sent his victim tumbling into the grass and ran off to hide himself in the forest. After a while he stole cautiously and found as he expected nothing left but a few charred bones. These he picked up and put in a bag which he slung over his back.Byandby he met a Lapp driving his team of reindeer along the road and as he drew near the fox rattled the bones gaily.That sounds like silver or gold thought the man to himself. And he said politely to the foxGoodday friend What have you got in your bag that makes such a strange soundAll the wealth my father left me answered the fox. Do you feel inclined to bargainWell I dont mind replied the Lapp who was a prudent man and did not wish the fox to think him too eager but show me first what money you have got.Ah but I cant do that answered the fox my bag is sealed up. But if you will give me those three reindeer you shall take it as it is with all its contents.The Lapp did not quite like it but the fox spoke with such an air that his doubts melted away. He nodded and stretched out his hand the fox put the bag into it and unharnassed the reindeer he had chosen.Oh I forgot he exclaimed turning round as he was about to drive them in the opposite direction you must be sure not to open the bag until you have gone at least five miles right on the other side of those hills out there. If you do you will find that all the gold and silver has changed into a parcel of charred bones. Then he whipped up his reindeer and was soon out of sight.For some time the Lapp was satisfied with hearing the bones rattle and thinking to himself what a good bargain he had made and of all the things he would buy with the money. But after a bit this amusement ceased to content him and besides what was the use of planning when you did not know for certain how rich you were Perhaps there might be a great deal of silver and only a little gold in the bag or a great deal of gold and only a little silver. Who could tell He would not of course take the money out to count it for that might bring him bad luck. But there could be no harm in just one peep So he slowly broke the seal and untied the strings and behold a heap of burnt bones lay before him In a minute he knew he had been tricked and flinging the bag to the ground in a rage he ran after the fox as fast as his snowshoes would carry him.Now the fox had guessed exactly what would happen and was on the look out. Directly he saw the little speck coming towards him he wished that the mans snowshoes might break and that very instant the Lapps shoes snapped in two. The Lapp did now know that this was the foxs work but he had to stop and fetch one of his other reindeer which he mounted and set off again in pursuit of his enemy. The fox soon heard him coming and this time he wished that the reindeer might fall and break its leg. And so it did and the man felt it was a hopeless chase and that he was no match for the fox.So the fox drove on in peace till he reached the cave where all his stores were kept and then he began to wonder whom he could get to help him kill his reindeer for though he could steal reindeer he was too small to kill them. After all it will be quite easy thought he and he bade a squirrel who was watching him on a tree close by take a message to all the robber beasts of the forest and in less than half an hour a great crashing of branches was heard and bears wolves snakes mice frogs and other creatures came pressing up to the cave.When they heard why they had been summoned they declared themselves ready each one to do his part. The bear took his crossbow from his neck and shot the reindeer in the chin and from that day to this every reindeer has a mark in that same spot which is always known as the bears arrow. The wolf shot him in the thigh and the sign of his arrow still remains and so with the mouse and the viper and all the rest even the frog and at the last the reindeer all died. And the fox did nothing but looked on.I really must go down to the brook and wash myself said he though he was perfectly clean and he went under the bank and hid himself behind a stone. From there he set up the most frightful shrieks so that the animals fled away in all directions. Only the mouse and the ermine remained where they were for they thought that they were much too small to be noticed.The fox continued his shrieks till he felt sure that the animals must have got to a safe distance then he crawled out of his hidingplace and went to the bodies of the reindeer which he now had all to himself. He gathered a bundle of sticks for a fire and was just preparing to cook a steak when his enemy the Lapp came up panting with haste and excitement.What are you doing there cried he why did you palm off those bones on me And why when you had got the reindeer did you kill themDear brother answered the fox with a sob do not blame me for this misfortune. It is my comrades who have slain them in spite of my prayers.The man made no reply for the white fur of the ermine who was crouching with the mouse behind some stones had just caught his eye. He hastily seized the iron hook which hung over the fire and flung it at the little creature but the ermine was too quick for him and the hook only touched the top of its tail and that has remained black to this day. As for the mouse the Lapp threw a halfburnt stick after him and though it was not enough to hurt him his beautiful white skin was smeared all over with it and all the washing in the world would not make him clean again. And the man would have been wiser if he had let the ermine and the mouse alone for when he turned round again he found he was alone.Directly the fox noticed that his enemys attention had wandered from himself he watched his chance and stole softly away till he had reached a clump of thick bushes when he ran as fast as he could till he reached a river where a man was mending his boat.Oh I wish I wish I had a boat to mend too he cried sitting up on his hindlegs and looking into the mans face.Stop your silly chatter answered the man crossly or I will give you a bath in the river.Oh I wish I do wish I had a boat to mend cried the fox again as if he had not heard. And the man grew angry and seized him by the tail and threw him far out in the stream close to the edge of an island which was just what the fox wanted. He easily scrambled up and sitting on the top he called Hasten hasten O fishes and carry me to the other side And the fishes left the stones where they had been sleeping and the pools where they had been feeding and hurried to see who could get to the island first.I have won shouted the pike. Jump on my back dear fox and you will find yourself in a trice on the opposite shore.No thank you answered the fox your back is much too weak for me. I should break it.Try mine said the eel who had wriggled to the front.No thank you replied the fox again I should slip over your head and be drowned.You wont slip on MY back said the perch coming forward.No but you are really TOO rough returned the fox.Well you can have no fault to find with ME put in the trout.Good gracious are YOU here exclaimed the fox. But Im afraid to trust myself to you either.At this moment a fine salmon swam slowly up.Ah yes you are the person I want said the fox but come near so that I may get on your back without wetting my feet.So the salmon swam close under the island and when he was touching it the fox seized him in his claws and drew him out of the water and put him on a spit while he kindled a fire to cook him by. When everything was ready and the water in the pot was getting hot he popped him in and waited till he thought the salmon was nearly boiled. But as he stooped down the water gave a sudden fizzle and splashed into the foxs eyes blinding him. He started backwards with a cry of pain and sat still for some minutes rocking himself to and fro. When he was a little better he rose and walked down a road till he met a grouse who stopped and asked what was the matter.Have you a pair of eyes anywhere about you asked the fox politely.No I am afraid I havent answered the grouse and passed on.A little while after the fox heard the buzzing of an early bee whom a gleam of sun had tempted out.Do you happen to have an extra pair of eyes anywhere asked the fox.I am sorry to say I have only those I am using replied the bee. And the fox went on till he nearly fell over an asp who was gliding across the road.I should be SO glad if you would tell me where I could get a pair of eyes said the fox. I suppose you dont happen to have any you could lend meWell if you only want them for a short time perhaps I could manage answered the asp but I cant do without them for long.Oh it is only for a very short time that I need them said the fox I have a pair of my own just behind that hill and when I find them I will bring yours back to you. Perhaps you will keep these till them. So he took the eyes out of his own head and popped them into the head of the asp and put the asps eyes in their place. As he was running off he cried over his shoulder As long as the world lasts the asps eyes will go down in the heads of foxes from generation to generation.And so it has been and if you look at the eyes of an asp you will see that they are all burnt and though thousands and thousands of years have gone by since the fox was going about playing tricks upon everybody he met the asp still bears the traces of the day when the sly creature cooked the salmon.
There was once a Sultan who was so pious and devout that he spent many hours every day in prayer.For the glory of Allah he thought to himself I ought to build the most beautiful mosque in the world.So he called together the finest artisans in the country and told them what he wanted. He spent a third of his riches on the undertaking and when the mosque was finished everybody saidSee now our Sultan has built the most beautiful mosque in the world for the greater glory of AllahOn the first day when the Sultan went to pray in the new mosque a Dervish who was sitting crosslegged at the entrance spoke to him in a droning singsong voice and saidNay but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailingThe words of the holy man grieved the Sultan and he had the mosque torn down and another built in its place even more beautiful.This is certainly the most beautiful mosque in the world the people said and the Sultans heart was very happy on the first day as he went in to pray.But again the Dervish seated at the entrance said to him in his droning singsong voiceNay but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailingAt the holy mans words the Sultan had the second mosque torn down and a third one built the most beautiful of them all. But when it was finished for a third time the Dervish droned outNay but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailingWhat can I do the Sultan cried. I have spent all my riches and now I have no means wherewith to build another mosqueHe fell to grieving and nothing any one could say would comfort him.His three sons came to him and saidFather is there not something we can do for youThe Sultan sighed and shook his head.Nothing my sons unless indeed you were to find out for me why my third mosque is not the most beautiful in the world.Brothers the youngest suggested let us go to the Dervish and ask him why it is that the third mosque is not yet beautiful enough. Perhaps he will tell us what is lacking.So they went to the Dervish and asked him what he meant by saying to the Sultan that the third mosque was not yet beautiful enough and they begged him to tell them what it was that was lacking.The Dervish fixed his eyes in the distance and slightly swaying his body back and forth answered them in his singsong tone.The mosque is beautiful he said and the fountain in its midst is beautiful but where is the glorious Nightingale Gisar With the Nightingale Gisar singing beside the fountain then indeed would the Sultans third mosque be the most beautiful mosque in the worldOnly tell us where this glorious Nightingale is the brothers begged and we will get him if it costs us our livesI cannot tell you that the Dervish droned. You will have to go out into the world and find him for yourselves.So the three brothers returned to the Sultan and told him what the Dervish had said.All your third mosque lacks to be the most beautiful mosque in the world they told him is the Nightingale Gisar singing beside the fountain. So grieve no more father. We your three sons will go out into the world in quest of this glorious bird and within a years time we will return with the bird in our hands if so be that it is anywhere to be found in all the wide world.The Sultan blessed them and they set forth the three of them side by side. They traveled together until they reached a place where three roads branched. Upon the stone of the lefthand road nothing was written. Upon the stone of the middle road was the inscription Who goes this way returns. The inscription on the third stone read Who goes this way shall meet many dangers and may never return.Let us part here the oldest brother said and each take a separate road. Then if all goes well let us meet here again on this same spot one year hence. As our fathers oldest son it would be wrong for me to run unnecessary risks so I will take the lefthand road.And I will take the middle road the second brother cried.The Youngest Brother laughed and saidThat leaves the dangerous road for me Very well brothers thats the very road I wish to take for why should I leave home if it were not to have adventures Farewell then until we meet again in one years time.The oldest traveled his safe road until he reached a city where he became a barber. He asked every man whose head he shavedDo you know anything of the Nightingale GisarHe never found any one who had even heard of the bird so after a time he stopped asking.The second brother followed the middle road to a city where he settled down and opened a coffeehouse.Have you ever heard of a glorious Nightingale known as Gisar he asked at first of every traveler who came in and sipped his coffee. Not one of them ever had and as time went by the second brother gradually stopped even making inquiries.The Youngest Brother who took the dangerous road came to no city at all but to a faroff desolate place without houses or highways or farms. Wild creatures hid in the brush and snakes glided in and out among the rocks. One day he came upon a wild woman who was combing her hair with a branch of juniper.That isnt the way to comb your hair the Youngest Brother said. Here let me show you.He took his own comb and smoothed out all the tangles in the wild womans hair until she was comfortable and happy.You have been very kind to me she said. Now isnt there something I can do for you in returnI am looking for the Nightingale Gisar. If you know where that glorious bird is tell me and that will more than repay me.But the wild woman had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar.Only wild animals inhabit this desolate place she said and a few wild people like me. The Nightingale Gisar is not here.Then I must go farther the Youngest Brother said.This the wild woman begged him not to do.Beyond these mountains she said is a wilder desert with fiercer animals. Turn back while you can.No the Youngest Brother insisted Im going as God leads me.So he left the wild woman and crossed the mountains. He went on and on until he was footsore and weary. Then at last he came to the Tigers house.The Tigers wife met him.Be off young man she warned him or the Tiger when he comes home will eat youNo said the Youngest Brother now Im here Im going to stay for I have a question to ask the Tiger.The Tigers wife was making bread. When the dough was ready to go into the oven she leaned over the glowing embers of the fire and began to brush them aside with her body.Stop the Youngest Brother cried. You will burn yourselfBut how else can I brush aside the glowing embers the Tigers wife asked.Ill show you.The Youngest Brother cut a branch from a tree outside and fashioned it into a rough broom. Then he showed the Tigers wife how to use it.Ah she said gratefully before this always when Ive baked bread Ive been sick for ten days afterwards. Now I shall be sick no more for you have taught me how to use a broom. In return let me hide you in a dark corner and when the Tiger comes home Ill tell him how kind you have been and perhaps he will not eat you.So she hid the Youngest Brother in a dark corner and when the Tiger came home she met him and saidSee I have baked bread today but I am not sick for a youth has shown me how I can brush aside the embers without burning myself.The Tiger was overjoyed to hear that his wife had been able to bake bread without being made sick and he swore to be a brother to him who had taught her the use of a broom. So the Youngest Brother came out from the dark corner where he was hiding and the Tiger made him welcome.What are you doing wandering about in this wild country the Tiger asked.I am searching for the Nightingale Gisar and I have come to you to ask you if you can tell me where I can find that glorious bird.The Tiger had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar but he thought that his oldest brother the Lion might know.Go straight on from here he said until you come to the Lions house. His old wife stands outside facing the house with her long thin old dugs thrown over her shoulders. Go up to her from behind and take her dugs and put them in your mouth and suck them and when she asks you who you are say Dont you know me old mother Im your oldest cub. Then she will lead you in to the Lion who is so old that his eyelids droop. Prop them open and when he sees you he will tell you what he knows.So the Youngest Brother went on to the Lions house and he found the Lions old wife standing outside as the Tiger said he would. He did all the Tiger had told him to do and when the Lions wife asked him who he was he said Dont you know me old mother Im your oldest cub. Then the Lions old wife led him in to the Lion and he propped open the Lions drooping eyelids and asked about the Nightingale Gisar.The old Lion shook his head.I have never heard of the Nightingale Gisar. He has never sung in this wild place. Turn back young man and seek him elsewhere. Beyond this is a country of wilder creatures where you will only lose your life.That is as God wills the Youngest Brother said.With that he bade the old Lion and his old wife farewell and pushed on into the farther wilds. The mountains grew more and more rugged the plains more parched and barren and the Youngest Son was hard put to it to find food from day to day.Once when he was crossing a desert three eagles swooped down upon him and it was all he could do to fight them off. He slashed at them with his sword and succeeded in cutting off the beak of one a wing of another and a leg of the third. He put these three things in his bag as trophies.He came at last to a hut where an old woman was baking cakes on the hearth.God bless you granny he said. Can you give me a bite of supper and shelter for the nightThe old woman shook her head.My boy you had better not stop here. I have three daughters and if they were to come home and find you here theyd kill you.But the Youngest Brother insisted that he was not afraid and at last the old woman let him stay. She hid him in the corner behind the firewood and warned him to keep still.Presently the three eagles whom he had maimed came flying into the hut. The old woman put a bowl of milk on the table the birds dipped in the milk and lo their feather shirts opened and they stepped out three maidens. One of them had lost her lips one an arm and the third a leg.Ah they cried to their mother see what has befallen us If only the youth who maimed us would re turn the beak and the wing and the leg that he hacked off we would tell him anything he wants to know.At that the Youngest Brother stepped out from behind the firewood and saidTell me then where I can find the Nightingale Gisar and you shall have back your beak and your wing and your leg.He opened his bag and the maidens were overjoyed to see their beak and their wing and their leg. Then they told the Youngest Brother all they knew about the Nightingale Gisar.Far from here they said there is a Warrior Princess so beautiful that men call her Flower o the World. She has the Nightingale Gisar in a golden cage hanging in her own chamber. The chamber door is guarded by a lion and a wolf and a tiger for the Flower o the World knows that she will have to marry the man who steals from her the Nightingale Gisar.How can a man enter the chamber of the Flower o the World the Youngest Brother asked.For a few moments at midnight the sisters told him the three animals sleep. During those few moments a man could enter the chamber get the Nightingale Gisar and escape. But even then he might not be safe for the Flower o the World might gather her army together and pursue him.Now tell me how to reach the palace of that Warrior Princess Flower o the World.You could never get there alone they told him the way is too long and the dangers are too many. Stay here with us for three months and at the end of three months we will carry you thither on our wings.So for three months the Youngest Brother stayed on in the hut with the old woman and her three daughters. The three daughters flew in their eagle shirts to the spring of the Water of Life and bathing in that magic pool they made grow on again the beak and the wing and the leg which the Youngest Brother had hacked off.At the end of three months they carried the Youngest Brother on their wings to the distant kingdom where the Warrior Princess Flower o the World lived.At midnight they set him down in front of the palace and he slipped unseen through the guards at the gate and through the halls of the palace to the Princesss own chamber. The lion the wolf and the tiger were asleep and he was able to push back the curtain before which they were lying and creep up to the Princesss very bedside without being discovered.He looked once at the sleeping Flower o the World and she was so beautiful that he dared not look again for fear he should forget the Nightingale Gisar and betray himself by crying out.At the head of the bed were four lighted candles and at the foot four unlighted ones. He blew out the lighted ones and lit the others. Then quickly he took the golden cage in which the Nightingale Gisar was perched asleep unfastened it from the golden chain on which it was hanging and hurried out. The eagles were waiting for him and at once they spread their wings and carried him away.They put him down at the crossroads where he had parted from his brothers just one year before. Then they bade him farewell and flew off to their home in the desert.My brothers will probably be here in an hour or so the Youngest Son thought. I had better wait for them.He felt sleepy so he lay down by the roadside and closed his eyes.While he slept his brothers arrived and of course the first thing they saw was the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar.Then envy and hatred filled their hearts and they began cursing and complaining to think that he who was the Youngest had succeeded where they had failed.Well be the laughingstock of the whole country they said if we let him come home carrying the Nightingale Gisar Let us take the bird while he sleeps and hurry home with it. Then if he comes home later and says it was he who really found the bird no one will believe him.So they beat their brother into insensibility and tore his clothes to rags to make him think that he had been set upon by robbers and then taking the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar they hurried home and presented themselves to their father the Sultan.Here O father they said is the Nightingale Gisar To get this glorious bird for you we have endured all the perils in the worldAnd your Youngest Brother the Sultan asked where is heThe Youngest Think no more of him father for he is unworthy to be your son. Instead of searching the wide world for the Nightingale Gisar he settled down in the first city he reached and lived a life of idleness and ease. Some say he became a barber and some say he opened a coffeehouse and spent his days chatting with passing travelers. He has not come home with us for no doubt it shames him to know that we have succeeded where he has failed.The Sultan was grieved to hear this evil report of his Youngest Son but he was overjoyed to have the Nightingale Gisar. He had the golden cage carried to the mosque and hung beside the fountain in the court.But imagine his disappointment when the bird refused to singLet him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque the Dervish said in his droning singsong voice and then the Nightingale will sing.The Sultan immediately sent for his two sons. They came but still the bird was silent.See now the Sultan said my two sons are here and yet the bird is silent.But the Dervish would only repeatLet him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.The next day a youth in rags whom nobody knew entered the mosque to pray and instantly the Nightingale began to sing.A messenger was sent running to the Sultan with the news that the Nightingale was singing. The Sultan hurried to the mosque but by the time he got there the beggar youth was gone and the Nightingale had stopped singing.Now that Im here cried the Sultan why does the bird not singThe Dervish swaying his body gently back and forth made answer as beforeLet him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.Thereafter every day when the beggar youth came to the mosque to pray the Nightingale sang and always when the Sultan approached the beggar walked away and the bird stopped singing. At last people began whisperingStrange that the Nightingale should sing only when that beggar youth is near And yet the Dervish says it will not sing unless he who found it comes to the mosque What can he meanReport of the beggar youth reached the ears of the Sultan and he went to the Dervish and questioned him.Why do you say that the Nightingale Gisar will not sing unless he who found him comes to the mosque Lo here are my two sons who found him and the bird remains silent yet people tell me that when a certain beggar comes to the mosque he sings. Why does he not sing when I and my two sons come to prayAnd always the Dervish made the same answer in the same singsong voiceLet him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.Soon a terrifying rumor spread through the land that a great Warrior Princess called Flower o the World was coming with a mighty army to make war on the Sultan and to destroy his city. Her army far outnumbered the Sultans and when she encamped in a broad valley over against the city the Sultans people seeing her mighty hosts were filled with dread and besought their ruler to make peace with the Princess at any cost. So the Sultan called his heralds and sent them to her and through them he saidDemand of me what you will even to my life but spare my city.The Warrior Princess returned this answerI will spare you and your city provided you deliver me your son who stole from me the Nightingale Gisar. Him I shall have executed or let live as it pleases me.Now the Sultans two sons knew that the Flower o the World was fated to marry the man who had stolen from her the Nightingale Gisar so when they heard the Princesss demand they were overjoyed thinking that she would have to fall in love with one of them. So they disputed at great length as to which of them had done the actual deed of taking the bird each insisting that it was he and not his brother. The Sultan himself had finally to decide between them.You have told me he said that you captured the bird together. As that is the case and as I cant send you both to the Warrior Princess it is only right that the older should go.So under a splendid escort the oldest son rode to the tent of the Warrior Princess. She bade him enter alone and when he appeared before her she looked at him long and steadily. Then she saidNay but you are never the man who stole from me the Nightingale Gisar You would lack the courage to face the perils of the wayThe oldest prince answered the Flower o the World craftilyBut how Princess if I did not steal from you the Nightingale Gisar was I then able to bring back that glorious bird and hang his cage beside the fountain in the mosqueBut Flower o the World was not to be deceived by such specious words.Tell me then she said if it was you who stole my glorious Nightingale where did you find him hanging in his golden cageThe oldest prince could not answer this so he said at randomI found his golden cage hanging in the cypress tree that grows in the garden of your palace.Enough cried the Princess.She clapped her hands and when her guards appeared she said to themHave this man executed at once and let his head be sent to the Sultan with the message This is the head of a liar and a coward Send me at once your son who stole my glorious Nightingale Gisar or I will march against your cityThe Sultan was greatly shocked to receive this message together with the head of his oldest son.Alas he cried calling his second son would that I had listened to you when you insisted that it was you and not your brother who actually did the deed Unhappily I listened to your brother See now the awful result of this mistake Go you now to this heartless Princess whom men call Flower o the World or else our poor defenseless city will have to pay the penalty.So the second prince was taken to the tent of the Warrior Maiden and she put to him the same questions and he fared even worse than his brother had fared. So his head too was sent to the Sultan with this messageSend me no more liars and cowards but the son who actually did steal from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar.In despair the Sultan went to the mosque to pray. As he bowed his head he heard the Nightingale burst forth in song. Then when he looked up he saw a beggar youth standing near the fountain.When his prayers were finished the Sultan went outside to the Dervish and said to himThe Warrior Princess Flower o the World demands that I send her another son. I know not where my Third Son is. What shall I doWithout looking at the Sultan the Dervish answered in his singsong voiceSend her the son for whom the Nightingale sings.The Sultan turned away in disappointment not understanding what the Dervish meant but one of his attendants plucked his sleeve and whisperedThe Nightingale sings for yonder beggar youth. Perhaps it is he the Dervish means. Why not ask him if he will go to Flower o the World in place of your Youngest SonThe Sultan nodded so the attendant called the beggar youth and the Sultan asked him would he go to the Warrior Princess as the Youngest Prince.Allah alone knows where my Youngest Son is the Sultan said but he is just about your age and if you were washed and anointed and dressed in fitting garments you would not be unlike him.The beggar youth said he would go but he insisted on going just as he was. The Sultan begged him to go dressed as a prince or the Flower o the World might not receive him.No said the youth I shall go as a beggar or not at all. It is for the Flower o the World to know me whether or not I am the Sultans Youngest Son and the man who stole from her the Nightingale Gisar.So he went as he was to the tent of the Flower o the World and her warriors when they saw him coming said to the PrincessThis Sultan mocks you and sends you a beggar when you demand his Third Son.But the Flower o the World ordered them all out and bade the beggar enter alone. She looked at him long and steadily and she saw through his rags that he was indeed a noble youth with a body made strong and beautiful through exercise and toil and she thought to herselfIt were not a hard fate to marry this youthThen she questioned himAre you the Sultans Third SonThen why are you dressed as a beggarBecause I was set upon at the crossroads and beaten insensible and my clothes torn to rags. I was coming home with the Nightingale Gisar in my hands and I lay down at the roadside to rest while I awaited the coming of my brothers. When I awoke to consciousness the Nightingale and its golden cage were gone. I came home to my fathers city as a beggar and there they told me that my brothers had come just before me bringing with them the Nightingale and boasting of the perils they had been through and the dangers they had faced. But the Nightingale they told me hanging in its golden cage beside the fountain was silent. Yet when I went to the mosque it always sang.The Warrior Princess looked deep into his eyes and knew that he was speaking truth. Her heart was touched with compassion at the wrong he had suffered from his brothers but she hid her feelings and questioned him further.Then it was you she said who really took from me my glorious Nightingale GisarYes Princess it was. I crept past the lion and the wolf and the tiger just after midnight while they slept. I blew out the four candles at the head of your bed and lighted those at the foot. The golden cage of the Nightingale was hanging from a golden chain. Before I unfastened it I looked at you once as you lay sleeping and dared not look a second time.Why not the Princess asked.Because O Flower o the World you were so beautiful that I feared were I to look again I should forget the Nightingale Gisar and cry out in ecstacy.Then the compassion in the Princesss heart changed to love and she knew for a certainty that this was the man she was fated to wed.She clapped her hands and when the guards came in she said to themCall my warriors together that I may show them the Sultans Youngest Son and the man who stole from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar and whom I am fated to wed.So the warriors came in until they crowded the tent to its utmost. Then the Princess stood up and took the Sultans Youngest Son by the hand and presented him to the warriors and told them of his great bravery and courage and of all the perils he had endured in order to get the Nightingale Gisar for his fathers mosque.He came to me now as a beggar she said but I knew him at once for truth was in his mouth and courage in his eye. Behold O warriors your future lordThen the warriors waved their swords and criedLong live the Flower o the World Long live the Sultans Youngest SonAll the Princesss army when they heard the news raised such a mighty shout that the people in the Sultans city heard and were filled with dread not knowing what it meant. But soon they knew and then they too went mad with joy that what had threatened to be a war was turning to a weddingThe Flower o the World and her chief warriors and with them the Youngest Prince rode slowly to the city. The Prince was now dressed as befitted his rank and the Sultan when he saw him recognized him at once.Allah be praised he cried my Youngest Son livesThen they told him allhow it was this Prince and not the older brothers who had found the Nightingale Gisar and how the older brothers had robbed him of his prize and beaten him insensible.When the Sultan heard how wicked his older sons had been his grief for their death was assuaged.Allah be praised he said that I have at least one son who is worthyAfter the betrothal ceremony the Sultan and the Youngest Prince went to the mosque to pray. While they prayed the Nightingale sang so gloriously that it seemed to them they were no longer on earth but in Paradise.When their prayers were finished and they were passing out the Dervish raised his singsong voice and saidNow indeed is the Sultans Mosque the most beautiful Mosque in the World for the Nightingale Gisar sings beside the Fountain
In ancient times a great many giant eagles or thunderbirds lived in the mountains but in later years they had all disappeared except one single pair which made their home in the mountain top overlooking the Yukon near Sabotnisky. The top of this mountain was round and the eagles had hollowed out a great basin on the summit which they used for a nest. Around the edge of it was a rocky rim from which they could see far across the broad river or could look down upon the village at the base of the mountain on the waters edge.From their perch on this rocky wall these great birds would soar away looking like a cloud in the sky to seize a reindeer from a passing herd and bring it to their young. Or again they would circle out with a noise like thunder from their shaking wings and drop down upon a fisherman in his kayak on the river carrying man and boat to the top of the mountain. There the man would be eaten by the young thunderbirds and the kayak would lie bleaching among the bones and other refuse scattered along the border of the nest. Every fall the young birds would fly away to the northland while the old ones would remain by the mountain.After many fishermen had been carried away by the birds there came a time when only the most daring would venture upon the river. One summer day a brave young hunter was starting out to look at his fish traps and he said to his wife Dont go outside the house while I am away for fear of the birds.After he was gone she noticed that the water tub was empty and took a bucket to go to the river for water. As she bent over to fill the vessel a roaring noise like thunder filled the air and one of the birds darted down and seized her in its talons. The villagers saw the bird swoop down and they wailed aloud in sorrow and terror as they watched her being carried through the air to the mountain top.The hunter came home and the villagers gathered about with many lamentations. Oh pitiful pitiful your pretty wife was carried away by the thunderbirds Too bad Too bad By this time she is torn to pieces and fed to the young demonsNot one word did the husband utter. Going into his empty house he took down his bow and his quiver of war arrows and started toward the mountain.Dont go Dont go cried the villagers of what use is it She is dead and devoured ere this. You will only add one more to their victims.Not a word did the hunter reply. He strode on and on and they watched him climbing up and up the mountainside till he was lost to view. At last he gained the rim of the nest and looked in. The old birds were away but the fierce young eagles greeted him with shrill cries and fiery flashing eyes. The hunters heart was full of anger and he quickly bent his bow loosing the war arrows one after another till the last one of the hateful birds lay dead in the nest.With heart still burning for revenge the hunter hid himself beside a great rock near the nest and waited for the parent birds. They came. They saw their young lying dead and bloody in the nest and their cries of rage echoed from the cliffs on the farther side of the great river. They soared up into the air looking for the one who had killed their young. Quickly they saw the brave hunter beside the great stone and the mother bird swooped down upon him her wings sounding like a gale in a spruce forest. Swiftly fitting an arrow to the string as the eagle came down the hunter sent it deep into her throat. With a hoarse cry she turned and flew away over the hills far to the north.The father bird had been circling overhead and came roaring down upon the hunter who at the right moment crouched close to the ground behind the stone and the eagles sharp claws struck only the hard rock. As the bird arose eager to swoop down again the hunter sprang from his shelter and drove two heavy war arrows deep under its wing. Uttering hoarse cries of rage and spreading his broad wings the thunderbird floated away like a cloud in the sky far into the northland and was never seen again.Having taken blood vengeance the hunter went down into the nest where among ribs of old canoes and other bones he found some fragments of his wife which he carried to the waters edge and building a fire made food offerings and libations of water such as would be pleasing to her ghost.
Once upon a time there lived a King and Queen who loved one another dearly. Indeed the Queen whose name was Santorina was so pretty and so kindhearted that it would have been a wonder if her husband had not been fond of her while King Gridelin himself was a perfect bundle of good qualities for the Fairy who presided at his christening had summoned the shades of all his ancestors and taken something good from each of them to form his character. Unfortunately though she had given him rather too much kindness of heart which is a thing that generally gets its possessor into trouble but so far all things had prospered with King Gridelin. However it was not to be expected such good fortune could last and before very long the Queen had a lovely little daughter who was named Placida. Now the King who thought that if she resembled her mother in face and mind she would need no other gift never troubled to ask any of the Fairies to her christening and this offended them mortally so that they resolved to punish him severely for thus depriving them of their rights. So to the despair of King Gridelin the Queen first of all became very ill and then disappeared altogether. If it had not been for the little Princess there is no saying what would have become of him he was so miserable but there she was to be brought up and luckily the good Fairy Lolotte in spite of all that had passed was willing to come and take charge of her and of her little cousin Prince Vivien who was an orphan and had been placed under the care of his uncle King Gridelin when he was quite a baby. Although she neglected nothing that could possibly have been done for them their characters as they grew up plainly proved that education only softens down natural defects but cannot entirely do away with them for Placida who was perfectly lovely and with a capacity and intelligence which enabled her to learn and understand anything that presented itself was at the same time as lazy and indifferent as it is possible for anyone to be while Vivien on the contrary was only too lively and was for ever taking up some new thing and as promptly tiring of it and flying off to something else which held his fickle fancy an equally short time. As these two children would possibly inherit the kingdom it was natural that their people should take a great interest in them and it fell out that all the tranquil and peaceloving citizens desired that Placida should one day be their Queen while the rash and quarrelsome hoped great things for Vivien. Such a division of ideas seemed to promise civil wars and all kinds of troubles to the State and even in the Palace the two parties frequently came into collision. As for the children themselves though they were too well brought up to quarrel still the difference in all their tastes and feelings made it impossible for them to like one another so there seemed no chance of their ever consenting to be married which was a pity since that was the only thing that would have satisfied both parties. Prince Vivien was fully aware of the feeling in his favour but being too honourable to wish to injure his pretty cousin and perhaps too impatient and volatile to care to think seriously about anything he suddenly took it into his head that he would go off by himself in search of adventure. Luckily this idea occurred to him when he was on horseback for he would certainly have set out on foot rather than lose an instant. As it was he simply turned his horses head without another thought than that of getting out of the kingdom as soon as possible. This abrupt departure was a great blow to the State especially as no one had any idea what had become of the Prince. Even King Gridelin who had never cared for anything since the disappearance of Queen Santorina was roused by this new loss and though he could not so much as look at the Princess Placida without shedding floods of tears he resolved to see for himself what talents and capabilities she showed. He very soon found out that in addition to her natural indolence she was being as much indulged and spoilt day by day as if the Fairy had been her grandmother and was obliged to remonstrate very seriously upon the subject. Lolotte took his reproaches meekly and promised faithfully that she would not encourage the Princess in her idleness and indifference any more. From this moment poor Placidas troubles began She was actually expected to choose her own dresses to take care of her jewels and to find her own amusements but rather than take so much trouble she wore the same old frock from morning till night and never appeared in public if she could possibly avoid it. However this was not all King Gridelin insisted that the affairs of the kingdom should be explained to her and that she should attend all the councils and give her opinion upon the matter in hand whenever it was asked of her and this made her life such a burden to her that she implored Lolotte to take her away from a country where too much was required of an unhappy Princess.The Fairy refused at first with a great show of firmness but who could resist the tears and entreaties of anyone so pretty as Placida It came to this in the end that she transported the Princess just as she was cosily tucked up upon her favourite couch to her own Grotto and this new disappearance left all the people in despair and Gridelin went about looking more distracted than ever. But now let us return to Prince Vivien and see what his restless spirit has brought him to. Though Placidas kingdom was a large one his horse had carried him gallantly to the limit of it but it could go no further and the Prince was obliged to dismount and continue his journey on foot though this slow mode of progress tired his patience severely.After what seemed to him a very long time he found himself all alone in a vast forest so dark and gloomy that he secretly shuddered however he chose the most promising looking path he could find and marched along it courageously at his best speed but in spite of all his efforts night fell before he reached the edge of the wood.For some time he stumbled along keeping to the path as well as he could in the darkness and just as he was almost wearied out he saw before him a gleam of light.This sight revived his drooping spirits and he made sure that he was now close to the shelter and supper he needed so much but the more he walked towards the light the further away it seemed sometimes he even lost sight of it altogether and you may imagine how provoked and impatient he was by the time he finally arrived at the miserable cottage from which the light proceeded. He gave a loud knock at the door and an old womans voice answered from within but as she did not seem to be hurrying herself to open it he redoubled his blows and demanded to be let in imperiously quite forgetting that he was no longer in his own kingdom. But all this had no effect upon the old woman who only noticed all the uproar he was making by saying gentlyYou must have patience.He could hear that she really was coming to open the door to him only she was so very long about it. First she chased away her cat lest it should run away when the door was opened then he heard her talking to herself and made out that her lamp wanted trimming that she might see better who it was that knocked and then that it lacked fresh oil and she must refill it. So what with one thing and another she was an immense time trotting to and fro and all the while she now and again bade the Prince have patience. When at last he stood within the little hut he saw with despair that it was a picture of poverty and that not a crumb of anything eatable was to be seen and when he explained to the old woman that he was dying of hunger and fatigue she only answered tranquilly that he must have patience. However she presently showed him a bundle of straw on which he could sleep.But what can I have to eat cried Prince Vivien sharply.Wait a little wait a little she replied. If you will only have patience I am just going out into the garden to gather some peas we will shell them at our leisure then I will light a fire and cook them and when they are thoroughly done we can enjoy them peaceably there is no hurry.I shall have died of starvation by the time all that is done said the Prince ruefully.Patience patience said the old woman looking at him with her slow gentle smile I cant be hurried. All things come at last to him who waits you must have heard that often.Prince Vivien was wild with aggravation but there was nothing to be done.Come then said the old woman you shall hold the lamp to light me while I pick the peas.The Prince in his haste snatched it up so quickly that it went out and it took him a long time to light it again with two little bits of glowing charcoal which he had to dig out from the pile of ashes upon the hearth. However at last the peas were gathered and shelled and the fire lighted but then they had to be carefully counted since the old woman declared that she would cook fifty four and no more. In vain did the Prince represent to her that he was famishedthat fiftyfour peas would go no way towards satisfying his hungerthat a few peas more or less surely could not matter. It was quite useless in the end he had to count out the fiftyfour and worse than that because he dropped one or two in his hurry he had to begin again from the very first to be sure the number was complete. As soon as they were cooked the old dame took a pair of scales and a morsel of bread from the cupboard and was just about to divide it when Prince Vivien who really could wait no longer seized the whole piece and ate it up saying in his turn Patience.You mean that for a joke said the old woman as gently as ever but that is really my name and some day you will know more about me.Then they each ate their twentyseven peas and the Prince was surprised to find that he wanted nothing more and he slept as sweetly upon his bed of straw as he had ever done in his palace.In the morning the old woman gave him milk and bread for his breakfast which he ate contentedly rejoicing that there was nothing to be gathered or counted or cooked and when he had finished he begged her to tell him who she was.That I will with pleasure she replied. But it will be a long story.Oh if its long I cant listen cried the Prince.But said she at your age you should attend to what old people say and learn to have patience.But but said the Prince in his most impatient tone old people should not be so longwinded Tell me what country I have got into and nothing else.With all my heart said she. You are in the Forest of the Black Bird it is here that he utters his oracles.An Oracle cried the Prince. Oh I must go and consult him. Thereupon he drew a handful of gold from his pocket and offered it to the old woman and when she would not take it he threw it down upon the table and was off like a flash of lightning without even staying to ask the way. He took the first path that presented itself and followed it at the top of his speed often losing his way or stumbling over some stone or running up against a tree and leaving behind him without regret the cottage which had been as little to his taste as the character of its possessor. After some time he saw in the distance a huge black castle which commanded a view of the whole forest. The Prince felt certain that this must be the abode of the Oracle and just as the sun was setting he reached its outermost gates. The whole castle was surrounded by a deep moat and the drawbridge and the gates and even the water in the moat were all of the same sombre hue as the walls and towers. Upon the gate hung a huge bell upon which was written in red lettersMortal if thou art curious to know thy fate strike this bell and submit to what shall befall thee.The Prince without the smallest hesitation snatched up a great stone and hammered vigorously upon the bell which gave forth a deep and terrible sound the gate flew open and closed again with a thundering clang the moment the Prince had passed through it while from every tower and battlement rose a wheeling screaming crowd of bats which darkened the whole sky with their multitudes. Anyone but Prince Vivien would have been terrified by such an uncanny sight but he strode stoutly forward till he reached the second gate which was opened to him by sixty black slaves covered from head to foot in long mantles.He wished to speak to them but soon discovered that they spoke an utterly unknown language and did not seem to understand a word he said. This was a great aggravation to the Prince who vas not accustomed to keep his ideas to himself and he positively found himself wishing for his old friend Patience. However he had to follow his guides in silence and they led him into a magnificent hall the floor was of ebony the walls of jet and all the hangings were of black velvet but the Prince looked round it in vain for something to eat and then made signs that he was hungry. In the same manner he was respectfully given to understand that he must wait and after several hours the sixty hooded and shrouded figures reappeared and conducted him with great ceremony and also very very slowly to a banqueting hall where they all placed themselves at a long table. The dishes were arranged down the centre of it and with his usual impetuosity the Prince seized the one that stood in front of him to draw it nearer but soon found that it was firmly fixed in its place. Then he looked at his solemn and lugubrious neighbours and saw that each one was supplied with a long hollow reed through which he slowly sucked up his portion and the Prince was obliged to do the same though he found it a frightfully tedious process. After supper they returned as they had come to the ebony room where he was compelled to look on while his companions played interminable games of chess and not until he was nearly dying of weariness did they slowly and ceremoniously as before conduct him to his sleeping apartment. The hope of consulting the Oracle woke him very early the next morning and his first demand was to be allowed to present himself before it but without replying his attendants conducted him to a huge marble bath very shallow at one end and quite deep at the other and gave him to understand that he was to go into it. The Prince nothing loth was for springing at once into deep water but he was gently but forcibly held back and only allowed to stand where it was about an inch deep and he was nearly wild with impatience when he found that this process was to be repeated every day in spite of all he could say or do the water rising higher and higher by inches so that for sixty days he had to live in perpetual silence ceremoniously conducted to and fro supping all his meals through the long reed and looking on at innumerable games of chess the game of all others which he detested most. But at last the water rose as high as his chin and his bath was complete. And that day the slaves in their black robes and each having a large bat perched upon his head marched in slow procession with the Prince in their midst chanting a melancholy song to the iron gate that led into a kind of Temple. At the sound of their chanting another band of slaves appeared and took possession of the unhappy Vivien.They looked to him exactly like the ones he had left except that they moved more slowly still and each one held a raven upon his wrist and their harsh croakings reechoed through the dismal place. Holding the Prince by the arms not so much to do him honour as to restrain his impatience they proceeded by slow degrees up the steps of the Temple and when they at last reached the top he thought his long waiting must be at an end. But on the contrary after slowly enshrouding him in a long black robe like their own they led him into the Temple itself where he was forced to witness numbers of lengthy rites and ceremonies. By this time Viviens active impatience had subsided into passive weariness his yawns were continual and scandalous but nobody heeded him he stared hopelessly at the thick black curtain which hung down straight in front of him and could hardly believe his eyes when it presently began to slide back and he saw before him the Black Bird. It was of enormous size and was perched upon a thick bar of iron which ran across from one side of the Temple to the other. At the sight of it all the slaves fell upon their knees and hid their faces and when it had three times flapped its mighty wings it uttered distinctly in Prince Viviens own language the wordsPrince your only chance of happiness depends upon that which is most opposed to your own nature.Then the curtain fell before it once more and the Prince after many ceremonies was presented with a raven which perched upon his wrist and was conducted slowly back to the iron gate. Here the raven left him and he was handed over once more to the care of the first band of slaves while a large bat flickered down and settled upon his head of its own accord and so he was taken back to the marble bath and had to go through the whole process again only this time he began in deep water which receded daily inch by inch. When this was over the slaves escorted him to the outer gate and took leave of him with every mark of esteem and politeness to which it is to be feared he responded but indifferently since the gate was no sooner opened than he took to his heels and fled away with all his might his one idea being to put as much space as possible between himself and the dreary place into which he had ventured so rashly just to consult a tedious Oracle who after all had told him nothing. He actually reflected for about five seconds on his folly and came to the conclusion that it might sometimes be advisable to think before one acted.After wandering about for several days until he was weary and hungry he at last succeeded in finding a way out of the forest and soon came to a wide and rapid river which he followed hoping to find some means of crossing it and it happened that as the sun rose the next morning he saw something of a dazzling whiteness moored out in the middle of the stream. Upon looking more attentively at it he found that it was one of the prettiest little ships he had ever seen and the boat that belonged to it was made fast to the bank quite close to him. The Prince was immediately seized with the most ardent desire to go on board the ship and shouted loudly to attract the notice of her crew but no one answered. So he sprang into the little boat and rowed away without finding it at all hard work for the boat was made all of white paper and was as light as a rose leaf. The ship was made of white paper too as the Prince presently discovered when he reached it. He found not a soul on board but there was a very cosy little bed in the cabin and an ample supply of all sorts of good things to eat and drink which he made up his mind to enjoy until something new happened. Having been thoroughly well brought up at the court of King Gridelin of course he understood the art of navigation but when once he had started the current carried the vessel down at such a pace that before he knew where he was the Prince found himself out at sea and a wind springing up behind him just at this moment soon drove him out of sight of land. By this time he was somewhat alarmed and did his best to put the ship about and get back to the river but wind and tide were too strong for him and he began to think of the number of times from his childhood up that he had been warned not to meddle with water. But it was too late now to do anything but wish vainly that he had stayed on shore and to grow heartily weary of the boat and the sea and everything connected with it. These two things however he did most thoroughly. To put the finishing touch to his misfortunes he presently found himself becalmed in midocean a state of affairs which would be considered trying by the most patient of men so you may imagine how it affected Prince Vivien He even came to wishing himself back at the Castle of the Black Bird for there at least he saw some living beings whereas on board the whitepaper ship he was absolutely alone and could not imagine how he was ever to get away from his wearisome prison. However after a very long time he did see land and his impatience to be on shore was so great that he at once flung himself over the ships side that he might reach it sooner by swimming. But this was quite useless for spring as far as he might from the vessel it was always under his feet again before he reached the water and he had to resign himself to his fate and wait with what patience he could muster until the winds and waves carried the ship into a kind of natural harbour which ran far into the land. After his long imprisonment at sea the Prince was delighted with the sight of the great trees which grew down to the very edge of the water and leaping lightly on shore he speedily lost himself in the thick forest. When he had wandered a long way he stopped to rest beside a clear spring of water but scarcely had he thrown himself down upon the mossy bank when there was a great rustling in the bushes close by and out sprang a pretty little gazelle panting and exhausted which fell at his feet gasping outOh Vivien save meThe Prince in great astonishment leapt to his feet and had just time to draw his sword before he found himself face to face with a large green lion which had been hotly pursuing the poor little gazelle. Prince Vivien attacked it gallantly and a fierce combat ensued which however ended before long in the Princes dealing his adversary a terrific blow which felled him to the earth. As he fell the lion whistled loudly three times with such force that the forest rang again and the sound must have been heard for more than two leagues round after which having apparently nothing more to do in the world he rolled over on his side and died. The Prince without paying any further heed to him or to his whistling returned to the pretty gazelle sayingWell are you satisfied now Since you can talk pray tell me instantly what all this is about and how you happen to know my name.Oh I must rest for a long time before I can talk she replied and beside I very much doubt if you will have leisure to listen for the affair is by no means finished. In fact she continued in the same languid tone you had better look behind you now.The Prince turned sharply round and to his horror saw a huge Giant approaching with mighty strides crying fiercelyWho has made my lion whistle I should like to knowI have replied Prince Vivien boldly but I can answer for it that he will not do it againAt these words the Giant began to howl and lament.Alas my poor Tiny my sweet little pet he cried but at least I can avenge thy death.Thereupon he rushed at the Prince brandishing an immense serpent which was coiled about his wrist. Vivien without losing his coolness aimed a terrific blow at it with his sword but no sooner did he touch the snake than it changed into a Giant and the Giant into a snake with such rapidity that the Prince felt perfectly giddy and this happened at least halfadozen times until at last with a fortunate stroke he cut the serpent in halves and picking up one morsel flung it with all his force at the nose of the Giant who fell insensible on top of the lion and in an instant a thick black cloud rolled up which hid them from view and when it cleared away they had all disappeared.Then the Prince without even waiting to sheathe his sword rushed back to the gazelle cryingNow you have had plenty of time to recover your wits and you have nothing more to fear so tell me who you are and what this horrible Giant with his lion and his serpent have to do with you and for pitys sake be quick about it.I will tell you with pleasure she answered but where is the hurry I want you to come back with me to the Green Castle but I dont want to walk there it is so far and walking is so fatiguing.Let us set out at once then replied the Prince severely or else really I shall have to leave you where you are. Surely a young and active gazelle like you ought to be ashamed of not being able to walk a few steps. The further off this castle is the faster we ought to walk but as you dont appear to enjoy that I will promise that we will go gently and we can talk by the way.It would be better still if you would carry me said she sweetly but as I dont like to see people giving themselves trouble you may carry me and make that snail carry you. So saying she pointed languidly with one tiny foot at what the Prince had taken for a block of stone but now he saw that it was a huge snail.What I ride a snail cried the Prince you are laughing at me and beside we should not get there for a year.Oh well then dont do it replied the gazelle I am quite willing to stay here. The grass is green and the water clear. But if I were you I should take the advice that was given me and ride the snail.So though it did not please him at all the Prince took the gazelle in his arms and mounted upon the back of the snail which glided along very peaceably entirely declining to be hurried by frequent blows from the Princes heels. In vain did the gazelle represent to him that she was enjoying herself very much and that this was the easiest mode of conveyance she had ever discovered. Prince Vivien was wild with impatience and thought that the Green Castle would never be reached. However at last they did get there and everyone who was in it ran to see the Prince dismount from his singular steed.But what was his surprise when having at her request set the gazelle gently down upon the steps which led up to the castle he saw her suddenly change into a charming Princess and recognized in her his pretty cousin Placida who greeted him with her usual tranquil sweetness. His delight knew no bounds and he followed her eagerly up into the castle impatient to know what strange events had brought her there. But after all he had to wait for the Princesss story for the inhabitants of the Green Lands hearing that the Giant was dead ran to offer the kingdom to his vanquisher and Prince Vivien had to listen to various complimentary harangues which took a great deal of time though he cut them as short as politeness allowedif not shorter. But at last he was free to rejoin Placida who at once began the story of her adventures.After you had gone away said she they tried to make me learn how to govern the kingdom which wearied me to death so that I begged and prayed Lolotte to take me away with her and this she presently did but very reluctantly. However having been transported to her grotto upon my favourite couch I spent several delicious days soothed by the soft green light which was like a beech wood in the spring and by the murmuring of bees and the tinkle of falling water. But alas Lolotte was forced to go away to a general assembly of the Fairies and she came back in great dismay telling me that her indulgence to me had cost her dear for she had been severely reprimanded and ordered to hand me over to the Fairy Mirlifiche who was already taking charge of you and who had been much commended for her management of you.Fine management indeed interrupted the Prince if it is to her I owe all the adventures I have met with But go on with your story my cousin. I can tell you all about my doings afterwards and then you can judge for yourself.At first I was grieved to see Lolotte cry resumed the Princess but I soon found that grieving was very troublesome so I thought it better to be calm and very soon afterwards I saw the Fairy Mirlifiche arrive mounted upon her great unicorn. She stopped before the grotto and bade Lolotte bring me out to her at which she cried worse than ever and kissed me a dozen times but she dared not refuse. I was lifted up on to the unicorn behind Mirlifiche who said to meHold on tight little girl if you dont want to break your neck.And indeed I had to hold on with all my might for her horrible steed trotted so violently that it positively took my breath away. However at last we stopped at a large farm and the farmer and his wife ran out as soon as they saw the Fairy and helped us to dismount.I knew that they were really a King and Queen whom the Fairies were punishing for their ignorance and idleness. You may imagine that I was by this time half dead with fatigue but Mirlifiche insisted upon my feeding her unicorn before I did anything else. To accomplish this I had to climb up a long ladder into the hayloft and bring down one after another twentyfour handfuls of hay. Never never before did I have such a wearisome task It makes me shudder to think of it now and that was not all. In the same way I had to carry the twentyfour handfuls of hay to the stable and then it was supper time and I had to wait upon all the others. After that I really thought I should be allowed to go peaceably to my little bed but oh dear no First of all I had to make it for it was all in confusion and then I had to make one for the Fairy and tuck her in and draw the curtains round her beside rendering her a dozen little services which I was not at all accustomed to. Finally when I was perfectly exhausted by all this toil I was free to go to bed myself but as I had never before undressed myself and really did not know how to begin I lay down as I was. Unfortunately the Fairy found this out and just as I was falling into a sweet slumber she made me get up once more but even then I managed to escape her vigilance and only took off my upper robe. Indeed I may tell you in confidence that I always find disobedience answer very well. One is often scolded it is true but then one has been saved some trouble.At the earliest dawn of day Mirlifiche woke me and made me take many journeys to the stable to bring her word how her unicorn had slept and how much hay he had eaten and then to find out what time it was and if it was a fine day. I was so slow and did my errands so badly that before she left she called the King and Queen and said to themI am much more pleased with you this year. Continue to make the best of your farm if you wish to get back to your kingdom and also take care of this little Princess for me and teach her to be useful that when I come I may find her cured of her faults. If she is notHere she broke off with a significant look and mounting my enemy the unicorn speedily disappeared.Then the King and Queen turning to me asked me what I could do.Nothing at all I assure you I replied in a tone which really ought to have convinced them but they went on to describe various employments and tried to discover which of them would be most to my taste. However at last I persuaded them that to do nothing whatever would be the only thing that would suit me and that if they really wanted to be kind to me they would let me go to bed and to sleep and not tease me about doing anything. To my great joy they not only permitted this but actually when they had their own meals the Queen brought my portion up to me. But early the next morning she appeared at my bedside saying with an apologetic airMy pretty child I am afraid you must really make up your mind to get up today. I know quite well how delightful it is to be thoroughly idle for when my husband and I were King and Queen we did nothing at all from morning to night and I sincerely hope that it will not be long before those happy days will come again for us. But at present we have not reached them nor have you and you know from what the Fairy said that perhaps worse things may happen to us if she is not obeyed. Make haste I beg of you and come down to breakfast for I have put by some delicious cream for you.It was really very tiresome but as there was no help for it I went downBut the instant breakfast was over they began again their cuckoo cry of What will you do In vain did I answerNothing at all if it please you madam.The Queen at last gave me a spindle and about four pounds of hemp upon a distaff and sent me out to keep the sheep assuring me that there could not be a pleasanter occupation and that I could take my ease as much as I pleased. I was forced to set out very unwillingly as you may imagine but I had not walked far before I came to a shady bank in what seemed to me a charming place. I stretched myself cosily upon the soft grass and with the bundle of hemp for a pillow slept as tranquilly as if there were no such things as sheep in the world while they for their part wandered hither and thither at their own sweet will as if there were no such thing as a shepherdess invading every field and browsing upon every kind of forbidden dainty until the peasants alarmed by the havoc they were making raised a clamour which at last reached the ears of the King and Queen who ran out and seeing the cause of the commotion hastily collected their flock. And indeed the sooner the better since they had to pay for all the damage they had done. As for me I lay still and watched them run for I was very comfortable and there I might be still if they had not come up all panting and breathless and compelled me to get up and follow them they also reproached me bitterly but I need hardly tell you that they did not again entrust me with the flock.But whatever they found for me to do it was always the same thing I spoilt and mismanaged it all and was so successful in provoking even the most patient people that one day I ran away from the farm for I was really afraid the Queen would be obliged to beat me. When I came to the little river in which the King used to fish I found the boat tied to a tree and stepping in I unfastened it and floated gently down with the current. The gliding of the boat was so soothing that I did not trouble myself in the least when the Queen caught sight of me and ran along the bank cryingMy boat my boat Husband come and catch the little Princess who is running away with my boatThe current soon carried me out of hearing of her cries and I dreamed to the song of the ripples and the whisper of the trees until the boat suddenly stopped and I found it was stuck fast beside a fresh green meadow and that the sun was rising. In the distance I saw some little houses which seemed to be built in a most singular fashion but as I was by this time very hungry I set out towards them but before I had walked many steps I saw that the air was full of shining objects which seemed to be fixed and yet I could not see what they hung from.I went nearer and saw a silken cord hanging down to the ground and pulled it just because it was so close to my hand. Instantly the whole meadow resounded to the melodious chiming of a peal of silver bells and they sounded so pretty that I sat down to listen and to watch them as they swung shining in the sunbeams. Before they ceased to sound came a great flight of birds and each one perching upon a bell added its charming song to the concert. As they ended I looked up and saw a tall and stately dame advancing towards me surrounded and followed by a vast flock of every kind of bird.Who are you little girl said she who dares to come where I allow no mortal to live lest my birds should be disturbed Still if you are clever at anything she added I might be able to put up with your presence.Madam I answered rising you may be very sure that I shall not do anything to alarm your birds. I only beg you for pitys sake to give me something to eat.I will do that she replied before I send you where you deserve to go.And thereupon she despatched six jays who were her pages to fetch me all sorts of biscuits while some of the other birds brought ripe fruits. In fact I had a delicious breakfast though I do not like to be waited upon so quickly. It is so disagreeable to be hurried. I began to think I should like very well to stay in this pleasant country and I said so to the stately lady but she answered with the greatest disdainDo you think I would keep you here You Why what do you suppose would be the good of you in this country where everybody is wideawake and busy No no I have shown you all the hospitality you will get from me.With these words she turned and gave a vigorous pull to the silken rope which I mentioned before but instead of a melodious chime there arose a hideous clanging which quite terrified me and in an instant a huge Black Bird appeared which alighted at the Fairys feet saying in a frightful voiceWhat do you want of me my sisterI wish you to take this little Princess to my cousin the Giant of the Green Castle at once she replied and beg him from me to make her work day and night upon his beautiful tapestry.At these words the great Bird snatched me up regardless of my cries and flew off at a terrific paceOh you are joking cousin interrupted Prince Vivien you mean as slowly as possible. I know that horrible Black Bird and the lengthiness of all his proceedings and surroundings.Have it your own way replied Placida tranquilly. I cannot bear arguing. Perhaps this was not even the same bird. At any rate he carried me off at a prodigious speed and set me gently down in this very castle of which you are now the master. We entered by one of the windows and when the Bird had handed me over to the Giant from whom you have been good enough to deliver me and given the Fairys message it departed.Then the Giant turned to me sayingSo you are an idler Ah well we must teach you to work. You wont be the first we have cured of laziness. See how busy all my guests are.I looked up as he spoke and saw that an immense gallery ran all round the hall in which were tapestry frames spindles skeins of wool patterns and all necessary things. Before each frame about a dozen people were sitting hard at work at which terrible sight I fainted away and as soon as I recovered they began to ask me what I could do.It was in vain that I replied as before and with the strongest desire to be taken at my word Nothing at all.The Giant only saidThen you must learn to do something in this world there is enough work for everybody.It appeared that they were working into the tapestry all the stories the Fairies liked best and they began to try and teach me to help them but from the first class where they tried me to begin with I sank lower and lower and not even the most simple stitches could I learn.In vain they punished me by all the usual methods. In vain the Giant showed me his menagerie which was entirely composed of children who would not work Nothing did me any good and at last I was reduced to drawing water for the dyeing of the wools and even over that I was so slow that this morning the Giant flew into a rage and changed me into a gazelle. He was just putting me into the menagerie when I happened to catch sight of a dog and was seized with such terror that I fled away at my utmost speed and escaped through the outer court of the castle. The Giant fearing that I should be lost altogether sent his green lion after me with orders to bring me back cost what it might and I should certainly have let myself be caught or eaten up or anything rather than run any further if I had not luckily met you by the fountain. And oh concluded the Princess how delightful it is once more to be able to sit still in peace. I was so tired of trying to learn things.Prince Vivien said that for his part he had been kept a great deal too still and had not found it at all amusing and then he recounted all his adventures with breathless rapidity. How he had taken shelter with Dame Patience and consulted the Oracle and voyaged in the paper ship. Then they went hand in hand to release all the prisoners in the castle and all the Princes and Princesses who were in cages in the menagerie for the instant the Green Giant was dead they had resumed their natural forms. As you may imagine they were all very grateful and Princess Placida entreated them never never to do another stitch of work so long as they lived and they promptly made a great bonfire in the courtyard and solemnly burnt all the embroidery frames and spinning wheels. Then the Princess gave them splendid presents or rather sat by while Prince Vivien gave them and there were great rejoicings in the Green Castle and everyone did his best to please the Prince and Princess. But with all their good intentions they often made mistakes for Vivien and Placida were never of one mind about their plans so it was very confusing and they frequently found themselves obeying the Princes orders very very slowly and rushing off with lightning speed to do something that the Princess did not wish to have done at all until byandby the two cousins took to consulting with and consoling one another in all these little vexations and at last came to be so fond of each other that for Placidas sake Vivien became quite patient and for Viviens sake Placida made the most unheardof exertions. But now the Fairies who had been watching all these proceedings with interest thought it was time to interfere and ascertain by further trials if this improvement was likely to continue and if they really loved one another. So they caused Placida to seem to have a violent fever and Vivien to languish and grow dull and made each of them very uneasy about the other and then finding a moment when they were apart the Fairy Mirlifiche suddenly appeared to Placida and saidI have just seen Prince Vivien and he seemed to me to be very ill.Alas yes madam she answered and if you will but cure him you may take me back to the farm or bring the Green Giant to life again and you shall see how obedient I will be.If you really wish him to recover said the Fairy you have only to catch the Trotting Mouse and the ChaffinchontheWing and bring them to me. Only remember that time pressesShe had hardly finished speaking before the Princess was rushing headlong out of the castle gate and the Fairy after watching her till she was lost to sight gave a little chuckle and went in search of the Prince who begged her earnestly to send him back to the Black Castle or to the paper boat if she would but save Placidas life. The Fairy shook her head and looked very grave. She quite agreed with him the Princess was in a bad wayBut said she if you can find the Rosy Mole and give him to her she will recover. So now it was the Princes turn to set off in a vast hurry only as soon as he left the Castle he happened to go in exactly the opposite direction to the one Placida had taken. Now you can imagine these two devoted lovers hunting night and day. The Princess in the woods always running always listening pursuing hotly after two creatures which seemed to her very hard to catch which she yet never ceased from pursuing. The Prince on the other hand wandering continually across the meadows his eyes fixed upon the ground attentive to every movement among the moles. He was forced to walk slowlyslowly upon tiptoe hardly venturing to breathe. Often he stood for hours motionless as a statue and if the desire to succeed could have helped him he would soon have possessed the Rosy Mole. But alas all that he caught were black and ordinary though strange to say he never grew impatient but always seemed ready to begin the tedious hunt again. But this changing of character is one of the most ordinary miracles which love works. Neither the Prince nor the Princess gave a thought to anything but their quest. It never even occurred to them to wonder what country they had reached. So you may guess how astonished they were one day when having at last been successful after their long and weary chase they cried aloud at the same instant At last I have saved my beloved and then recognising each others voice looked up and rushed to meet one another with the wildest joy. Surprise kept them silent while for one delicious moment they gazed into each others eyes and just then who should come up but King Gridelin for it was into his kingdom they had accidentally strayed. He recognized them in his turn and greeted them joyfully but when they turned afterwards to look for the Rosy Mole the Chaffinch and the TrottingMouse they had vanished and in their places stood a lovely lady whom they did not know the Black Bird and the Green Giant. King Gridelin had no sooner set eyes upon the lady than with a cry of joy he clasped her in his arms for it was no other than his long lost wife Santorina about whose imprisonment in Fairyland you may perhaps read some day.Then the Black Bird and the Green Giant resumed their natural form for they were enchanters and up flew Lolotte and Mirlifiche in their chariots and then there was a great kissing and congratulating for everybody had regained someone he loved including the enchanters who loved their natural forms dearly. After this they repaired to the Palace and the wedding of Prince Vivien and Princess Placida was held at once with all the splendour imaginable.King Gridelin and Queen Santorina after all their experiences had no further desire to reign so they retired happily to a peaceful place leaving their kingdom to the Prince and Princess who were beloved by all their subjects and found their greatest happiness all their lives long in making other people happy.
Two little Frogs were playing about at the edge of a pool when an Ox came down to the water to drink and by accident trod on one of them and crushed the life out of him. When the old Frog missed him she asked his brother where he was. He is dead mother said the little Frog an enormous big creature with four legs came to our pool this morning and trampled him down in the mud. Enormous was he Was he as big as this said the Frog puffing herself out to look as big as possible. Oh yes much bigger was the answer.The Frog puffed herself out still more. Was he as big as this said she. Oh yes yes mother MUCHbigger said the little Frog.And yet again she puffed and puffed herself out till she was almost as round as a ball. As big as she beganbut then she burst.
In China as you know the Emperor is a Chinaman and all the people around him are Chinamen too. It is many years since the story I am going to tell you happened but that is all the more reason for telling it lest it should be forgotten. The emperors palace was the most beautiful thing in the world it was made entirely of the finest porcelain very costly but at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched with the very greatest care. There were the most extraordinary flowers to be seen in the garden the most beautiful ones had little silver bells tied to them which tinkled perpetually so that one should not pass the flowers without looking at them. Every little detail in the garden had been most carefully thought out and it was so big that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended. If one went on walking one came to beautiful woods with lofty trees and deep lakes. The wood extended to the sea which was deep and blue deep enough for large ships to sail up right under the branches of the trees. Among these trees lived a nightingale which sang so deliciously that even the poor fisherman who had plenty of other things to do lay still to listen to it when he was out at night drawing in his nets. Heavens how beautiful it is he said but then he had to attend to his business and forgot it. The next night when he heard it again he would again exclaim Heavens how beautiful it isTravellers came to the emperors capital from every country in the world they admired everything very much especially the palace and the gardens but when they heard the nightingale they all said This is better than anythingWhen they got home they described it and the learned ones wrote many books about the town the palace and the garden but nobody forgot the nightingale it was always put above everything else. Those among them who were poets wrote the most beautiful poems all about the nightingale in the woods by the deep blue sea. These books went all over the world and in course of time some of them reached the emperor. He sat in his golden chair reading and reading and nodding his head well pleased to hear such beautiful descriptions of the town the palace and the garden. But the nightingale is the best of all he read.What is this said the emperor. The nightingale Why I know nothing about it. Is there such a bird in my kingdom and in my own garden into the bargain and I have never heard of it Imagine my having to discover this from a bookThen he called his gentlemaninwaiting who was so grand that when any one of a lower rank dared to speak to him or to ask him a question he would only answer P which means nothing at all.There is said to be a very wonderful bird called a nightingale here said the emperor. They say that it is better than anything else in all my great kingdom Why have I never been told anything about itI have never heard it mentioned said the gentlemaninwaiting. It has never been presented at court.I wish it to appear here this evening to sing to me said the emperor. The whole world knows what I am possessed of and I know nothing about itI have never heard it mentioned before said the gentlemaninwaiting. I will seek it and I will find it But where was it to be found The gentlemaninwaiting ran upstairs and downstairs and in and out of all the rooms and corridors. No one of all those he met had ever heard anything about the nightingale so the gentlemaninwaiting ran back to the emperor and said that it must be a myth invented by the writers of the books. Your imperial majesty must not believe everything that is written books are often mere inventions even if they do not belong to what we call the black artBut the book in which I read it is sent to me by the powerful Emperor of Japan so it cant be untrue. I will hear this nightingale I insist upon its being here tonight. I extend my most gracious protection to it and if it is not forthcoming I will have the whole court trampled upon after supperTsingpe said the gentlemaninwaiting and away he ran again up and down all the stairs in and out of all the rooms and corridors half the court ran with him for they none of them wished to be trampled on. There was much questioning about this nightingale which was known to all the outside world but to no one at court. At last they found a poor little maid in the kitchen. She said Oh heavens the nightingale I know it very well. Yes indeed it can sing. Every evening I am allowed to take broken meat to my poor sick mother she lives down by the shore. On my way back when I am tired I rest awhile in the wood and then I hear the nightingale. Its song brings the tears into my eyes I feel as if my mother were kissing meLittle kitchenmaid said the gentlemaninwaiting I will procure you a permanent position in the kitchen and permission to see the emperor dining if you will take us to the nightingale. It is commanded to appear at court tonight.Then they all went out into the wood where the nightingale usually sang. Half the court was there. As they were going along at their best pace a cow began to bellow.Oh said a young courtier there we have it. What wonderful power for such a little creature I have certainly heard it before.No those are the cows bellowing we are a long way yet from the place. Then the frogs began to croak in the marsh.Beautiful said the Chinese chaplain it is just like the tinkling of church bells.No those are the frogs said the little kitchenmaid. But I think we shall soon hear it nowThen the nightingale began to sing.There it is said the little girl. Listen listen there it sits and she pointed to a little grey bird up among the branches.Is it possible said the gentlemaninwaiting. I should never have thought it was like that. How common it looks Seeing so many grand people must have frightened all its colours away.Little nightingale called the kitchenmaid quite loud our gracious emperor wishes you to sing to himWith the greatest of pleasure said the nightingale warbling away in the most delightful fashion.It is just like crystal bells said the gentlemaninwaiting. Look at its little throat how active it is. It is extraordinary that we have never heard it before I am sure it will be a great success at courtShall I sing again to the emperor said the nightingale who thought he was present.My precious little nightingale said the gentlemaninwaiting I have the honour to command your attendance at a court festival tonight where you will charm his gracious majesty the emperor with your fascinating singing.It sounds best among the trees said the nightingale but it went with them willingly when it heard that the emperor wished it.The palace had been brightened up for the occasion. The walls and the floors which were all of china shone by the light of many thousand golden lamps. The most beautiful flowers all of the tinkling kind were arranged in the corridors there was hurrying to and fro and a great draught but this was just what made the bells ring ones ears were full of the tinkling. In the middle of the large receptionroom where the emperor sat a golden rod had been fixed on which the nightingale was to perch. The whole court was assembled and the little kitchenmaid had been permitted to stand behind the door as she now had the actual title of cook. They were all dressed in their best everybodys eyes were turned towards the little grey bird at which the emperor was nodding. The nightingale sang delightfully and the tears came into the emperors eyes nay they rolled down his cheeks and then the nightingale sang more beautifully than ever its notes touched all hearts. The emperor was charmed and said the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round its neck. But the nightingale declined with thanks it had already been sufficiently rewarded.I have seen tears in the eyes of the emperor that is my richest reward. The tears of an emperor have a wonderful power God knows I am sufficiently recompensed and then it again burst into its sweet heavenly song.That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen said the ladies and they took some water into their mouths to try and make the same gurgling when any one spoke to them thinking so to equal the nightingale. Even the lackeys and the chambermaids announced that they were satisfied and that is saying a great deal they are always the most difficult people to please. Yes indeed the nightingale had made a sensation. It was to stay at court now and to have its own cage as well as liberty to walk out twice a day and once in the night. It always had twelve footmen with each one holding a ribbon which was tied round its leg. There was not much pleasure in an outing of that sort.The whole town talked about the marvellous bird and if two people met one said to the other Night and the other answered Gale and then they sighed perfectly understanding each other. Eleven cheesemongers children were called after it but they had not got a voice among them.One day a large parcel came for the emperor outside was written the word Nightingale.Here we have another new book about this celebrated bird said the emperor. But it was no book it was a little work of art in a box an artificial nightingale exactly like the living one but it was studded all over with diamonds rubies and sapphires.When the bird was wound up it could sing one of the songs the real one sang and it wagged its tail which glittered with silver and gold. A ribbon was tied round its neck on which was written The Emperor of Japans nightingale is very poor compared to the Emperor of Chinas.Everybody said Oh how beautiful And the person who brought the artificial bird immediately received the title of Imperial NightingaleCarrier in Chief.Now they must sing together what a duet that will be.Then they had to sing together but they did not get on very well for the real nightingale sang in its own way and the artificial one could only sing waltzes.There is no fault in that said the musicmaster it is perfectly in time and correct in every wayThen the artificial bird had to sing alone. It was just as great a success as the real one and then it was so much prettier to look at it glittered like bracelets and breastpins.It sang the same tune three and thirty times over and yet it was not tired people would willingly have heard it from the beginning again but the emperor said that the real one must have a turn nowbut where was it No one had noticed that it had flown out of the open window back to its own green woods.But what is the meaning of this said the emperor.All the courtiers railed at it and said it was a most ungrateful bird.We have got the best bird though said they and then the artificial bird had to sing again and this was the thirtyfourth time that they heard the same tune but they did not know it thoroughly even yet because it was so difficult.The musicmaster praised the bird tremendously and insisted that it was much better than the real nightingale not only as regarded the outside with all the diamonds but the inside too.Because you see my ladies and gentlemen and the emperor before all in the real nightingale you never know what you will hear but in the artificial one everything is decided beforehand So it is and so it must remain it cant be otherwise. You can account for things you can open it and show the human ingenuity in arranging the waltzes how they go and how one note follows upon anotherThose are exactly my opinions they all said and the musicmaster got leave to show the bird to the public next Sunday. They were also to hear it sing said the emperor. So they heard it and all became as enthusiastic over it as if they had drunk themselves merry on tea because that is a thoroughly Chinese habit.Then they all said Oh and stuck their forefingers in the air and nodded their heads but the poor fishermen who had heard the real nightingale said It sounds very nice and it is very like the real one but there is something wanting we dont know what. The real nightingale was banished from the kingdom.The artificial bird had its place on a silken cushion close to the emperors bed all the presents it had received of gold and precious jewels were scattered round it. Its title had risen to be Chief Imperial Singer of the BedChamber in rank number one on the left side for the emperor reckoned that side the important one where the heart was seated. And even an emperors heart is on the left side. The musicmaster wrote fiveandtwenty volumes about the artificial bird the treatise was very long and written in all the most difficult Chinese characters. Everybody said they had read and understood it for otherwise they would have been reckoned stupid and then their bodies would have been trampled upon.Things went on in this way for a whole year. The emperor the court and all the other Chinamen knew every little gurgle in the song of the artificial bird by heart but they liked it all the better for this and they could all join in the song themselves. Even the street boys sang zizizi and cluck cluck cluck and the emperor sang it too.But one evening when the bird was singing its best and the emperor was lying in bed listening to it something gave way inside the bird with a whizz. Then a spring burst whirr went all the wheels and the music stopped. The emperor jumped out of bed and sent for his private physicians but what good could they do Then they sent for the watchmaker and after a good deal of talk and examination he got the works to go again somehow but he said it would have to be saved as much as possible because it was so worn out and he could not renew the works so as to be sure of the tune. This was a great blow They only dared to let the artificial bird sing once a year and hardly that but then the musicmaster made a little speech using all the most difficult words. He said it was just as good as ever and his saying it made it so.Five years now passed and then a great grief came upon the nation for they were all very fond of their emperor and he was ill and could not live it was said. A new emperor was already chosen and people stood about in the street and asked the gentlemaninwaiting how their emperor was going on.P answered he shaking his head.The emperor lay pale and cold in his gorgeous bed the courtiers thought he was dead and they all went off to pay their respects to their new emperor. The lackeys ran off to talk matters over and the chambermaids gave a great coffeeparty. Cloth had been laid down in all the rooms and corridors so as to deaden the sound of footsteps so it was very very quiet. But the emperor was not dead yet. He lay stiff and pale in the gorgeous bed with its velvet hangings and heavy golden tassels. There was an open window high above him and the moon streamed in upon the emperor and the artificial bird beside him.The poor emperor could hardly breathe he seemed to have a weight on his chest he opened his eyes and then he saw that it was Death sitting upon his chest wearing his golden crown. In one hand he held the emperors golden sword and in the other his imperial banner. Round about from among the folds of the velvet hangings peered many curious faces some were hideous others gentle and pleasant. They were all the emperors good and bad deeds which now looked him in the face when Death was weighing him down.Do you remember that whispered one after the other Do you remember this and they told him so many things that the perspiration poured down his face.I never knew that said the emperor. Music music sound the great Chinese drums he cried that I may not hear what they are saying. But they went on and on and Death sat nodding his head just like a Chinaman at everything that was said.Music music shrieked the emperor. You precious little golden bird sing sing I have loaded you with precious stones and even hung my own golden slipper round your neck sing I tell you singBut the bird stood silent there was nobody to wind it up so of course it could not go. Death continued to fix the great empty sockets of his eyes upon him and all was silent so terribly silent.Suddenly close to the window there was a burst of lovely song it was the living nightingale perched on a branch outside. It had heard of the emperors need and had come to bring comfort and hope to him. As it sang the faces round became fainter and fainter and the blood coursed with fresh vigour in the emperors veins and through his feeble limbs. Even Death himself listened to the song and said Go on little nightingale go onYes if you give me the gorgeous golden sword yes if you give me the imperial banner yes if you give me the emperors crown.And Death gave back each of these treasures for a song and the nightingale went on singing. It sang about the quiet churchyard when the roses bloom where the elder flower scents the air and where the fresh grass is ever moistened anew by the tears of the mourner. This song brought to Death a longing for his own garden and like a cold grey mist he passed out of the window.Thanks thanks said the emperor you heavenly little bird I know you I banished you from my kingdom and yet you have charmed the evil visions away from my bed by your song and even Death away from my heart How can I ever repay youYou have rewarded me said the nightingale. I brought the tears to your eyes the very first time I ever sang to you and I shall never forget it Those are the jewels which gladden the heart of a singerbut sleep now and wake up fresh and strong I will sing to youThen it sang again and the emperor fell into a sweet refreshing sleep. The sun shone in at his window when he woke refreshed and well none of his attendants had yet come back to him for they thought he was dead but the nightingale still sat there singing.You must always stay with me said the emperor. You shall only sing when you like and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand piecesDont do that said the nightingale it did all the good it could keep it as you have always done I cant build my nest and live in this palace but let me come whenever I like then I will sit on the branch in the evening and sing to you. I will sing to cheer you and to make you thoughtful too I will sing to you of the happy ones and of those that suffer too. I will sing about the good and the evil which are kept hidden from you. The little singing bird flies far and wide to the poor fisherman and the peasants home to numbers who are far from you and your court. I love your heart more than your crown and yet there is an odour of sanctity round the crown tooI will come and I will sing to youBut you must promise me one thingEverything said the emperor who stood there in his imperial robes which he had just put on and he held the sword heavy with gold upon his heart.One thing I ask you Tell no one that you have a little bird who tells you everything it will be better soThen the nightingale flew away. The attendants came in to see after their dead emperor and there he stood bidding them Good morning
A lightbraind tortoise ancientlyTired of her hole the world would see.Prone are all such selfbanishd to roamProne are all cripples to abhor their home.Two ducks to whom the gossip toldThe secret of her purpose boldProfessd to have the means wherebyThey could her wishes gratify.Our boundless road said they beholdIt is the open airAnd through it we will bearYou safe oer land and ocean.Republics kingdoms you will viewAnd famous cities old and newAnd get of customs laws a notionOf various wisdom various piecesAs did indeed the sage Ulysses.The eager tortoise waited notTo question what Ulysses gotBut closed the bargain on the spot.A nice machine the birds deviseTo bear their pilgrim through the skies.Athwart her mouth a stick they throwNow bite it hard and dont let goThey say and seize each duck an endAnd swiftly flying upward tend.It made the people gape and stareBeyond the expressive power of wordsTo see a tortoise cut the airExactly poised between two birds.A miracle they cried is seenThere goes the flying tortoise queenThe queen twas thus the tortoise spokeIm truly that without a joke.Much better had she held her tongueFor opening that whereby she clungBefore the gazing crowd she fellAnd dashd to bits her brittle shell.Imprudence vanity and babbleAnd idle curiosityAn everundivided rabbleHave all the same paternity.
The boggy portion of North Kingston Rhode Island known as Swamptown is of queer repute in its neighborhood for Hell Hollow Pork Hill Indian Corner and Kettle Hole have their stories of Indian crimes and witchmeetings. Here the headless figure of a negro boy was seen by a belated traveller on a path that leads over the hills. It was a dark night and the figure was revealed in a blaze of blue light. It swayed to and fro for a time then rose from the ground with a lurch and shot into space leaving a trail of illumination behind it. Here too is GooseNest Spring where the witches dance at night. It dries up every winter and flows through the summer gushing forth on the same day of every year except once when a goose took possession of the empty bed and hatched her brood there. That time the water did not flow until she got away with her progeny.But the most grewsome story of the place is that of the Indian whose skull was found by a roadmender. This unsuspecting person took it home and as the women would not allow him to carry it into the house he hung it on a pole outside. Just as the people were starting for bed there came a rattling at the door and looking out of the windows they saw a skeleton stalking around in quick and angry strides like those of a person looking for something. But how could that be when the skeleton had neither eyes nor a place to carry them It thrashed its bony arms impatiently and its ribs rattled like a xylophone. The spectators were transfixed with fear all except the culprit who said through the window in a matteroffact way I left your head on the pole at the back door. The skeleton started in that direction seized the skull clapped it into the place where a head should have grown on its own shoulders and after shaking its fists in a threatening way at the house disappeared in the darkness. It is said that he acts as a kind of guard in the neighborhood to see that none of the other Indians buried there shall be disturbed as he was. His principal lounging place is Indian Corner where there is a rock from which blood flows when the moon shinesa memento doubtless of some tragedy that occurred there in times before the white men knew the place. There is iron in the soil and visitors say that the red color is due to that and that the spring would flow just as freely on dark nights as on bright ones if any were there to see it but the natives who have given some thought to these matters know better.
A long time ago there lived a king and queen who had no children although they both wished very much for a little son. They tried not to let each other see how unhappy they were and pretended to take pleasure in hunting and hawking and all sorts of other sports but at length the king could bear it no longer and declared that he must go and visit the furthest corners of his kingdom and that it would be many months before he should return to his capital.By that time he hoped he would have so many things to think about that he would have forgotten to trouble about the little son who never came.The country the king reigned over was very large and full of high stony mountains and sandy deserts so that it was not at all easy to go from one place to another. One day the king had wandered out alone meaning to go only a little distance but everything looked so alike he could not make out the path by which he had come. He walked on and on for hours the sun beating hotly on his head and his legs trembling under him and he might have died of thirst if he had not suddenly stumbled on a little well which looked as if it had been newly dug. On the surface floated a silver cup with a golden handle but as it bobbed about whenever the king tried to seize it he was too thirsty to wait any longer and knelt down and drank his fill.When he had finished he began to rise from his knees but somehow his beard seemed to have stuck fast in the water and with all his efforts he could not pull it out. After two or three jerks to his head which only hurt him without doing any good he called out angrily Let go at once Who is holding meIt is I the King Kostiei said a voice from the well and looking up through the water was a little man with green eyes and a big head. You have drunk from my spring and I shall not let you go until you promise to give me the most precious thing your palace contains which was not there when you left it.Now the only thing that the king much cared for in his palace was the queen herself and as she was weeping bitterly on a pile of cushions in the great hall when he had ridden away he knew that Kostieis words could not apply to her. So he cheerfully gave the promise asked for by the ugly little man and in the twinkling of an eye man spring and cup had disappeared and the king was left kneeling on the dry sand wondering if it was all a dream. But as he felt much stronger and better he made up his mind that this strange adventure must really have happened and he sprang on his horse and rode off with a light heart to look for his companions.In a few weeks they began to set out on their return home which they reached one hot day eight months after they had all left. The king was greatly beloved by his people and crowds lined the roads shouting and waving their hats as the procession passed along. On the steps of the palace stood the queen with a splendid golden cushion in her arms and on the cushion the most beautiful boy that ever was seen wrapped about in a cloud of lace. In a moment Kostieis words rushed into the kings mind and he began to weep bitterly to the surprise of everybody who had expected him nearly to die of joy at the sight of his son. But try as he would and work as hard as he might he could never forget his promise and every time he let the baby out of his sight he thought that he had seen it for the last time.However years passed on and the prince grew first into a big boy and then into a fine young man. Kostiei made no sign and gradually even the anxious king thought less and less about him and in the end forgot him altogether.There was no family in the whole kingdom happier than the king and queen and prince until one day when the youth met a little old man as he was hunting in a lonely part of the woods. How are you my unlookedfor Prince he said. You kept them waiting a good long timeAnd who are you asked the prince.You will know soon enough. When you go home give my compliments to your father and tell him that I wish he would square accounts with me. If he neglects to pay his debts he will bitterly repent it.So saying the old man disappeared and the prince returned to the palace and told his father what had happened.The king turned pale and explained to his son the terrible story.Do not grieve over it father answered the prince. It is nothing so dreadful after all I will find some way to force Kostiei to give up his rights over me. But if I do not come back in a years time you must give up all hopes of ever seeing me.Then the prince began to prepare for his journey. His father gave him a complete suit of steel armour a sword and a horse while his mother hung round his neck a cross of gold. So kissing him tenderly with many tears they let him go.He rode steadily on for three days and at sunset on the fourth day he found himself on the seashore. On the sand before him lay twelve white dresses dazzling as the snow yet as far as his eyes could reach there was no one in sight to whom they could belong. Curious to see what would happen he took up one of the garments and leaving his horse loose to wander about the adjoining fields he hid himself among some willows and waited. In a few minutes a flock of geese which had been paddling about in the sea approached the shore and put on the dresses struck the sand with their feet and were transformed in the twinkling of an eye into eleven beautiful young girls who flew away as fast as they could. The twelfth and youngest remained in the water stretching out her long white neck and looking about her anxiously. Suddenly among the willows she perceived the kings son and called out to him with a human voiceOh Prince give me back my dress and I shall be for ever grateful to you.The prince hastened to lay the dress on the sand and walked away. When the maiden had thrown off the gooseskin and quickly put on her proper clothes she came towards him and he saw that none had ever seen or told of such beauty as hers. She blushed and held out her hand saying to him in a soft voiceI thank you noble Prince for having granted my request. I am the youngest daughter of Kostiei the immortal who has twelve daughters and rules over the kingdoms under the earth. Long time my father has waited for you and great is his anger. But trouble not yourself and fear nothing only do as I bid you. When you see the King Kostiei fall straightway upon your knees and heed neither his threats nor his cry but draw near to him boldly. That which will happen after you will know in time. Now let us go.At these words she struck the ground with her foot and a gulf opened down which they went right into the heart of the earth. In a short time they reached Kostieis palace which gives light with a light brighter than the sun to the dark kingdoms below. And the prince as he had been bidden entered boldly into the hall.Kostiei with a shining crown upon his head sat in the centre upon a golden throne. His green eyes glittered like glass his hands were as the claws of a crab. When he caught sight of the prince he uttered piercing yells which shook the walls of the palace. The prince took no notice but continued his advance on his knees towards the throne. When he had almost reached it the king broke out into a laugh and saidIt has been very lucky for you that you have been able to make me laugh. Stay with us in our underground empire only first you will have to do three things. Tonight it is late. Go to sleep tomorrow I will tell you.Early the following morning the prince received a message that Kostiei was ready to see him. He got up and dressed and hastened to the presence chamber where the little king was seated on his throne. When the prince appeared bowing low before him Kostiei beganNow Prince this is what you have to do. By tonight you must build me a marble palace with windows of crystal and a roof of gold. It is to stand in the middle of a great park full of streams and lakes. If you are able to build it you shall be my friend. If not off with your head.The prince listened in silence to this startling speech and then returning to his room set himself to think about the certain death that awaited him. He was quite absorbed in these thoughts when suddenly a bee flew against the window and tapped saying Let me come in. He rose and opened the window and there stood before him the youngest princess.What are you dreaming about PrinceI was dreaming of your father who has planned my death.Fear nothing. You may sleep in peace and tomorrow morning when you awake you will find the palace all ready.What she said she did. The next morning when the prince left his room he saw before him a palace more beautiful than his fancy had ever pictured. Kostiei for his part could hardly believe his eyes and pondered deeply how it had got there.Well this time you have certainly won but you are not going to be let off so easily. Tomorrow all my twelve daughters shall stand in a row before you and if you cannot tell me which of them is the youngest off goes your head.What Not recognise the youngest princess said the Prince to himself as he entered his room a likely storyIt is such a difficult matter that you will never be able to do it without my help replied the bee who was buzzing about the ceiling. We are all so exactly alike that even our father scarcely knows the difference between us.Then what must I doThis. The youngest is she who will have a ladybird on her eyelid. Be very careful. Now goodbye.Next morning King Kostiei again sent for the prince. The young princesses were all drawn up in a row dressed precisely in the same manner and with their eyes all cast down. As the prince looked at them he was amazed at their likeness. Twice he walked along the line without being able to detect the sign agreed upon. The third time his heart beat fast at the sight of a tiny speck upon the eyelid of one of the girls.This one is the youngest he said.How in the world did you guess cried Kostiei in a fury. There is some jugglery about it But you are not going to escape me so easily. In three hours you shall come here and give me another proof of your cleverness. I shall set alight a handful of straw and before it is burnt up you will have turned it into a pair of boots. If not off goes your head.So the prince returned sadly into his room but the bee was there before him.Why do you look so melancholy my handsome PrinceHow can I help looking melancholy when your father has ordered me to make him a pair of boots Does he take me for a shoemakerWhat do you think of doingNot of making boots at any rate I am not afraid of death. One can only die once after all.No Prince you shall not die. I will try to save you. And we will fly together or die together.As she spoke she spat upon the ground and then drawing the prince after her out of the room she locked the door behind her and threw away the key. Holding each other tight by the hand they made their way up into the sunlight and found themselves by the side of the same sea while the princes horse was still quietly feeding in the neighbouring meadow. The moment he saw his master the horse whinnied and galloped towards him. Without losing an instant the prince sprang into the saddle swung the princess behind him and away they went like an arrow from a bow.When the hour arrived which Kostiei had fixed for the princes last trial and there were no signs of him the king sent to his room to ask why he delayed so long. The servants finding the door locked knocked loudly and received for answer In one moment. It was the spittle which was imitating the voice of the prince.The answer was taken back to Kostiei. He waited still no prince. He sent the servants back again and the same voice replied Immediately.He is making fun of me shrieked Kostiei in a rage. Break in the door and bring him to meThe servants hurried to do his bidding. The door was broken open. Nobody inside but just the spittle in fits of laughter Kostiei was beside himself with rage and commanded his guards to ride after the fugitives. If the guards returned without the fugitives their heads should pay for it.By this time the prince and princess had got a good start and were feeling quite happy when suddenly they heard the sound of a gallop far behind them. The prince sprang from the saddle and laid his ear to the ground.They are pursuing us he said.Then there is no time to be lost answered the princess and as she spoke she changed herself into a river the prince into a bridge the horse into a crow and divided the wide road beyond the bridge into three little ones. When the soldiers came up to the bridge they paused uncertainly. How were they to know which of the three roads the fugitives had taken They gave it up in despair and returned in trembling to Kostiei.Idiots he exclaimed in a passion. They were the bridge and the river of course Do you mean to say you never thought of that Go back at once and off they galloped like lightning.But time had been lost and the prince and princess were far on their way.I hear a horse cried the princess.The prince jumped down and laid his ear to the ground.Yes he said they are not far off now.In an instant prince princess and horse had all disappeared and instead was a dense forest crossed and recrossed by countless paths. Kostieis soldiers dashed hastily into the forest believing they saw before them the flying horse with its double burden. They seemed close upon them when suddenly horse wood everything disappeared and they found themselves at the place where they started. There was nothing for it but to return to Kostiei and tell him of this fresh disaster.A horse a horse cried the king. I will go after them myself. This time they shall not escape. And he galloped off foaming with anger.I think I hear someone pursuing us said the princessYes so do I.And this time it is Kostiei himself. But his power only reaches as far as the first church and he can go no farther. Give me your golden cross. So the prince unfastened the cross which was his mothers gift and the princess hastily changed herself into a church the prince into a priest and the horse into a belfry.It was hardly done when Kostiei came up.Greeting monk. Have you seen some travellers on horseback pass this wayYes the prince and Kostieis daughter have just gone by. They have entered the church and told me to give you their greetings if I met you.Then Kostiei knew that he had been hopelessly beaten and the prince and princess continued their journey without any more adventures.
A Man once bought an Ethiopian slave who had a black skin like all Ethiopians but his new master thought his colour was due to his late owners having neglected him and that all he wanted was a good scrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of soap and hot water and rubbed away at him with a will but all to no purpose his skin remained as black as ever while the poor wretch all but died from the cold he caught.
A Tinguian was once walking along a trail in the wood when he heard a strange sound in a large tree near him and looking up he was startled to see that it was the home of the Alanspirits who live in the wood.He stopped and gazed for a moment at the horrible creatures large as people hanging from the limbs of the tree with their heads down like bats. They had wings to fly and their toes were at the back of their feet while their long fingers which pointed backward were fastened at the wrist.Surely thought the man these terrible beings will eat me if they can catch me. I will run away as fast as I can while they are asleep. He tried to run but he was too frightened and after a few steps he fell face down on the ground.At this the Alan began to wail loudly for they saw him fall and believed him dead And they came down out of the tree with gold and beads which they laid on him.After a while the man gathered courage and jumping up he cried as loudly as he could Go awayThereupon the man went home as fast as he could go but very soon after that his house burned for the Alan kept their word.
Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife in a dirty tumbledown cottage not very far from the splendid palace where the king and queen dwelt. In spite of the wretched state of the hut which many people declared was too bad even for a pig to live in the old man was very rich for he was a great miser and lucky besides and would often go without food all day sooner than change one of his beloved gold pieces.But after a while he found that he had starved himself once too often. He fell ill and had no strength to get well again and in a few days he died leaving his wife and one son behind him.The night following his death the son dreamed that an unknown man appeared to him and said Listen to me your father is dead and your mother will soon die and all their riches will belong to you. Half of his wealth is illgotten and this you must give back to the poor from whom he squeezed it. The other half you must throw into the sea. Watch however as the money sinks into the water and if anything should swim catch it and keep it even if it is nothing more than a bit of paper.Then the man vanished and the youth awoke.The remembrance of his dream troubled him greatly. He did not want to part with the riches that his father had left him for he had known all his life what it was to be cold and hungry and now he had hoped for a little comfort and pleasure. Still he was honest and goodhearted and if his father had come wrongfully by his wealth he felt he could never enjoy it and at last he made up his mind to do as he had been bidden. He found out who were the people who were poorest in the village and spent half of his money in helping them and the other half he put in his pocket. From a rock that jutted right out into the sea he flung it in. In a moment it was out of sight and no man could have told the spot where it had sunk except for a tiny scrap of paper floating on the water. He stretched down carefully and managed to reach it and on opening it found six shillings wrapped inside. This was now all the money he had in the world.The young man stood and looked at it thoughtfully. Well I cant do much with this he said to himself but after all six shillings were better than nothing and he wrapped them up again and slipped them into his coat.He worked in his garden for the next few weeks and he and his mother contrived to live on the fruit and vegetables he got out of it and then she too died suddenly. The poor fellow felt very sad when he had laid her in her grave and with a heavy heart he wandered into the forest not knowing where he was going. Byandby he began to get hungry and seeing a small hut in front of him he knocked at the door and asked if they could give him some milk. The old woman who opened it begged him to come in adding kindly that if he wanted a nights lodging he might have it without its costing him anything.Two women and three men were at supper when he entered and silently made room for him to sit down by them. When he had eaten he began to look about him and was surprised to see an animal sitting by the fire different from anything he had ever noticed before. It was grey in colour and not very big but its eyes were large and very bright and it seemed to be singing in an odd way quite unlike any animal in the forest. What is the name of that strange little creature asked he. And they answered We call it a cat.I should like to buy itif it is not too dear said the young man it would be company for me. And they told him that he might have it for six shillings if he cared to give so much. The young man took out his precious bit of paper handed them the six shillings and the next morning bade them farewell with the cat lying snugly in his cloak.For the whole day they wandered through meadows and forests till in the evening they reached a house. The young fellow knocked at the door and asked the old man who opened it if he could rest there that night adding that he had no money to pay for it. Then I must give it to you answered the man and led him into a room where two women and two men were sitting at supper. One of the women was the old mans wife the other his daughter. He placed the cat on the mantel shelf and they all crowded round to examine this strange beast and the cat rubbed itself against them and held out its paw and sang to them and the women were delighted and gave it everything that a cat could eat and a great deal more besides.After hearing the youths story and how he had nothing in the world left him except his cat the old man advised him to go to the palace which was only a few miles distant and take counsel of the king who was kind to everyone and would certainly be his friend. The young man thanked him and said he would gladly take his advice and early next morning he set out for the royal palace.He sent a message to the king to beg for an audience and received a reply that he was to go into the great hall where he would find his Majesty.The king was at dinner with his court when the young man entered and he signed to him to come near. The youth bowed low and then gazed in surprise at the crowd of little black creatures who were running about the floor and even on the table itself. Indeed they were so bold that they snatched pieces of food from the Kings own plate and if he drove them away tried to bite his hands so that he could not eat his food and his courtiers fared no better.What sort of animals are these asked the youth of one of the ladies sitting near him.They are called rats answered the king who had overheard the question and for years we have tried some way of putting an end to them but it is impossible. They come into our very beds.At this moment something was seen flying through the air. The cat was on the table and with two or three shakes a number of rats were lying dead round him. Then a great scuffling of feet was heard and in a few minutes the hall was clear.For some minutes the King and his courtiers only looked at each other in astonishment. What kind of animal is that which can work magic of this sort asked he. And the young man told him that it was called a cat and that he had bought it for six shillings.And the King answered Because of the luck you have brought me in freeing my palace from the plague which has tormented me for many years I will give you the choice of two things. Either you shall be my Prime Minister or else you shall marry my daughter and reign after me. Say which shall it beThe princess and the kingdom said the young man.And so it was.
Once upon a timein the days when the fairies lived there was a king who had three daughters who were all young and clever and beautiful but the youngest of the three who was called Miranda was the prettiest and the most beloved.The King her father gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than he gave the others in a year but she was so generous that she shared everything with her sisters and they were all as happy and as fond of one another as they could be.Now the King had some quarrelsome neighbors who tired of leaving him in peace began to make war upon him so fiercely that he feared he would be altogether beaten if he did not make an effort to defend himself. So he collected a great army and set off to fight them leaving the Princesses with their governess in a castle where news of the war was brought every daysometimes that the King had taken a town or won a battle and at last that he had altogether overcome his enemies and chased them out of his kingdom and was coming back to the castle as quickly as possible to see his dear little Miranda whom he loved so much.The three Princesses put on dresses of satin which they had had made on purpose for this great occasion one green one blue and the third white their jewels were the same colors. The eldest wore emeralds the second turquoises and the youngest diamonds and thus adorned they went to meet the King singing verses which they had composed about his victories.When he saw them all so beautiful and so gay he embraced them tenderly but gave Miranda more kisses than either of the others.Presently a splendid banquet was served and the King and his daughters sat down to it and as he always thought that there was some special meaning in everything he said to the eldestTell me why you have chosen a green dress.Sire she answered having heard of your victories I thought that green would signify my joy and the hope of your speedy return.That is a very good answer said the King and you my daughter he continued why did you take a blue dressSire said the Princess to show that we constantly hoped for your success and that the sight of you is as welcome to me as the sky with its most beautiful stars.Why said the King your wise answers astonish me and you Miranda. What made you dress yourself all in whiteBecause sire she answered white suits me better than anything else.What said the King angrily was that all you thought of vain childI thought you would be pleased with me said the Princess that was all.The King who loved her was satisfied with this and even pretended to be pleased that she had not told him all her reasons at first.And now said he as I have supped well and it is not time yet to go to bed tell me what you dreamed last night.The eldest said she had dreamed that he brought her a dress and the precious stones and gold embroidery on it were brighter than the sun.The dream of the second was that the King had brought her a spinning wheel and a distaff that she might spin him some shirts.But the youngest said I dreamed that my second sister was to be married and on her weddingday you father held a golden ewer and said Come Miranda and I will hold the water that you may dip your hands in it.The King was very angry indeed when he heard this dream and frowned horribly indeed he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry he was and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry but he could not forget his daughters dream.Does the proud girl wish to make me her slave he said to himself. I am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without a thought of me. She does not think me worthy of her consideration But I will soon put an end to her pretensionsHe rose in a fury and although it was not yet daylight he sent for the Captain of his Bodyguard and said to himYou have heard the Princess Mirandas dream I consider that it means strange things against me therefore I order you to take her away into the forest and kill her and that I may be sure it is done you must bring me her heart and her tongue. If you attempt to deceive me you shall be put to deathThe Captain of the Guard was very much astonished when he heard this barbarous order but he did not dare to contradict the King for fear of making him still more angry or causing him to send someone else so he answered that he would fetch the Princess and do as the King had said. When he went to her room they would hardly let him in it was so early but he said that the King had sent for Miranda and she got up quickly and came out a little black girl called Patypata held up her train and her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her. The monkey was called Grabugeon and the little dog Tintin.The Captain of the Guard begged Miranda to come down into the garden where the King was enjoying the fresh air and when they got there he pretended to search for him but as he was not to be found he saidNo doubt his Majesty has strolled into the forest and he opened the little door that led to it and they went through.By this time the daylight had begun to appear and the Princess looking at her conductor saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad to speak.What is the matter she said in the kindest way. You seem very sorrowful.Alas Princess he answered who would not be sorrowful who was ordered to do such a terrible thing as I am The King has commanded me to kill you here and carry your heart and your tongue to him and if I disobey I shall lose my life.The poor Princess was terrified she grew very pale and began to cry softly.Looking up at the Captain of the Guard with her beautiful eyes she said gentlyWill you really have the heart to kill me I have never done you any harm and have always spoken well of you to the King. If I had deserved my fathers anger I would suffer without a murmur but alas he is unjust to complain of me when I have always treated him with love and respect.Fear nothing Princess said the Captain of the Guard. I would far rather die myself than hurt you but even if I am killed you will not be safe we must find some way of making the King believe that you are dead.What can we do said Miranda unless you take him my heart and my tongue he will never believe you.The Princess and the Captain of the Guard were talking so earnestly that they did not think of Patypata but she had overheard all they said and now came and threw herself at Mirandas feetMadam she said I offer you my life let me be killed I shall be only too happy to die for such a kind mistress.Why Patypata cried the Princess kissing her that would never do your life is as precious to me as my own especially after such a proof of your affection as you have just given me.You are right Princess said Grabugeon coming forward to love such a faithful slave as Patypata she is of more use to you than I am I offer you my tongue and my heart most willingly especially as I wish to make a great name for myself in Goblin Land.No no my little Grabugeon replied Miranda I cannot bear the thought of taking your life.Such a good little dog as I am cried Tintin acould not think of letting either of you die for his mistress. If anyone is to die for her it must be me.And then began a great dispute between Patypata Grabugeon and Tintin and they came to high words until at last Grabugeon who was quicker than the others ran up to the very top of the nearest tree and let herself fall head first to the ground and there she layquite deadThe Princess was very sorry but as Grabugeon was really dead she allowed the Captain of the Guard to take her tongue but alas it was such a little onenot bigger than the Princesss thumbthat they decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all the King would not have been taken in by it for a momentAlas my little monkey cried the Princess I have lost you and yet I am no better off than I was before.The honor of saving your life is to be mine interrupted Patypata and before they could prevent her she had picked up a knife and cut her head off in an instant.But when the Captain of the Guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black so that would not have deceived the King either.Am I not unlucky cried the poor Princess I lose everything I love and am none the better for it.If you had accepted my offer said Tintin you would only have had me to regret and I should have had all your gratitude.Miranda kissed her little dog crying so bitterly that at last she could bear it no longer and turned away into the forest. When she looked back the Captain of the Guard was gone and she was alone except for Patypata Grabugeon and Tintin who lay upon the ground. She could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree and how they had all died to save her life. And then she began to think where she could go for safetyfor this forest was so close to her fathers castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first passerby and besides that it was full of lions and wolves who would have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken. So she began to walk as fast as she could but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King running after her to kill her. You may imagine how miserable she was and how she cried as she went on not knowing which path to follow and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces.At last she heard the bleating of a sheep and said to herselfNo doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks they will show me the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl. Alas it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world. Who could have believed that I should ever be obliged to run away and hide because the King for no reason at all wishes to kill meSo saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating but what was her surprise when in a lovely little glade quite surrounded by trees she saw a large sheep its wool was as white as snow and its horns shone like gold it had a garland of flowers round its neck and strings of great pearls about its legs and a collar of diamonds it lay upon a bank of orangeflowers under a canopy of cloth of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun. Nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about not eating the grass but some drinking coffee lemonade or sherbet others eating ices strawberries and cream or sweetmeats while others again were playing games. Many of them wore golden collars with jewels flowers and ribbons.Miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight and was looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her.Approach lovely Princess he cried have no fear of such gentle and peaceable animals as we are.What a marvel cried the Princess starting back a little. Here is a sheep that can talk.Your monkey and your dog could talk madam said he are you more astonished at us than at themA fairy gave them the power to speak replied Miranda. So I was used to them.Perhaps the same thing has happened to us he said smiling sheepishly. But Princess what can have led you hereA thousand misfortunes Sir Sheep she answered.I am the unhappiest princess in the world and I am seeking a shelter against my fathers anger.Come with me madam said the Sheep I offer you a hidingplace which you only will know of and where you will be mistress of everything you see.I really cannot follow you said Miranda for I am too tired to walk another step.The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched and a moment after appeared six goats harnessed to a pumpkin which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down. The Princess stepped into it much amused at such a new kind of carriage the King of the Sheep took his place beside her and the goats ran away with them at full speed and only stopped when they reached a cavern the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone. This the King touched with his foot and immediately it fell down and he invited the Princess to enter without fear. Now if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment. So without hesitation she followed the Sheep who went before her down down down until she thought they must come out at the other side of the worldindeed she was not sure that he wasnt leading her into Fairyland. At last she saw before her a great plain quite covered with all sorts of flowers the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before a broad river of orangeflower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks. The plain was covered with the strangest trees there were whole avenues where partridges ready roasted hung from every branch or if you preferred pheasants quails turkeys or rabbits you had only to turn to the right hand or to the left and you were sure to find them. In places the air was darkened by showers of lobsterpatties white puddings sausages tarts and all sorts of sweetmeats or with pieces of gold and silver diamonds and pearls. This unusual kind of rain and the pleasantness of the whole place would no doubt have attracted numbers of people to it if the King of the Sheep had been of a more sociable disposition but from all accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge.As it was quite the nicest time of the year when Miranda arrived in this delightful land the only palace she saw was a long row of orange trees jasmines honeysuckles and muskroses and their interlacing branches made the prettiest rooms possible which were hung with gold and silver gauze and had great mirrors and candlesticks and most beautiful pictures. The Wonderful Sheep begged that the Princess would consider herself queen over all that she saw and assured her that though for some years he had been very sad and in great trouble she had it in her power to make him forget all his grief.You are so kind and generous noble Sheep said the Princess that I cannot thank you enough but I must confess that all I see here seems to me so extraordinary that I dont know what to think of it.As she spoke a band of lovely fairies came up and offered her amber baskets full of fruit but when she held out her hands to them they glided away and she could feel nothing when she tried to touch them.Oh she cried what can they be Whom am I with and she began to cry.At this instant the King of the Sheep came back to her and was so distracted to find her in tears that he could have torn his wool.What is the matter lovely Princess he cried. Has anyone failed to treat you with due respectOh no said Miranda only I am not used to living with sprites and with sheep that talk and everything here frightens me. It was very kind of you to bring me to this place but I shall be even more grateful to you if you will take me up into the world again.Do not be afraid said the Wonderful Sheep I entreat you to have patience and listen to the story of my misfortunes. I was once a king and my kingdom was the most splendid in the world. My subjects loved me my neighbors envied and feared me. I was respected by everyone and it was said that no king ever deserved it more.I was very fond of hunting and one day while chasing a stag I left my attendants far behind suddenly I saw the animal leap into a pool of water and I rashly urged my horse to follow it but before we had gone many steps I felt an extraordinary heat instead of the coolness of the water the pond dried up a great gulf opened before me out of which flames of fire shot up and I fell helplessly to the bottom of a precipice.I gave myself up for lost but presently a voice said Ungrateful Prince even this fire is hardly enough to warm your cold heartWho complains of my coldness in this dismal place I cried.An unhappy being who loves you hopelessly replied the voice and at the same moment the flames began to flicker and cease to burn and I saw a fairy whom I had known as long as I could remember and whose ugliness had always horrified me. She was leaning upon the arm of a most beautiful young girl who wore chains of gold on her wrists and was evidently her slave.Why Ragotte I said for that was the fairys name what is the meaning of all this Is it by your orders that I am hereAnd whose fault is it she answered that you have never understood me until now Must a powerful fairy like myself condescend to explain her doings to you who are no better than an ant by comparison though you think yourself a great kingCall me what you like I said impatiently but what is it that you wantmy crown or my cities or my treasuresTreasures said the fairy disdainfully. If I chose I could make any one of my scullions richer and more powerful than you. I do not want your treasures but she added softly if you will give me your heartif you will marry meI will add twenty kingdoms to the one you have already you shall have a hundred castles full of gold and five hundred full of silver and in short anything you like to ask me for.Madam Ragotte said I when one is at the bottom of a pit where one has fully expected to be roasted alive it is impossible to think of asking such a charming per son as you are to marry one I beg that you will set me at liberty and then I shall hope to answer you fittingly.Ah said she if you really loved me you would not care where you werea cave a wood a foxhole a desert would please you equally well. Do not think that you can deceive me you fancy you are going to escape but I assure you that you are going to stay here and the first thing I shall give you to do will be to keep my sheepthey are very good company and speak quite as well as you do.As she spoke she advanced and led me to this plain where we now stand and showed me her flock but I paid little attention to it or to her.To tell the truth I was so lost in admiration of her beautiful slave that I forgot everything else and the cruel Ragotte perceiving this turned upon her so furious and terrible a look that she fell lifeless to the ground.At this dreadful sight I drew my sword and rushed at Ragotte and should certainly have cut off her head had she not by her magic arts chained me to the spot on which I stood all my efforts to move were useless and at last when I threw myself down on the ground in despair she said to me with a scornful smileI intend to make you feel my power. It seems that you are a lion at present I mean you to be a sheep.So saying she touched me with her wand and I became what you see. I did not lose the power of speech or of feeling the misery of my present state.For five years she said you shall be a sheep and lord of this pleasant land while I no longer able to see your face which I loved so much shall be better able to hate you as you deserve to be hated.She disappeared as she finished speaking and if I had not been too unhappy to care about anything I should have been glad that she was gone.The talking sheep received me as their king and told me that they too were unfortunate princes who had in different ways offended the revengeful fairy and had been added to her flock for a certain number of years some more some less. From time to time indeed one regains his own proper form and goes back again to his place in the upper world but the other beings whom you saw are the rivals or the enemies of Ragotte whom she has imprisoned for a hundred years or so though even they will go back at last. The young slave of whom I told you about is one of these I have seen her often and it has been a great pleasure to me. She never speaks to me and if I were nearer to her I know I should find her only a shadow which would be very annoying. However I noticed that one of my companions in misfortune was also very attentive to this little sprite and I found out that he had been her lover whom the cruel Ragotte had taken away from her long before since then I have cared for and thought of nothing but how I might regain my freedom. I have often been in the forest that is where I have seen you lovely Princess sometimes driving your chariot which you did with all the grace and skill in the world sometimes riding to the chase on so spirited a horse that it seemed as if no one but yourself could have managed it and sometimes running races on the plain with the Princesses of your Courtrunning so lightly that it was you always who won the prize. Oh Princess I have loved you so long and yet how dare I tell you of my love what hope can there be for an unhappy sheep like myselfMiranda was so surprised and confused by all that she had heard that she hardly knew what answer to give to the King of the Sheep but she managed to make some kind of little speech which certainly did not forbid him to hope and said that she should not be afraid of the shadows now she knew that they would some day come to life again. Alas she continued if my poor Patypata my dear Grabugeon and pretty little Tintin who all died for my sake were equally well off I should have nothing left to wish for herePrisoner though he was the King of the Sheep had still some powers and privileges.Go said he to his Master of the Horse go and seek the shadows of the little black girl the monkey and the dog they will amuse our Princess.And an instant afterward Miranda saw them coming toward her and their presence gave her the greatest pleasure though they did not come near enough for her to touch them.The King of the Sheep was so kind and amusing and loved Miranda so dearly that at last she began to love him too. Such a handsome sheep who was so polite and considerate could hardly fail to please especially if one knew that he was really a king and that his strange imprisonment would soon come to an end. So the Princesss days passed very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come. The King of the Sheep with the help of all the flock got up balls concerts and hunting parties and even the shadows joined in all the fun and came making believe to be their own real selves.One evening when the couriers arrived for the King sent most carefully for newsand they always brought the very best kinds it was announced that the sister of the Princess Miranda was going to be married to a great Prince and that nothing could be more splendid than all the preparations for the wedding.Ah cried the young Princess how unlucky I am to miss the sight of so many pretty things Here am I imprisoned under the earth with no company but sheep and shadows while my sister is to be adorned like a queen and surrounded by all who love and admire her and everyone but myself can go to wish her joyWhy do you complain Princess said the King of the Sheep. Did I say that you were not to go to the wedding Set out as soon as you please only promise me that you will come back for I love you too much to be able to live without you.Miranda was very grateful to him and promised faithfully that nothing in the world should keep her from coming back. The King caused an escort suitable to her rank to be got ready for her and she dressed herself splendidly not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful. Her chariot was of motherofpearl drawn by six duncolored griffins just brought from the other side of the world and she was attended by a number of guards in splendid uniforms who were all at least eight feet high and had come from far and near to ride in the Princesss train.Miranda reached her fathers palace just as the wedding ceremony began and everyone as soon as she came in was struck with surprise at her beauty and the splendor of her jewels. She heard exclamations of admiration on all sides and the King her father looked at her so attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her but he was so sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him.However the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over. She went out hastily leaving behind her a little coral casket set with emeralds. On it was written in diamond letters Jewels for the Bride and when they opened it which they did as soon as it was found there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained. The King who had hoped to join the unknown Princess and find out who she was was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly and gave orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she might not get away so easily. Short as Mirandas absence had been it had seemed like a hundred years to the King of the Sheep. He was waiting for her by a fountain in the thickest part of the forest and the ground was strewn with splendid presents which he had prepared for her to show his joy and gratitude at her coming back.As soon as she was in sight he rushed to meet her leaping and bounding like a real sheep. He caressed her tenderly throwing himself at her feet and kissing her hands and told her how uneasy he had been in her absence and how impatient for her return with an eloquence which charmed her.After some time came the news that the Kings second daughter was going to be married. When Miranda heard it she begged the King of the Sheep to allow her to go and see the wedding as before. This request made him feel very sad as if some misfortune must surely come of it but his love for the Princess being stronger than anything else he did not like to refuse her.You wish to leave me Princess said he it is my unhappy fateyou are not to blame. I consent to your going but believe me I can give you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing.The Princess assured him that she would only stay a very short time as she had done before and begged him not to be uneasy as she would be quite as much grieved if anything detained her as he could possibly be.So with the same escort she set out and reached the palace as the marriage ceremony began. Everybody was delighted to see her she was so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess and the Princes who were there could not take their eyes off her.The King was more glad than anyone else that she had come again and gave orders that the doors should all be shut and bolted that very minute. When the wedding was all but over the Princess got up quickly hoping to slip away unnoticed among the crowd but to her great dismay she found every door fastened.She felt more at ease when the King came up to her and with the greatest respect begged her not to run away so soon but at least to honor him by staying for the splendid feast which was prepared for the Princes and Princesses. He led her into a magnificent hall where all the Court was assembled and himself taking up the golden bowl full of water he offered it to her that she might dip her pretty fingers into it.At this the Princess could no longer contain herself throwing herself at the Kings feet she cried outMy dream has come true after allyou have offered me water to wash my hands on my sisters wedding day and it has not vexed you to do it.The King recognized her at onceindeed he had already thought several times how much like his poor little Miranda she was.Oh my dear daughter he cried kissing her can you ever forget my cruelty I ordered you to be put to death because I thought your dream portended the loss of my crown. And so it did he added for now your sisters are both married and have kingdoms of their ownand mine shall be for you. So saying he put his crown on the Princesss head and criedLong live Queen MirandaAll the Court cried Long live Queen Miranda after him and the young Queens two sisters came running up and threw their arms round her neck and kissed her a thousand times and then there was such a laughing and crying talking and kissing all at once and Miranda thanked her father and began to ask after everyone particularly the Captain of the Guard to whom she owed so much but to her great sorrow she heard that he was dead. Presently they sat down to the banquet and the King asked Miranda to tell them all that had happened to her since the terrible morning when he had sent the Captain of the Guard to fetch her. This she did with so much spirit that all the guests listened with breathless interest. But while she was thus enjoying herself with the King and her sisters the King of the Sheep was waiting impatiently for the time of her return and when it came and went and no Princess appeared his anxiety became so great that he could bear it no longer.She is not coming back any more he cried. My miserable sheeps face displeases her and without Miranda what is left to me wretched creature that I am Oh cruel Ragotte my punishment is complete.For a long time he bewailed his sad fate like this and then seeing that it was growing dark and that still there was no sign of the Princess he set out as fast as he could in the direction of the town. When he reached the palace he asked for Miranda but by this time everyone had heard the story of her adventures and did not want her to go back again to the King of the Sheep so they refused sternly to let him see her. In vain he begged and prayed them to let him in though his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the guards of the palace and at last quite brokenhearted he fell dead at their feet.In the meantime the King who had not the least idea of the sad thing that was happening outside the gate of his palace proposed to Miranda that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches placed in windows and balconies and in all the grand squares. But what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace There lay her dear kind sheep silent and motionless upon the pavementShe threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him crying bitterly for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life and for a long long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have died too.So you see that even a princess is not always happy especially if she forgets to keep her word and the greatest misfortunes often happen to people just as they think they have obtained their hearts desires
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons. When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country and for many years no one heard anything about him. Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father who died at last in a good old age leaving great riches behind him.For some time the son who stayed at home spent his fathers wealth freely believing that he alone remained to enjoy it. But one day as he was coming down stairs he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall looking about as if the house belonged to him.Have you forgotten me asked the man.I cant forget a person I have never known was the rude answer.I am your brother replied the stranger and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made. And what is worse they tell me in the village that my father is dead. I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more.He died six months ago said the rich brother and he left you as your portion the old wooden chest that stands in the loft. You had better go there and look for it I have no more time to waste. And he went his way.So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft which was at the top of the storehouse and there he found the wooden chest so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces.What use is this old thing to me he said to himself. Oh well it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself so things might be worse after all.Placing the chest on his back the man whose name was Jose set out for his inn and borrowing a hatchet began to chop up the box. In doing so he discovered a secret drawer and in it lay a paper. He opened the paper not knowing what it might contain and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father. Putting the precious writing in his pocket he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside and he ran out at once in search of him.The debtor proved to be an old miser who lived at the other end of the village. He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed and indeed when he saw it was very unwilling to pay what he owed. However the stranger threatened to drag him before the king and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one. The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man.A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town when he met a poor woman crying bitterly. He stopped and asked her what was the matter and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying and to make matters worse a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison.Comfort yourself said the stranger kindly they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods. I will not only pay his debts but if he dies the cost of his burial also. And now go home and nurse him as well as you can.And so she did but in spite of her care the husband died and was buried by the stranger. But everything cost more than he expected and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left.What am I to do now said he to himself. I think I had better go to court and enter into the service of the king.At first he was only a servant who carried the king the water for his bath and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion. But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber.Now when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited and did not know how to make any for himself. He then bethought him of the kings favourite and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother whom he had so illused would give him his protection and find him a place. The elder who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf and the next day the young man took up is work at court.Unfortunately the newcomer was by nature spiteful and envious and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself. By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors he learned that the king old and ugly though he was had fallen in love with the Princess BellaFlor who would have nothing to say to him and had hidden herself in some mountain castle no one knew where.That will do nicely thought the scoundrel rubbing his hands. It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her and if he returns without finding her his head will be the forfeit. Either way he will be out of MY path.So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance. The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay and bade him state what he had to say and to be quick about it.Oh sire the Princess BellaFlor answered the man and then stopped as if afraid.What of the Princess BellaFlor asked the king impatiently.I have heardit is whispered at courtthat your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding.I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me cried the king eagerly. Speak on knave has a bird of the air revealed to you the secretIt is not I but my brother who knows replied the traitor if your majesty would ask him But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall.Order Jose to appear before me instantly he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders so great was the noise his majesty had made and when Jose entered the hall wondering what in the world could be the matter the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement.Bring me the Princess BellaFlor this moment stammered he for if you return without her I will have you drowned And without another word he left the hall leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror.How can I find the Princess BellaFlor when I have never even seen her thought he. But it is no use staying here for I shall only be put to death. And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse.There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other wondering which he should choose when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach.Take me it said in a gentle whisper and all will go well.Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk. Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable. He was about to mount on his back when the animal spoke againPick up those three loaves of bread which you see there and put them in your pocket.Jose did as he was told and being in a great hurry to get away asked no questions but swung himself into the saddle.They rode far without meeting any adventures but at length they came to an anthill and the horse stopped.Crumble those three loaves for the ants he said. But Jose hesitated.Why we may want them ourselves answered he.Never mind that give them to the ants all the same. Do not lose a chance of helping others. And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road the horse galloped on.Byandby they entered a rocky pass between two mountains and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunters net.Get down and cut the meshes of the net and set the poor bird free said the horse.But it will take so long objected Jose and we may miss the princess.Never mind that do not lose a chance of helping others answered the horse. And when the meshes were cut and the eagle was free the horse galloped on.The had ridden many miles and at last they came to a river where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand and the horse saidDo you see that little fish It will die if you do not put it back in the water.But really we shall never find the Princess BellaFlor if we waste our time like this cried Jose.We never waste time when we are helping others answered the horse. And soon the little fish was swimming happily away.How Jose found the Princess BellafFlor. .Illustration by H.J Ford. Published in The Orange Fairy Book by Andrew Lang 1906 Longmans Green and Company.A little while after they reached a castle which was built in the middle of a very thick wood and right in front was the Princess BellaFlor feeding her hens.Now listen said the horse. I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips which will amuse the Princess BellaFlor. Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way and you must help her to mount. When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick and you must say that I have never carried a woman before and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me. Once on my back we will go like the wind to the kings palace.Jose did exactly as the horse told him and everything fell out as the animal prophesied so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive. She said nothing however but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground.Oh I have let fall my bran cried she please get down and pick it up for me. But Jose only answeredWe shall find plenty of bran where we are going. And the horse galloped on.They were now passing through a forest and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree.Dear me how stupid I have let my handkerchief blow away said she. Will you climb up and get it for me But Jose answeredWe shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going. And the horse galloped on.After the wood they reached a river and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water.How careless of me gasped she beginning to sob. I have lost my favourite ring DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it. But Jose answeredYou will find plenty of rings where you are going. And the horse galloped on.At last they entered the palace gates and the kings heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess BellaFlor. But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly and locked herself into the nearest room which she would not open for all his entreaties.Bring me the three things I lost on the way and perhaps I may think about it was all she would say. And in despair the king was driven to take counsel of Jose.There is no remedy that I can see said his majesty but that you who know where they are should go and bring them back. And if you return without them I will have you drowned.Poor Jose was much troubled at these words. He thought that he had done all that was required of him and that his life was safe. However he bowed low and went out to consult his friend the horse.Do not vex yourself said the horse when he had heard the story jump up and we will go and look for the things. And Jose mounted at once.They rode on till they came to the anthill and then the horse askedWould you like to have the branWhat is the use of liking answered Jose.Well call the ants and tell them to fetch it for you and if some of it has been scattered by the wind to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them. Jose listened in surprise. He did not much believe in the horses plan but he could not think of anything better so he called to the ants and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could.Then he saw under a tree and waited while his horse cropped the green turf.Look there said the animal suddenly raising its head and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle.Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later observed the horse but mount again as we have far to go.When they arrived at the tree they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch and Joses spirits sank again.How am I to get that handkerchief cried he why I should need Jacobs ladder But the horse answeredDo not be frightened call to the eagle you set free from the net he will bring it to you.So Jose called to the eagle and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak. Jose thanked him and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river.A great deal of rain had fallen in the night and the river instead of being clear as it was before was dark and troubled.How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped and cannot even see it asked Jose. But the horse answered Do not be frightened call the little fish whose life you saved and she will bring it to you.So he called to the fish and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring and brought it to Jose in its mouth.Well pleased with all he had done Jose returned to the palace but when the king took the precious objects to BellaFlor she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil.I am very sorry said the king to Jose I really would rather not but you see I have no choice.While the oil was being heated in the great caldron Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape.Do not be frightened said the horse. Get on my back and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration then rub it all over your skin and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it.Jose did not ask any more questions but did as the horse bade him and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil. He was left there till BellaFlor cried that he must be cooked enough. Then out came a youth so young and handsome that everyone fell in love with him and BellaFlor most of all.As for the old king he saw that he had lost the game and in despair he flung himself into the caldron and was fried instead of Jose. Then Jose was proclaimed king on condition that he married BellaFlor which he promised to do the next day. But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse and said to him It is to you that I owe my life and my crown. Why have you done all this for meAnd the horse answered I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune. And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you as you had helped me. For as I told you Good deeds bear their own fruit
Long long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife. The old man was a good kindhearted hardworking old fellow but his wife was a regular crosspatch who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue. She was always grumbling about something from morning to night. The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness. He was out most of the day at work in the fields and as he had no child for his amusement when he came home he kept a tame sparrow. He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.When he came back at night after his hard days work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow to talk to her and to teach her little tricks which she learned very quickly. The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room and they would play together. Then when suppertime came he always saved some titbits from his meal with which to feed his little bird.Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes. The day before she had made some starch and now when she came to look for it it was all gone the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty.While she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch down flew the pet sparrow and bowing her little feathered heada trick which she had been taught by her masterthe pretty bird chirped and saidIt is I who have taken the starch. I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin and I ate it all. If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me tweet tweet tweetYou see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird and the old woman ought to have been willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely. But not so.The old woman had never loved the sparrow and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping what she called a dirty bird about the house saying that it only made extra work for her. Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet. She scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior and not content with using these harsh unfeeling words in a fit of rage she seized the sparrowwho all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman to show how sorry she wasand fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little birds tongue.I suppose you took my starch with that tongue Now you may see what it is like to go without it And with these dreadful words she drove the bird away not caring in the least what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering so unkind was sheThe old woman after she had driven the sparrow away made some more ricepaste grumbling all the time at the trouble and after starching all her clothes spread the things on boards to dry in the sun instead of ironing them as they do in England.In the evening the old man came home. As usual on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him ruffling out her feathers to show her joy and at last coming to rest on his shoulder. But tonight the old man was very disappointed for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen.He quickened his steps hastily drew off his straw sandals and stepped on to the veranda. Still no sparrow was to be seen. He now felt sure that his wife in one of her cross tempers had shut the sparrow up in its cage. So he called her and said anxiouslyWhere is Suzume San Miss Sparrow todayThe old woman pretended not to know at first and answeredYour sparrow I am sure I dont know. Now I come to think of it I havent seen her all the afternoon. I shouldnt wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your pettingBut at last when the old man gave her no peace but asked her again and again insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet she confessed all. She told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the ricepaste she had specially made for starching her clothes and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again.Then the old woman showed her husband the sparrows tongue sayingHere is the tongue I cut off Horrid little bird why did it eat all my starchHow could you be so cruel Oh how could you so cruel was all that the old man could answer. He was too kindhearted to punish his be shrew of a wife but he was terribly distressed at what had happened to his poor little sparrow.What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue he said to himself. She wont be able to chirp any more and surely the pain of the cutting of it out in that rough way must have made her ill Is there nothing to be doneThe old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep. While he wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe a bright thought comforted him he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow. Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.The next morning he rose early as soon as ever the day broke and snatching a hasty breakfast started out over the hills and through the woods stopping at every clump of bamboos to cryWhere oh where does my tonguecut sparrow stay Where oh where does my tonguecut sparrow stayHe never stopped to rest for his noonday meal and it was far on in the afternoon when he found himself near a large bamboo wood. Bamboo groves are the favorite haunts of sparrows and there sure enough at the edge of the wood he saw his own dear sparrow waiting to welcome him. He could hardly believe his eyes for joy and ran forward quickly to greet her. She bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her to show her pleasure at seeing her old friend again and wonderful to relate she could talk as of old. The old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened and inquired after her tongue wondering how she could speak so well without it. Then the sparrow opened her beak and showed him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one and begged him not to think any more about the past for she was quite well now. Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy and no common bird. It would be difficult to exaggerate the old mans rejoicing now. He forgot all his troubles he forgot even how tired he was for he had found his lost sparrow and instead of being ill and without a tongue as he had feared and expected to find her she was well and happy and with a new tongue and without a sign of the illtreatment she had received from his wife. And above all she was a fairy.The sparrow led the old man to the place of honor and then taking her place at a humble distance she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years.Then the Lady Sparrow as we will now call her introduced all her family to the old man. This done her daughters robed in dainty crape gowns brought in on beautiful oldfashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious foods till the old man began to think he must be dreaming. In the middle of the dinner some of the sparrows daughters performed a wonderful dance called the suzumeodori or the Sparrows dance to amuse the guest.Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much. The hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him.But the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home. He thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife. He told the Lady Sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing. It was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her. Now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart. If ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once.The Lady Sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change but the old man said he must return to his old wifewho would probably be cross at his not coming home at the usual timeand to his work and therefore much as he wished to do so he could not accept her kind invitation. But now that he knew where the Lady Sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time.When the Lady Sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer she gave an order to some of her servants and they at once brought in two boxes one large and the other small. These were placed before the old man and the Lady Sparrow asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present which she wished to give him.The old man could not refuse this kind proposal and he chose the smaller box sayingI am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box. As you are so kind as to say that I may take whichever I like I will choose the small one which will be easier for me to carry.Then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off bidding him goodby with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time. Thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily the sparrow showing not the least illwill for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife. Indeed she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life.When the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time.Where have you been all this time she asked in a big voice. Why do you come back so lateThe old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him and then he told her of all that had happened to him and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrows house.Now let us see what is in the box said the old man not giving her time to grumble again. You must help me open it. And they both sat down before the box and opened it.To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things. The mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again. The old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his. Beyond his brightest expectations was the sparrows gift which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days.He said Thanks to my good little sparrow Thanks to my good little sparrow many times.But the old woman after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the gold and silver were over could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature. She now began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents for in the innocence of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows had offered him preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home.You silly old man said she Why did you not bring the large box Just think what we have lost. We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this. You are certainly an old fool she screamed and then went to bed as angry as she could be.The old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box but it was too late the greedy old woman not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them and which she so little deserved made up her mind if possible to get more.Early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrows house. When he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going but it was useless. She would not listen to one word he said. It is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage. But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else. It did not even enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with heras indeed they wereand might punish her for what she had done.Ever since the Lady Sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found her weeping and bleeding from the mouth her whole family and relations had done little else but speak of the cruelty of the old woman. How could she they asked each other inflict such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some ricepaste by mistake They all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles but the old woman they hated and they determined if ever they had the chance to punish her as she deserved. They had not long to wait.After walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had made her husband carefully describe and now she stood before it crying outWhere is the tonguecut sparrows house Where is the tonguecut sparrows houseAt last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage. She hastened to the door and knocked loudly.When the servants told the Lady Sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see her she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit after all that had taken place and she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house. The Lady Sparrow however was a polite bird and so she went out to greet the old woman remembering that she had once been her mistress.The old woman intended however to waste no time in words she went right to the point without the least shame and saidYou need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man. I have come myself to get the box which he so stupidly left behind. I shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big boxthat is all I wantThe Lady Sparrow at once consented and told her servants to bring out the big box. The old woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back and without even stopping to thank the Lady Sparrow began to hurry homewards.The box was so heavy that she could not walk fast much less run as she would have liked to do so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box but she had often to sit down and rest herself by the way.While she was staggering along under the heavy load her desire to open the box became too great to be resisted. She could wait no longer for she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received.At last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth. What she saw however so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses. As soon as she lifted the lid a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her. Not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her muchcoveted box contained. A demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her a huge snake coiled and hissed about her and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her.The old woman had never been so frightened in her life and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her glad to escape alive. When she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box.Then she began to blame the sparrow but the old man stopped her at once sayingDont blame the sparrow it is your wickedness which has at last met with its reward. I only hope this may be a lesson to you in the futureThe old woman said nothing more and from that day she repented of her cross unkind ways and by degrees became a good old woman so that her husband hardly knew her to be the same person and they spent their last days together happily free from want or care spending carefully the treasure the old man had received from his pet the tonguecut sparrow.
Did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp It is not remarkably interesting but for once you may as well listen to it.It was a most respectable old lamp which had seen many many years of service and now was to retire with a pension. It was this very evening at its post for the last time giving light to the street. Its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret alone and forgotten.The lamp had very great anxiety about the next day for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council who were to decide whether it was fit for further service whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs or in the country at some factory. If the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down. In this latter case it might be turned into anything and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. This troubled it exceedingly.Whatever might happen it seemed certain that the lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife whose family it looked upon as its own. The lamp had first been hung up on the very evening that the watchman then a robust young man had entered upon the duties of his office. Ah well it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman. His wife had some little pride in those days she condescended to glance at the lamp only when she passed by in the eveningnever in the daytime. But in later years when all of themthe watchman the wife and the lamphad grown old she had attended to it cleaning it and keeping it supplied with oil. The old people were thoroughly honest they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it.This was the lamps last night in the street and tomorrow it must go to the town halltwo very dark things to think of. No wonder it did not burn brightly. How many persons it had lighted on their way and how much it had seen As much very likely as the mayor and corporation themselves None of these thoughts were uttered aloud however for the lamp was good and honorable and would not willingly do harm to any one especially to those in authority. As one thing after another was recalled to its mind the light would flash up with sudden brightness. At such moments the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered.There was a handsome young man once thought the lamp it is certainly a long while ago but I remember that he had a little note written on pink paper with a gold edge. The writing was elegant evidently a ladys. Twice he read it through and kissed it and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly I am the happiest of men Only he and I know what was written on this his first letter from his ladylove. Ah yes and there was another pair of eyes that I remember it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another A funeral passed through the street. A young and beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands of flowers and attended by torches which quite overpowered my light. All along the street stood the people from the houses in crowds ready to join the procession. But when the torches had passed from before me and I could look around I saw one person standing alone leaning against my post and weeping. Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me.These and similar reflections occupied the old street lamp on this the last time that its light would shine. The sentry when he is relieved from his post knows at least who will be his successor and may whisper a few words to him. But the lamp did not know its successor or it might have given him a few hints respecting rain or mist and might have informed him how far the moons rays would reach and from which side the wind generally blew and so on.On the bridge over the canal stood three persons who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp for they thought it could give the office to whomsoever it chose. The first was a herrings head which could emit light in the darkness. He remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamppost. Number two was a piece of rotten wood which also shines in the dark. He considered himself descended from an old stem once the pride of the forest. The third was a glowworm and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine yet there he was and could really give light as well as the others. But the rotten wood and the herrings head declared most solemnly by all they held sacred that the glowworm only gave light at certain times and must not be allowed to compete with them. The old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp but they would believe nothing that it said. When they discovered that it had not the power of naming its successor they said they were very glad to hear it for the lamp was too old and worn out to make a proper choice.At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of the street and through the airholes of the old lamp. What is this I hear it asked. Are you going away tomorrow Is this evening the last time we shall meet Then I must present you with a farewell gift. I will blow into your brain so that in future not only shall you be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the past but your light within shall be so bright that you will be able to understand all that is said or done in your presence.Oh that is really a very very great gift said the old lamp. I thank you most heartily. I only hope I shall not be melted down.That is not likely to happen yet said the wind. I will also blow a memory into you so that should you receive other similar presents your old age will pass very pleasantly.That is if I am not melted down said the lamp. But should I in that case still retain my memoryDo be reasonable old lamp said the wind puffing away.At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. What will you give the old lamp asked the wind.I can give nothing she replied. I am on the wane and no lamps have ever given me light while I have frequently shone upon them. With these words the moon hid herself again behind the clouds that she might be saved from further importunities. Just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts. I shall penetrate you so thoroughly it said that you will have the power of becoming rusty and if you wish it can crumble into dust in one night.But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present and the wind thought so too. Does no one give any more Will no one give any more shouted the breath of the wind as loud as it could. Then a bright falling star came down leaving a broad luminous streak behind it.What was that cried the herrings head. Did not a star fall I really believe it went into the lamp. Certainly when such highborn personages try for the office we may as well go home.And so they did all three while the old lamp threw a wonderfully strong light all around.This is a glorious gift it said. The bright stars have always been a joy to me and have always shone more brilliantly than I ever could shine though I have tried with my whole might. Now they have noticed me a poor old lamp and have sent me a gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember as if it still stood before me and to let it be seen by all those who love me. And herein lies the truest happiness for pleasures which we cannot share with others are only half enjoyed.That sentiment does you honor said the wind but for this purpose wax lights will be necessary. If these are not lighted in you your peculiar faculties will not benefit others in the least. The stars have not thought of this. They suppose that you and every other light must be a wax taper. But I must go down now. So it laid itself to rest.Wax tapers indeed said the lamp I have never yet had these nor is it likely I ever shall. If I could only be sure of not being melted downThe next daywell perhaps we had better pass over the next day. The evening had come and the lamp was resting in a grandfathers chair and guess where Why at the old watchmans house. He had begged as a favor that the mayor and corporation would allow him to keep the street lamp in consideration of his long and faithful service as he had himself hung it up and lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties four and twenty years ago. He looked upon it almost as his own child. He had no children so the lamp was given to him.There lay the lamp in the great armchair near the warm stove. It seemed almost to have grown larger for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The old people sat at their supper casting friendly glances at it and would willingly have admitted it to a place at the table. It is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room. But within it was warm and comfortable and strips of list had been nailed round the door. The bed and the little window had curtains and everything looked clean and neat. On the window seat stood two curious flowerpots which a sailor named Christian had brought from the East or West Indies. They were of clay and in the form of two elephants with open backs they were filled with earth and through the open space flowers bloomed. In one grew some very fine chives or leeks this was the kitchen garden. The other which contained a beautiful geranium they called their flower garden. On the wall hung a large colored print representing the Congress of Vienna and all the kings and emperors. A clock with heavy weights hung on the wall and went tick tick steadily enough yet it was always rather too fast which however the old people said was better than being too slow. They were now eating their supper while the old street lamp as we have heard lay in the grandfathers armchair near the stove.It seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round. But after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through togetherin rain and in fog during the short bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt that all was well again. It saw everything that had happened quite clearly as if the events were passing before it. Surely the wind had given it an excellent giftThe old people were very active and industrious they were never idle for even a single hour. On Sunday afternoons they would bring out some books generally a book of travels which they greatly liked. The old man would read aloud about Africa with its great forests and the wild elephants while his wife would listen attentively stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants which served as flowerpots. I can almost imagine I am seeing it all she said.Ah how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in it for then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it did itself the lofty trees with their thickly entwined branches the naked negroes on horseback and whole herds of elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad heavy feet.What is the use of all my capabilities sighed the old lamp when I cannot obtain any wax lights They have only oil and tallow here and these will not do. One day a great heap of waxcandle ends found their way into the cellar. The larger pieces were burned and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread. So there were now candles enough but it never occurred to any one to put a little piece in the lamp.Here I am now with my rare powers thought the lamp. I have faculties within me but I cannot share them. They do not know that I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry or change them into noble forests or indeed to anything else they might wish.The lamp however was always kept clean and shining in a corner where it attracted all eyes. Strangers looked upon it as lumber but the old people did not care for that they loved it. One dayit was the watchmans birthdaythe old woman approached the lamp smiling to herself and said I will have an illumination today in honor of my old man. The lamp rattled in its metal frame for it thought Now at last I shall have a light within me. But after all no wax light was placed in the lamponly oil as usual.The lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life. Then it had a dream for to one with its faculties dreaming was not difficult. It dreamed that the old people were dead and that it had been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down. This caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall. But though it had been endowed with the power of falling into decay from rust when it pleased it did not make use of this power. It was therefore put into the melting furnace and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish to seeone intended to hold a wax taper. The candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a nosegay in the center of which the wax taper was to be placed. It was to stand on a green writing table in a very pleasant room where there were many books scattered about and splendid paintings on the walls.The owner of the room was a poet and a man of intellect. Everything he thought or wrote was pictured around him. Nature showed herself to him sometimes in the dark forests sometimes in cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting about or on the deck of a ship sailing across the foaming sea with the clear blue sky above or at night in the glittering stars.What powers I possess said the lamp awaking from its dream. I could almost wish to be melted down but no that must not be while the old people live. They love me for myself alone they keep me bright and supply me with oil. I am as well off as the picture of the Congress in which they take so much pleasure. And from that time it felt at rest in itself and not more so than such an honorable old lamp really deserved to be.
There was once a king who took great delight in hunting. One day he followed a stag a great distance into the forest. He went on and on until he lost his way. Night fell and the king by happy chance came upon a clearing where a charcoalburner had a cottage. The king asked the charcoalburner to lead him out of the forest and offered to pay him handsomely.Id be glad to go with you the charcoalburner said but my wife is expecting the birth of a child and I cannot leave her. It is too late for you to start out alone. Wont you spend the night here Lie down on some hay in the garret and tomorrow Ill be your guide.The king had to accept this arrangement. He climbed into the garret and lay down on the floor. Soon afterwards a son was born to the charcoalburner.At midnight the king noticed a strange light in the room below him. He peeped through a chink in the boards and saw the charcoalburner asleep his wife lying in a dead faint and three old women all in white standing over the baby each holding a lighted taper in her hand.The first old woman said My gift to this boy is that he shall encounter great dangers.The second said My gift to him is that he shall go safely through them all and live long.The third one said And I give him for wife the baby daughter born this night to the king who lies upstairs on the straw.The three old women blew out their tapers and all was quiet. They were the Fates.The king felt as though a sword had been thrust into his heart. He lay awake till morning trying to think out some plan by which he could thwart the will of the three old Fates.When day broke the child began to cry and the charcoalburner woke up. Then he saw that his wife had died during the night.Ah my poor motherless child he cried what shall I do with you nowGive me the baby the king said. Ill see that hes looked after properly and Ill give you enough money to keep you the rest of your life.The charcoalburner was delighted with this offer and the king went away promising to send at once for the baby.A few days later when he reached his palace he was met with the joyful news that a beautiful little baby daughter had been born to him. He asked the time of her birth and of course it was on the very night when he saw the Fates. Instead of being pleased at the safe arrival of the baby princess the king frowned.Then he called one of his stewards and said to him Go into the forest in a direction that I shall tell you. You will find there a cottage where a charcoalburner lives. Give him this money and get from him a little child. Take the child and on your way back drown it. Do as I say or I shall have you drowned.The steward went found the charcoalburner and took the child. He put it into a basket and carried it away. As he was crossing a broad river he dropped the basket into the water.Goodnight to you little soninlaw that nobody wanted the king said when he heard what the steward had done.He supposed of course that the baby was drowned. But it wasnt. Its little basket floated in the water like a cradle and the baby slept as if the river were singing it a lullaby. It floated down with the current past a fishermans cottage. The fisherman saw it got into his boat and went after it. When he found what the basket contained he was overjoyed. At once he carried the baby to his wife and saidYou have always wanted a little son and here you have one. The river has given him to us.The fishermans wife was delighted and brought up the child as her own. They named him Plavachek which means a little boy who has come floating on the water.The river flowed on and the days went by and Plavachek grew from a baby to a boy and then into a handsome youth the handsomest by far in the whole countryside.One day the king happened to ride that way unattended. It was hot and he was thirsty. He beckoned to the fisherman to get him a drink of fresh water. Plavachek brought it to him. The king looked at the handsome youth in astonishment.You have a fine lad he said to the fisherman. Is he your own sonHe is yet he isnt the fisherman answered. Just twenty years ago a little baby in a basket floated down the river. We took him in and he has been ours ever since.A mist rose before the kings eyes and he went deathly pale for he knew at once that Plavachek was the child that he had ordered drowned.Soon he recovered himself and jumping from his horse he said I need a messenger to send to my palace and I have no one with me. Could this youth go for meYour majesty has but to command the fisherman said and Plavachek will go.The king sat down and wrote a letter to the queen. This is what he saidHave the young man who delivers this letter run through with a sword at once. He is a dangerous enemy. Let him be dispatched before I return. Such is my will.He folded the letter made it secure and sealed it with his own signet.Plavachek took the letter and started out with it at once. He had to go through a deep forest where he missed the path and lost his way. He struggled on through underbrush and thicket until it began to grow dark. Then he met an old woman who said to himWhere are you going PlavachekIm carrying this letter to the kings palace and Ive lost my way. Can you put me on the right road motherYou cant get there today the old woman said. Its dark now. Spend the night with me. You wont be with a stranger for Im your old godmother.Plavachek allowed himself to be persuaded and presently he saw before him a pretty little house that seemed at that moment to have sprung out of the ground.During the night while Plavachek was asleep the old woman took the letter out of his pocket and put in another that read as followsHave the young man who delivers this letter married to our daughter at once. He is my destined soninlaw. Let the wedding take place before I return. Such is my will.The next day Plavachek delivered the letter and as soon as the queen read it she gave orders at once for the wedding. Both she and her daughter were much taken with the handsome youth and gazed at him with tender eyes. As for Plavachek he fell instantly in love with the princess and was delighted to marry her.Some days after the wedding the king returned and when he heard what had happened he flew into a violent rage at the queen.But protested the queen you yourself ordered me to have him married to our daughter before you came back. Here is your letter.The king took the letter and examined it carefully. The handwriting the seal the paperall were his own.He called his soninlaw and questioned him.Plavachek related how he had lost his way in the forest and spent the night with his godmother.What does your godmother look like the king asked.Plavachek described her.From the description the king recognized her as the same old woman who had promised the princess to the charcoalburners son twenty years before.He looked at Plavachek thoughtfully and at last he saidWhats done cant be undone. However young man you cant expect to be my soninlaw for nothing. If you want my daughter you must bring me for dowry three of the golden hairs of old Grandfather Knowitall.He thought to himself that this would be an impossible task and so would be a good way to get rid of an undesirable soninlaw.Plavachek took leave of his bride and started off. He didnt know which way to go. Who would know Everybody talked about old Grandfather Knowitall but nobody seemed to know where to find him. Yet Plavachek had a Fate for a godmother so it wasnt likely that he would miss the right road.He traveled long and far going over wooded hills and desert plains and crossing deep rivers. He came at last to a black sea.There he saw a boat and an old ferryman.God bless you old ferryman he said.May God grant that prayer young traveler Where are you goingIm going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get three of his golden hairs.Oho I have long been hunting for just such a messenger as you For twenty years I have been ferrying people across this black sea and nobody has come to relieve me. If you promise to ask Grandfather Knowitall when my work will end Ill ferry you over.Plavachek promised and the boatman took him across.Plavachek traveled on until he came to a great city that was in a state of decay. Before the city he met an old man who had a staff in his hand but even with the staff he could scarcely crawl along.God bless you old grandfather Plavachek said.May God grant that prayer handsome youth Where are you goingI am going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get three of his golden hairs.Indeed We have been waiting a long time for just such a messenger as you I must lead you at once to the king.So he took him to the king and the king said Ah so you are going on an errand to Grandfather Knowitall We have an appletree here that used to bear apples of youth. If any one ate one of those apples no matter how aged he was hed become young again. But alas for twenty years now our tree has borne no fruit. If you promise to ask Grandfather Knowitall if there is any help for us I will reward you handsomely.Plavachek gave the king his promise and the king bid him godspeed.Plavachek traveled on until he reached another great city that was half in ruins. Not far from the city a man was burying his father and tears as big as peas were rolling down his cheek.God bless you mournful gravedigger Plavachek said.May God grant that prayer kind traveler Where are you goingIm going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get three of his golden hairs.To Grandfather Knowitall What a pity you didnt come sooner Our king has long been waiting for just such a messenger as you I must lead you to him.So he took Plavachek to the king and the king said to him So youre going on an errand to Grandfather Knowitall. We have a well here that used to flow with the water of life. If any one drank of it no matter how sick he was he would get well. Nay if he were already dead this water sprinkled upon him would bring him back to life. But alas for twenty years now the well has gone dry. If you promise to ask Grandfather Knowitall if there is help for us I will reward you handsomely.Plavachek gave the king his promise and the king bid him godspeed.After that Plavachek traveled long and far into a black forest. Deep in the forest he came upon a broad green meadow full of beautiful flowers and in its midst a golden palace glittering as though it were on fire. This was the palace of Grandfather Knowitall.Plavachek entered and found nobody there but an old woman who sat spinning in a corner.Welcome Plavachek she said. I am delighted to see you again.He looked at the old woman and saw that she was his godmother with whom he had spent the night when he was carrying the letter to the palace.What has brought you here Plavachek she asked.The king godmother. He says I cant be his soninlaw for nothing. I have to give a dowry. So he has sent me to old Grandfather Knowitall to get three of his golden hairs.The old woman smiled and said Do you know who Grandfather Knowitall is Why hes the bright Sun who goes everywhere and sees everything. I am his mother. In the morning hes a little lad at noon hes a grown man and in the evening an old grandfather. I will get you three of the golden hairs from his golden head for I must not be a godmother for nothing But my lad you mustnt remain where you are. My son is kind but if he comes home hungry he might want to roast you and eat you for his supper. Theres an empty tub over there and Ill just cover you with it.Plavachek begged his godmother to get from Grandfather Knowitall the answers for the three questions he had promised to ask.I will said the old woman and do you listen carefully to what he says.Suddenly there was the rushing sound of a mighty wind outside and the Sun an old grandfather with a golden head flew in by the western window. He sniffed the air suspiciously.Phew Phew he cried. I smell human flesh Have you any one here motherStar of the day whom could I have here without your seeing him The truth is youve been flying all day long over Gods world and your nose is filled with the smell of human flesh. Thats why you still smell it when you come home in the evening.The old man said nothing more and sat down to his supper.After supper he laid his head on the old womans lap and fell sound asleep. The old woman pulled out a golden hair and threw it on the floor. It twanged like the string of a violin.What is it mother the old man said. What is itNothing my boy nothing. I was asleep and had a wonderful dream.What did you dream about motherI dreamt about a city where they had a well of living water. If any one drank of it no matter how sick he was he would get well. Nay if he were already dead this water sprinkled on him would bring him back to life. For the last twenty years the well has gone dry. Is there anything to be done to make it flow againYes. Theres a frog sitting on the spring that feeds the well. Let them kill the frog and clean out the well and the water will flow as before.When he fell asleep again the old woman pulled out another golden hair and threw it on the floor.What is it motherNothing my boy nothing. I was asleep again and I had a wonderful dream. I dreamt of a city where they had an appletree that bore apples of youth. If any one ate one of those apples no matter how aged he was hed become young again. But for twenty years the tree has borne no fruit. Can anything be done about itYes. In the roots of the tree there is a snake that takes its strength. Let them kill the snake and transplant the tree. Then it will bear fruit as before.He fell asleep again and the old woman pulled out a third golden hair.Why wont you let me sleep mother he complained and started to sit up.Lie still my boy lie still. I didnt intend to wake you but a heavy sleep fell upon me and I had another wonderful dream. I dreamt of a boatman on the black sea. For twenty years he has been ferrying that boat and no one has offered to relieve him. When will he be relievedAh but that boatman is the son of a stupid mother Why doesnt he thrust the oar into the hand of some one else and jump ashore himself Then the other man would have to be ferryman in his place. But now let me be quiet. I must get up early tomorrow morning and go and dry the tears which the kings daughter sheds every night for her husband the charcoalburners son whom the king has sent to get three of my golden hairs.In the morning there was again the rushing sound of a mighty wind outside and a beautiful golden childno longer an old manawoke on his mothers lap. It was the glorious Sun. He bade his mother farewell and flew out by an eastern window.The old woman turned over the tub and said to Plavachek Here are the three golden hairs for you. You also have Grandfather Knowitalls answers to your three questions. Now goodby. As you will need me no more you will never see me again.Plavachek thanked his godmother most gratefully and departed.When he reached the first city the king asked him what news he brought.Good news Plavachek said. Have the well cleaned out and kill the frog that sits on its spring. If you do this the water will flow again as it used to.The king ordered this to be done at once and when he saw the water beginning to bubble up and flow again he made Plavachek a present of twelve horses white as swans laden with as much gold and silver as they could carry.When Plavachek came to the second city and the king of that city asked him what news he brought he saidGood news Have the apple tree dug up. At its roots you will find a snake. Kill the snake and replant the tree. Then it will bear fruit as it used to.The king had this done at once and during the night the tree burst into bloom and bore great quantities of fruit. The king was delighted and made Plavachek a present of twelve horses black as ravens laden with as much riches as they could carry.Plavachek traveled on and when he came to the black sea the boatman asked him had he the answer to his question.Yes I have said Plavachek but you must ferry me over before I tell you.The boatman wanted to hear the answer at once but Plavachek was firm. So the old man ferried him across with his twelve white horses and his twelve black horses.When Plavachek was safely landed he said The next person who comes to be ferried over thrust the oar into his hand and do you jump ashore. Then the other man will have to be boatman in your place.Plavachek traveled home to the palace. The king could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the three golden hairs of Grandfather Knowitall. The princess wept again not for sorrow this time but for joy at her bridegrooms return.But Plavachek the king gasped where did you get these beautiful horses and all these richesI earned them said Plavachek proudly. Then he related how he helped one king who had a tree of the apples of youth and another king who had a well of the water of life.Apples of youth Water of life the king kept repeating softly to himself. If I ate one of those apples I should become young again If I were dead the water of life would restore meHe lost no time in starting out in quest of the apples of youth and the water of life. And do you know he hasnt come back yetSo Plavachek the charcoalburners son became the kings soninlaw as the old Fate foretold.As for the king well I fear hes still ferrying that boat across the black sea
Once upon a time and a very good time it was though it was neither in my time nor in your time nor in any one elses time there was an old man and an old woman and they had one son and they lived in a great forest. And their son never saw any other people in his life but he knew that there was some more in the world besides his own father and mother because he had lots of books and he used to read every day about them. And when he read about some pretty young women he used to go mad to see some of them till one day when his father was out cutting wood he told his mother that he wished to go away to look for his living in some other country and to see some other people besides them two. And he said I see nothing at all here but great trees around me and if I stay here maybe I shall go mad before I see anything. The young mans father was out all this time when this talk was going on between him and his poor old mother.The old woman begins by saying to her son before leaving Well well my poor boy if you want to go its better for you to go and God be with you.The old woman thought for the best when she said that. But stop a bit before you go. Which would you like best for me to make you a little cake and bless you or a big cake and curse you Dear dear said he make me a big cake. Maybe I shall be hungry on the road. The old woman made the big cake and she went on top of the house and she cursed him as far as she could see him.He presently meets with his father and the old man says to him Where are you going my poor boy when the son told the father the same tale as he told his mother. Well says his father Im sorry to see you going away but if youve made your mind to go its better for you to go.The poor lad had not gone far when his father called him back then the old man drew out of his pocket a golden snuffbox and said to him Here take this little box and put it in your pocket and be sure not to open it till you are near your death. And away went poor Jack upon his road and walked till he was tired and hungry for he had eaten all his cake upon the road and by this time night was upon him so he could hardly see his way before him. He could see some light a long way before him and he made up to it and found the back door and knocked at it till one of the maidservants came and asked him what he wanted. He said that night was on him and he wanted to get some place to sleep. The maidservant called him in to the fire and gave him plenty to eat good meat and bread and beer and as he was eating his food by the fire there came the young lady to look at him and she loved him well and he loved her. And the young lady ran to tell her father and said there was a pretty young man in the back kitchen and immediately the gentleman came to him and questioned him and asked what work he could do. Jack said the silly fellow that he could do anything. He meant that he could do any foolish bit of work that would be wanted about the house.Well says the gentleman to him if you can do anything at eight oclock in the morning I must have a great lake and some ofthe largest manofwar vessels sailing before my mansion and one of the largest vessels must fire a royal salute and the last round must break the leg of the bed where my young daughter is sleeping. And if you dont do that you will have to forfeit your life.All right said Jack and away he went to his bed and said his prayers quietly and slept till it was near eight oclock and he had hardly any time to think what he was to do till all of a sudden he remembered about the little golden box that his father gave him. And he said to himself Well well I never was so near my death as I am now and then he felt in his pocket and drew the little box out. And when he opened it out there hopped three little red men and asked Jack What is your will with us Well said Jack I want a great lake and some of the largest manofwar vessels in the world before this mansion and one of the largest vessels to fire a royal salute and the last round to break one of the legs of the bed where this young lady is sleeping. All right said the little men go to sleep.Jack had hardly time to bring the words out of his mouth to tell the little men what to do but what it struck eight oclock when Bang bang went one of the largest manofwar vessels and it made Jack jump out of bed to look through the window and I can assure you it was a wonderful sight for him to see after being so long with his father and mother living in a wood.By this time Jack dressed himself and said his prayers and came down laughing for he was proud he was because the thing was done so well. The gentleman comes to him and says to him Well my young man I must say that you are very clever indeed. Come and have some breakfast. And the gentleman tells him Now there are two more things you have to do and then you shall have my daughter in marriage. Jack gets his breakfast and has a good squint at the young lady and also she at him.The other thing that the gentleman told him to do was to fell all the great trees for miles around by eight oclock in the morning and to make my long story short it was done and it pleased the gentleman well The gentleman said to him The other thing you have to doand it was the last thingyou must get me a great castle standing on twelve golden pillars and there must come regiments of soldiers and go through their drill. At eight oclock the commanding officer must say Shoulder up. All right said Jack when the third and last morning came the third great feat was finished and he had the young daughter in marriage. But oh dear there is worse to come yet.The gentleman now makes a large hunting party and invites all the gentlemen around the country to it and to see the castle as well. And by this time Jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with them. On that morning his valet when putting Jacks clothes by after changing them to go a hunting put his hand in one of Jacks waistcoatpockets and pulled out the little golden snuffbox as poor Jack left behind in a mistake. And that man opened the little box and there hopped the three little red men out and asked him what he wanted with them. Well said the valet to them I want this castle to be moved from this place far and far across the sea. All right said the little red men to him do you wish to go with it Yes said he. Well get up said they to him and away they went far and far over the great sea.Now the grand hunting party comes back and the castle upon the twelve golden pillars had disappeared to the great disappointment of those gentlemen as did not see it before. That poor silly Jack is threatened by taking his beautiful young wife from him for taking them in in the way he did. But the gentleman at last made an agreement with him and he is to have a twelvemonths and a day to look for it and off he goes with a good horse and money in his pocket.Now poor Jack goes in search of his missing castle over hills dales valleys and mountains through woolly woods and sheepwalks further than I can tell you or ever intend to tell you. Until at last he comes up to the place where lives the King of all the little mice in the world. There was one of the little mice on sentry at the front gate going up to the palace and did try to stop Jack from going in. He asked the little mouse Where does the King live I should like to see him. This one sent another with him to show him the place and when the King saw him he called him in. And the King questioned him and asked him where he was going that way. Well Jack told him all the truth that he had lost the great castle and was going to look for it and he had a whole twelvemonths and a day to find it out. And Jack asked him whether he knew anything about it and the King said No but I am the King of all the little mice in the world and I will call them all up in the morning and maybe they have seen something of it.Then Jack got a good meal and bed and in the morning he and the King went on to the fields and the King called all the mice together and asked them whether they had seen the great beautiful castle standing on golden pillars. And all the little mice said No there was none of them had seen it. The old King said to him that he had two other brothers One is the King of all the frogs and my other brother who is the oldest he is the King of all the birds in the world. And if you go there may be they know something about the missing castle. The King said to him Leave your horse here with me till you come back and take one of my best horses under you and give this cake to my brother he will know then who you got it from. Mind and tell him I am well and should like dearly to see him. And then the King and Jack shook hands together.And when Jack was going through the gates the little mouse asked him should he go with him and Jack said to him No I shall get myself into trouble with the King. And the little thing told him It will be better for you to let me go with you maybe I shall do some good to you some time without you knowing it. Jump up then. And the little mouse ran up the horses leg and made it dance and Jack put the mouse in his pocket.Now Jack after wishing good morning to the King and pocketing the little mouse which was on sentry trudged on his way and such a long way he had to go and this was his first day. At last he found the place and there was one of the frogs on sentry and gun upon his shoulder and did try to hinder Jack from going in but when Jack said to him that he wanted to see the King he allowed him to pass and Jack made up to the door. The King came out and asked him his business and Jack told him all from beginning to end. Well well come in. He gets good entertainment that night and in the morning the King made such a funny sound and collected all the frogs in the world. And he asked them did they know or see anything of a castle that stood upon twelve golden pillars and they all made a curious sound Krokro krokro and said No.Jack had to take another horse and a cake to this Kings brother who is the King of all the fowls of the air and as Jack was going through the gates the little frog that was on sentry asked John should he go with him. Jack refused him for a bit but at last he told him to jump up and Jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket. And away he went again on his great long journey it was three times as long this time as it was the first day however he found the place and there was a fine bird on sentry. And Jack passed him and he never said a word to him and he talked with the King and told him everything all about the castle. Well said the King to him you shall know in the morning from my birds whether they know anything or not. Jack put up his horse in the stable and then went to bed after having something to eat. And when he got up in the morning the King and he went on to some field and there the King made some funny noise and there came all the fowls that were in all the world. And the King asked them Did they see the fine castle and all the birds answered No. Well said the King where is the great bird They had to wait then for a long time for the eagle to make his appearance when at last he came all in a perspiration after sending two little birds high up in the sky to whistle on him to make all the haste he possibly could. The King asked the great bird Did he see the great castle and the bird said Yes I came from there where it now is. Well says the King to him this young gentleman has lost it and you must go with him back to it but stop till you get a bit of something to eat first.They killed a thief and sent the best part of it to feed the eagle on his journey over the seas and had to carry Jack on his back. Now when they came in sight of the castle they did not know what to do to get the little golden box. Well the little mouse said to them Leave me down and I will get the little box for you. So the mouse stole into the castle and got hold of the box and when he was coming down the stairs it fell down and he was very near being caught. He came running out with it laughing his best. Have you got it Jack said to him he said Yes and off they went back again and left the castle behind.As they were all of them Jack mouse frog and eagle passing over the great sea they fell to quarrelling about which it was that got the little box till down it slipped into the water. It was by them looking at it and handing it from one hand to the other that they dropped the little box to the bottom of the sea. Well well said the frog I knew that I would have to do something so you had better let me go down in the water. And they let him go and he was down for three days and three nights and up he comes and shows his nose and little mouth out of the water and all of them asked him Did he get it and he told them No. Well what are you doing there then Nothing at all he said only I want my full breath and the poor little frog went down the second time and he was down for a day and a night and up he brings it.And away they did go after being there four days and nights and after a long tug over seas and mountains arrive at the palace of the old King who is the master of all the birds in the world. And the King is very proud to see them and has a hearty welcome and a long conversation. Jack opens the little box and told the little men to go back and to bring the castle here to them and all of you make as much haste back again as you possibly can.The castle flew away with the greatest speed. Illustrator unknown published in Fairy Tales of All Nations by Logan Marshall 1910 John C. Winston Company.The three little men went off and when they came near the castle they were afraid to go to it till the gentleman and lady and all the servants were gone out to some dance. And there was no one left behind there only the cook and another maid with her and the little red men asked them which would they rathergo or stop behind and they both said I will go with you and the little men told them to run upstairs quick. They were no sooner up and in one of the drawingrooms than here comes just in sight the gentleman and lady and all the servants but it was too late. Off the castle went at full speed with the women laughing at them through the window while they made motions for them to stop but all to no purpose.They were nine days on their journey in which they did try to keep the Sunday holy when one of the little men turned to be the priest the other the clerk and third presided at the organ and the women were the singers for they had a grand chapel in the castle already. Very remarkable there was a discord made in the music and one of the little men ran up one of the organpipes to see where the bad sound came from when he found out it only happened to be that the two women were laughing at the little red man stretching his little legs full length on the bass pipes also his two arms the same time with his little red nightcap which he never forgot to wear and what they never witnessed before could not help calling forth some good merriment while on the face of the deep. And poor thing through them not going on with what they begun with they very near came to danger as the castle was once very near sinking in the middle of the sea.At length after a merry journey they come again to Jack and the King. The King was quite struck with the sight of the castle and going up the golden stairs went to see the inside.The King was very much pleased with the castle but poor Jacks time of a twelvemonths and a day was drawing to a close and he wishing to go home to his young wife gives orders to the three little men to get ready by the next morning at eight oclock to be off to the next brother and to stop there for one night also to proceed from there to the last or the youngest brother the master of all the mice in the world in such place where the castle shall be left under his care until its sent for. Jack takes a farewell of the King and thanks him very much for his hospitality.Away went Jack and his castle again and stopped one night in that place and away they went again to the third place and there left the castle under his care. As Jack had to leave the castle behind he had to take to his own horse which he left there when he first started.Now poor Jack leaves his castle behind and faces towards home and after having so much merriment with the three brothers every night Jack became sleepy on horseback and would have lost the road if it was not for the little men aguiding him. At last he arrived weary and tired and they did not seem to receive him with any kindness whatever because he had not found the stolen castle and to make it worse he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents. But that did not stop long. Jack put full power on and despatched the little men off to bring the castle from there and they soon got there.Jack shook hands with the King and returned many thanks for his kingly kindness in minding the castle for him and then Jack instructed the little men to spur up and put speed on. And off they went and were not long before they reached their journeys end when out comes the young wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young SON and they all lived happy ever afterwards.
Blixie Bimbers mother was chopping hash. And the hatchet broke. So Blixie started downtown with fifteen cents to buy a new hash hatchet for chopping hash. Downtown she peeped around the corner next nearest the post office where the Potato Face Blind Man sat with his accordion. And the old man had his legs crossed one foot on the sidewalk the other foot up in the air.The foot up in the air had a green rat sitting on it tying the old mans shoestrings in knots and double knots. Whenever the old mans foot wiggled and wriggled the green rat wiggled and wriggled. The tail of the rat wrapped five wraps around the shoe and then fastened and tied like a package. On the back of the green rat was a long white swipe from the end of the nose to the end of the tail. Two little white swipes stuck up over the eyelashes. And five short thick swipes of white played pussywantsacorner back of the ears and along the ribs of the green rat. They were talking the old man and the green rat talking about alligators and why the alligators keep their baby shoes locked up in trunks over the winter timeand why the rats in the moon lock their mittens in ice boxes.I had the rheumatism last summer a year ago. I had the rheumatism so bad I ran a thousand miles south and west till I came to the Egg Towns and stopped in the Village of Eggs Up.So quizzed the Potato Face. There in the Village of Eggs Up they asked me Do you know how to stop the moon moving I answered them Tes I know howa baby alligator told mebut I told the baby alligator I wouldnt tell. Many years ago there in that Village of Eggs Up they started making a skyscraper to go up till it reached the moon. They said We will step in the elevator and go up to the roof and sit on the roof and eat supper on the moon. The bricklayers and the mortar men and the iron riveters and the wheelbarrowers and the plasterers went higher and higher making that skyscraper till at last they were half way up to the moon saying to each other while they  and worked We will step in the elevator and go up to the roof and sit on the roof and eat supper on the moon. Yes they were halfway up to the moon. And that night looking at the moon they saw it move and they said to each other We must stop the moon moving and they said later We dont know how to stop the moon moving. And the bricklayers and the mortar men and the iron riveters and the wheelbarrowers and the plasterers said to each other If we go on now and make this skyscraper it will miss the moon and we will never go up in the elevator and sit on the roof and eat supper on the moon.So they took the skyscraper down and started making it over again aiming it straight at the moon again. And one night standing looking at the moon they saw it move and they said to each other We must stop the moon moving saying later to each other We dont know how to stop the moon moving.And now they stand in the streets at night there in the Village of Eggs Up stretching their necks looking at the moon and asking each other Why does the moon move and how can we stop the moon movingWhenever I saw them standing there stretching their necks looking at the moon I had a zigzag ache in my left hind foot and I wanted to tell them what the baby alligator told me the secret of how to stop the moon moving. One night that ache zigzagged me soway inside my left hind footit zig zagged so I ran home here a thousand miles.The Potato Face Blind Man wriggled his shoeand the green rat wriggledand the long white swipe from the end of the nose to the end of the tail of the green rat wriggled. Is your rheumatism better the old man asked.The rat answered Any rheumatism is better if you run a thousand miles twice.And Blixie Bimber going home with the fifteen cent hash hatchet for her mother to chop hash Blixie said to herself It is a large morning to be thoughtful about.
In a certain village there lived with his wife a poor gardener who cultivated greens in a small patch in the backyard of his house. They were in thirty little beds half of which he would water every day. This occupied him from the fifth to the fifteenth ghaik.His wife used to cut a basketful of greens every evening and he took them in the mornings to sell in the village. The sale brought him a measure or two of rice and on this the family lived If he could manage any extra work of an evening he got a few coppers which served to meet their other expenses.Now in that village there was a temple to Kl before which was a fine tank with a mango tree on its bank. The fish in the tank and the mangoes from the tree were dedicated to the goddess and were strictly forbidden to the villagers. If any one was discovered cutting a mango or catching a fish he was at once excommunicated from the village. So strict was the prohibition.The gardener was returning home one morning after selling his greens and passed the temple. The mangoes so carefully guarded by religious protection were hanging on the tree in great numbers and the gardeners eyes fell on them His mouth watered. He looked round about him and fortunately there was no one by at least as far as his eyes could reach. So he hastily plucked one of the mangoes and with nimble feet descended into the tank to wash it. Just then a most charming shoal of fish met his eyes. These protected dwellers in the tank had no notion of danger and so were frolicking about at their ease. The gardener looked about him first and finding no one by caught half a dozen stout fish at one plunge of his hand. He hid them and the mango underneath the rice in his basket and returned home happy in the thought that he had not been caught. Now he had a special delight in fish and when he reached his house he showed what he brought to his wife and asked her to prepare a dish with the newly caught fish and the nevertillthen tasted mango.Meanwhile he had to water his garden and went to the backyard for the purpose. The watering was done by a pika. He used to run up and down the pole while a friend of his the son of his neighbour lifted the water and irrigated the garden.Meanwhile his wife cooked the dish of mango and fish in a pan and found the flavour so sweet that even while the fish was only half cooked she began to taste one bit of it after another till more than half had already gone down her throat The dish was at last cooked and the few remaining slices in the pan were taken off the fire so she went into the verandah and from thence saw her husband running up and down the pika. She beckoned to him that the dish was ready and that he should come in and taste it. However he never noticed her but kept on running up and down the pika and while running up and down he was obliged to wave his hands about and this his wife mistook as an indication that she might eat up her portion of the dish. At any rate her imagination made her think so and she went in and ate a slice and then went out into the verandah again to call her husband who was still running up and down the pika. Again her husband so she thought waved his hands in permission to go on with her dinner. Again she went in and had another slice. Thus it went on for a full ghaik till the last slice was consumed.Alas thought she With what great eagerness my husband fetched the fish and the mango and how sadly out of greediness have I disappointed him. Surely his anger will know no bounds when he comes in. I must soon devise some means to save myself.So she brought the pan in which she cooked the fish and mango out of the house and covered it with another pan of similar size and sat down before it. Then she undid her hair and twisted it about her head until it was dishevelled. She then began to make a great noise. This action by a woman in an illiterate family of low caste is always supposed to indicate a visitation from a goddess and a demon so when her husband from the pika tree saw the state of his wife his guilty conscience smote him. The change in his wife alarmed him and he came down suddenly and stood before her. As soon as she saw him she roared out at himWhy have you injured me today by plundering my mango and fish How dare you do such an irreligious act You shall soon see the results of your impertinenceThe goddess has come upon my wife most terribly thought the poor man. Her divine power may soon kill her What shall I doSo he fell at the feet of the divine visitation as he thought it to be and saidMy most holy goddess your dog of a servant has this day deviated from the straight path. Excuse him this time and he will never do so a second time.Run then with the pan which contains the fruits of your robbery and dip it deep into my tank. Then shall the fish become alive and the mango shall take its place in the tree.The gardener received the order most submissively and taking the pan in his hand flew to the tank. There he dipped it in the water and came back to his house fully believing that his sin that day had been forgiven and that the cooked fish had become alive again and the mango a living one. Thus did the cunning wife save herself from her husbands wrath
Once upon a time an Indian lived all alone away up in the North where it snows and rains all the time and is very cold indeed. He went south and married a wife. He brought her to his home to keep him company but she soon died because of the cold.The Indian was so lonely after that that he went out in search of another wife. This time he went to the East. After he had been traveling for a long distance he went up on a hill and looked all around. He saw smoke so he went to see whence it came and he found a little house where a young girl lived all alone.Come in she said when he knocked on her door. She was lonely too so when the man asked her to go to live with him and be his wife she went.Soon after they reached the mans house away up north the man showed his wife where the corn was so that she could grind some into meal for bread while he went out to hunt to get meat for their dinner.The new wife sat down behind the grinding stones and tried to grind some of the corn but her fingers soon grew too stiff from the cold. She grew colder and colder and when the man came back from hunting he found her frozen to death.So again the man set out to find a third wife. This time he traveled to the West. He walked for many days until he came to a woman hoeing corn. He looked tired so the woman invited him to come into her house and rest a while. She called to her daughter to cook something for the stranger to eat. While he was eating he watched the young girl as she moved about the house and he liked her very much. When he finished his meal he asked the girlWont you go with me to my house in the north and be my wifeNo I am sorry but I do not wish to go she said. But her mother liked the stranger so she made her daughter go with him.While they were journeying northward the sadhearted girl heard some one calling her. She looked all around and finally she saw a turtle.Where are you going my sister asked Mrs. Turtle and why do you look so sadI am going into the cold Northland replied the girl to be the wife of that man walking in front of me. He is good to me but I am unhappy because I do not want to go and my mother has forced me to. I am afraid of the cold.Do not be unhappy and do not be afraid said Mrs. Turtle Take this herb with you and when you reach your new home make some tea of it and sprinkle the tea in all directions. The girl took the herb and journeyed on to her new home. When the man went out to hunt she did as Mrs. Turtle had told her and behold the house grew warm and comfortable and the girl was happy ever after.
It was evening in the badlands and the red sun had slipped behind the faroff hills. The sundown breeze bent the grasses in the coulees and curled tiny dustclouds on the barren knolls. Down in a gulch a clear cool creek dallied its way toward the Missouri where its water bitter as gall would be lost in the great stream. Here where Nature forbids man to work his will and where the she wolf dens and kills to feed her litter an aged Indian stood near the scattered bones of two great buffalobulls. Time had bleached the skulls and whitened the old warriors hair but in the solitude he spoke to the bones as to a boyhood friendHo Buffalo the years are long since you died and your tribe like mine was even then shrinking fast but you did not know it would not believe it though the signs did not lie. My father and his father knew your people and when one night you went away we thought you did but hide and would soon come back. The snows have come and gone many times since then and still your people stay away. The youngmen say that the great herds have gone to the Sand Hills and that my father still has meat. They have told me that the white man in his greed has killedand not for meatall the Buffalo that our people knew. They have said that the great herds that made the ground tremble as they ran were slain in a few short years by those who needed not. Can this be true when ever since there was a world our people killed your kind and still left herds that grew in numbers until they often blocked the rivers when they passed Our people killed your kind that they themselves might live but never did they go to war against you. Tell me do your people hide or are the youngmen speaking truth and have your people gone with mine to Sand Hill shadows to come back no moreHo red manmy people all have gone. The youngmen tell the truth and all my tribe have gone to feed among the shadowhills and your father still has meat. My people suffer from his arrows and his lance yet there the herds increase as they did here until the white man came and made his war upon us without cause or need. I was one of the last to die and with my brother here fled to this forbidding country that I might hide but one day when the snow was on the world a white murderer followed on our trail and with his noisy weapon sent our spirits to join the great shadowherds. Meat No he took no meat but from our quivering flesh he tore away the robes that Napa gave to make us warm and left us for the Wolves. That night they came and quarrelling fighting snapping mong themselves left but our bones to greet the morning sun. These bones the Coyotes and the weaker ones did drag and scrape and scrape again until the last of flesh or muscle disappeared. Then the winds came and sangand all was done.

Once upon a time all the animals declared war upon the birds. Each held a council of war to talk over what they should do.A tiny black ant slipped into the animals council and listened to their plans then he went to the birds and told themThe fox is to be the warchief of the animals and his tail is to be their signal. As long as the fox holds his tail up the animals are to go ahead and fight but as soon as the fox drops his tail down the animals are to run away.The eagle was warchief of the birds so he sent a messenger to bring in the bee to their council.Mrs. Bee said the eagle please sting the foxs tail for us so that we may win this war.Then the birds all flew away to meet and fight the animals. The little bee went and found the fox. The fox was leading the animals with his tail held up high. Mrs. Bee lit on his tail and began to sting it.She kept stinging and stinging until the fox could stand it no longer. He dropped his tail down and ran away with all of the animals following him. And the birds won the war.Author Note Laguna Pueblo
There once lived a king and queen who had an only daughter. And the beauty of this princess surpassed everything seen or heard of. Her forehead was brilliant as the moon her lips like the rose her complexion had the delicacy of the lily and her breath the sweetness of jessamine. Her hair was golden and in her voice and glance there was something so enchanting that none could help listening to her or looking at her.The princess lived for seventeen years in her own rooms rejoicing the heart of her parents teachers and servants. No one else ever saw her for the sons of the king and all other princes were forbidden to enter her rooms. She never went anywhere never looked upon the outside world and never breathed the outer air but she was perfectly happy.When she was eighteen it happened either by chance or by the will of fate that she heard the cry of the cuckoo. This sound made her strangely uneasy her golden head drooped and covering her eyes with her hands she fell into thought so deep as not to hear her mother enter. The queen looked at her anxiously and after comforting her went to tell the king about it.For many years past the sons of kings and neighbouring princes had either personally or by their ambassadors presented themselves at court to ask the king for the hand of his daughter in marriage. But he had always bidden them wait until another time. Now after a long consultation with the queen he sent messengers to foreign courts and elsewhere to proclaim that the princess in accordance with the wishes of her parents was about to choose a husband and that the man of her choice would also have the right of succession to the throne.When the princess heard of this decision her joy was very great and for days she would dream about it. Then she looked out into the garden through the golden lattice of her window and longed with an irresistible longing to walk in the open air upon the smooth lawn. With great difficulty she at last persuaded her governesses to allow her to do so they agreeing on condition that she should keep with them. So the crystal doors were thrown open the oaken gates that shut in the orchard turned on their hinges and the princess found herself on the green grass. She ran about picking the sweetscented flowers and chasing the manycoloured butterflies. But she could not have been a very prudent maiden for she wandered away from her governesses with her face uncovered.Just at that moment a raging hurricane such as had never been seen or heard before passed by and fell upon the garden. It roared and whistled round and round then seizing the princess carried her far away. The terrified governesses wrung their hands and were for a time speechless with grief. At last they rushed into the palace and throwing themselves on their knees before the king and queen told them with sobs and tears what had happened. They were overwhelmed with sorrow and knew not what to do.By this time quite a crowd of princes had arrived at the palace and seeing the king in such bitter grief inquired the reason of it.Sorrow has touched my white hairs said the king. The hurricane has carried off my dearly beloved child the sweet Princess with the Golden Hair and I know not where it has taken her. Whoever finds this out and brings her back to me shall have her for his wife and with her half my kingdom for a wedding present and the remainder of my wealth and titles after my death.After hearing these words princes and knights mounted their horses and set off to search throughout the world for the beautiful Princess with the Golden Hair who had been carried away by Vikher.Now among the seekers were two brothers sons of a king and they travelled together through many countries asking for news of the princess but no one knew anything about her. But they continued their search and at the end of two years arrived in a country that lies in the centre of the earth and has summer and winter at the same time.The princes determined to find out whether this was the place where the hurricane had hidden the Princess with the Golden Hair. So they began to ascend one of the mountains on foot leaving their horses behind them to feed on the grass. On reaching the top they came in sight of a silver palace supported on a cocks foot while at one of the windows the suns rays shone upon a head of golden hair surely it could only belong to the princess. Suddenly the north wind blew so violently and the cold became so intense that the leaves of the trees withered and the breath froze. The two princes tried to keep their footing and battled manfully against the storm but they were overcome by its fierceness and fell together frozen to death.Their brokenhearted parents waited for them in vain. Masses were said charities distributed and prayers sent up to God to pity them in their sorrow.One day when the queen the mother of the princes was giving a poor old man some money she said to him My good old friend pray God to guard our sons and soon bring them back in good health.Ah noble lady answered he that prayer would be useless. Everlasting rest is all one may ask for the dead but in return for the love you have shown and the money you have given the poor and needy I am charged with this messagethat God has taken pity on your sorrow and that ere long you will be the mother of a son the like of whom has never yet been seen.The old man having spoken thus vanished.The queen whose tears were falling felt a strange joy enter her heart and a feeling of happiness steal over her as she went to the king and repeated the old mans words. And so it came to pass for a week or two later God sent her a son and he was in no way like an ordinary child. His eyes resembled those of a falcon and his eyebrows the sables fur. His right hand was of pure gold and his manner and appearance were so full of an indescribable majesty that he was looked upon by every one with a feeling of awe.His growth too was not like that of other children. When but three days old he stepped out of his swaddlingclothes and left his cradle. And he was so strong that when his parents entered the room he ran towards them crying out Good morning dear parents why are you so sad Are you not happy at the sight of meWe are indeed happy dear child and we thank God for having sent us you in our great grief. But we cannot forget your two brothers they were so handsome and brave and worthy of a great destiny. And our sadness is increased when we remember that instead of resting in their own country in the tomb of their forefathers they sleep in an unknown land perhaps without burial. Alas it is three years since we had news of them.At these words the childs tears fell and he embraced his parents and said Weep no more dear parents you shall soon be comforted for before next spring I shall be a strong young man and will look for my brothers all over the world. And I will bring them back to you if not alive yet dead ay though I have to seek them in the very centre of the earth.At these words and at that which followed the king and queen were amazed. For the strange child guided as it were by an invisible hand rushed into the garden and in spite of the cold for it was not yet daylight bathed in the early dew. When the sun had risen he threw himself down near a little wood on the fine sand rubbed and rolled himself in it and returned home no longer a child but a youth.It was pleasant to the king to see his son thrive in this way and indeed the young prince was the handsomest in the whole land. He grew from hour to hour. At the end of a month he could wield a sword in two months he rode on horseback in three months he had grown a beautiful moustache of pure gold. Then he put on a helmet and presenting himself before the king and queen said My much honoured parents your son asks your blessing. I am no longer a child and now go to seek my brothers. In order to find them I will if necessary go to the furthest ends of the world.Ah do not venture. Stay rather with us dear son you are still too young to be exposed to the risks of such an undertaking.Adventures have no terrors for me replied the young hero I trust in God. Why should I for a moment hesitate to face these dangers Whatever Destiny has in store for us will happen whatever we may do to try to prevent it.So they agreed to let him go. Weeping they bade him farewell blessing him and the road he was to travel.A pleasant tale is soon told but events do not pass so quickly.The young prince crossed deep rivers and climbed high mountains till he came to a dark forest. In the distance he saw a cottage supported on a cocks foot and standing in the midst of a field full of poppies. As he made his ways towards it he was suddenly seized by an overpowering longing to sleep but he urged on his horse and breaking off the poppy heads as he galloped through the field came up close to the house. Then he called outLittle cot turn around on thy foot turn thou freeTo the forest set thy back let thy door be wide to me.The cottage turned round with a great creaking noise the door facing the prince. He entered and found an old woman with thin white hair and a face covered with wrinkles truly frightful to look upon. She was sitting at a table her head resting on her hands her eyes fixed on the ceiling lost in deep thought. Near her were two beautiful girls their complexions like lilies and roses and in every way sweet to the eye.Ah how do you do Prince with Moustache of Gold Hero with the Golden Fist said old Yaga what has brought you hereHaving told her the object of his journey she replied Your elder brothers perished on the mountain that touches the clouds while in search of the Princess with the Golden Hair who was carried off by Vikher the hurricane.And how is this thief Vikher to be got at asked the prince.Ah my dear child he would swallow you like a fly. It is now a hundred years since I went outside this cottage for fear Vikher should seize me and carry me off to his palace near the sky.I am not afraid of his carrying me off I am not handsome enough for that and he will not swallow me either for my golden hand can smash anything.Then if you are not afraid my dove I will help you to the best of my power. But give me your word of honour that you will bring me some of the Water of Youth for it restores even to the most aged the beauty and freshness of youth.I give you my word of honour that I will bring you some.This then is what you must do. I will give you a pincushion for a guide this you throw in front of you and follow whithersoever it goes. It will lead you to the mountain that touches the clouds and which is guarded in Vikhers absence by his father and mother the northern blast and the south wind. On no account lose sight of the pincushion. If attacked by the father the northern blast and suddenly seized with cold then put on this heatgiving hood if overpowered by burning heat of the south wind then drink from this cooling flagon. Thus by means of the pincushion the hood and the flagon you will reach the top of the mountain where the Princess with the Golden Hair is imprisoned. Deal with Vikher as you will only remember to bring me some of the Water of Youth.Our young hero took the heatgiving hood the cooling flagon and the pincushion and after bidding farewell to old Yaga and her two pretty daughters mounted his steed and rode off following the pincushion which rolled before him at a great rate.Now a beautiful story is soon told but the events of which it consists do not in real life take place so rapidly.When the prince had travelled through two kingdoms he came to a land in which lay a very beautiful valley that stretched into the far distance and above it towered the mountain that touches the sky. The summit was so high above the earth you might almost fancy it reached the moon.The prince dismounted left his horse to graze and having crossed himself began to follow the pincushion up steep and rocky paths. When he had got halfway there the north wind began to blow and the cold was so intense that the wood of the trees split up and the breath froze he felt chilled to the heart. But he quickly put on the heatgiving hood and criedO HeatGiving Hood see I fly now to theeLend me quickly thine aidO hasten to warm ere the cold has killed meWith thee Im not afraid.The northern blast blew with redoubled fury but to no purpose. For the prince was so hot that he streamed with perspiration and indeed was obliged to unbutton his coat and fan himself.Here the pincushion stopped upon a small snowcovered mound. The prince cleared away the snow beneath which lay the frozen bodies of two young men and he knew them to be those of his lost brothers. Having knelt beside them and prayed he turned to follow the pincushion which had already started and was rolling ever higher and higher. On reaching the top of the mountain he saw a silver palace supported on a cocks foot and at one of the windows shining in the suns rays a head of golden hair which could belong to no one but the princess. Suddenly a hot wind began to blow from the south and the heat became so intense that leaves withered and dropped from the trees the grass dried up and large cracks appeared in several places of the earths surface. Thirst heat and weariness began to tell upon the young prince so he took the cooling flagon from his pocket and criedFlagon bring me quick reliefFrom this parching heatIn thy draught I have beliefCoolness it will mete.After drinking deeply he felt stronger than ever and so continued to ascend. Not only was he relieved from the great heat but was even obliged to button up his coat to keep himself warm.The pincushion still led the way ever climbing higher and higher while the prince followed close behind. After crossing the region of clouds they came to the topmost peak of the mountain. Here the prince came close to the palace which can only be likened to a dream of perfect beauty. It was supported on a cocks foot and was built entirely of silver except for its steel gates and roof of solid gold. Before the entrance was a deep precipice over which none but the birds could pass. As the prince gazed upon the splendid building the princess leaned out of one of the windows and seeing him light shone from her sparkling eyes her lovely hair floated in the wind and the scent of her sweet breath filled the air. The prince sprang forward and cried outSilver Palace oh turn on thy foot turn thou freeTo the steep rocks thy back but thy doors wide to me.At these words it revolved creaking the doorway facing the prince. As he entered it returned to its original position. The prince went through the palace till he came to a room bright as the sun itself and the walls floor and ceiling of which consisted of mirrors. He was filled with wonder for instead of one princess he saw twelve all equally beautiful with the same graceful movements and golden hair. But eleven were only reflections of the one real princess. She gave a cry of joy on seeing him and running to meet him said Ah noble sir you look like a delivering angel. Surely you bring me good news. From what family city or country have you come Perhaps my dear father and mother sent you in search of meNo one has sent me I have come of my own free will to rescue you and restore you to your parents.When he had told her all that had passed she said Your devotion prince is very great may God bless your attempt. But Vikher the hurricane is unconquerable so if life be dear to you fly. Leave this place before his return which I expect every minute he will kill you with one glance of his eyes.If I should not succeed in saving you sweet princess life can be no longer dear to me. But I am full of hope and I beg you first to give me some of the StrengthGiving Water from the Heroic Well for this is drunk by the hurricane.The princess drew a bucketful of water which the young man emptied at one draught and then asked for another. This astonished her somewhat but she gave it him and when he had drunk it he said Allow me princess to sit down for a moment to take breath.She gave him an iron chair but directly he sat down it broke into a thousand pieces. She then brought him the chair used by Vikher himself but although it was made of the strongest steel it bent and creaked beneath the princes weight.Now you see said he that I have grown heavier than your unconquerable hurricane so take courage with Gods help and your good wishes I shall overcome him. In the meantime tell me how you pass your time here.Alas in bitter tears and sad reflections. My only consolation is that I have been able to keep my persecutor at a distance for he vainly implores me to marry him. Two years have now passed away and yet none of his efforts to win my consent have been successful. Last time he went away he told me that if on his return he had not guessed the riddles I set him the correct explanation of these being the condition I have made for his marrying me he would set them aside and marry me in spite of my objections.Ah then I am just in time. I will be the priest on that occasion and give him Death for a bride.At that moment a horrible whistling was heard.Be on your guard prince cried she here comes the hurricane.The palace spun rapidly round fearful sounds filled the building thousands of ravens and birds of ill omen croaked loudly and flapped their wings and all the doors opened with a tremendous noise.Vikher mounted on his winged horse that breathed fire leapt into the mirrored room then stopped amazed at the sight before him. He was indeed the hurricane with the body of a giant and the head of a dragon and as he gazed his horse pranced and beat his wings.What is your business here stranger he shouted and the sound of his voice was like unto a lions roar.I am your enemy and I want your blood replied the prince calmly.Your boldness amuses me. At the same time if you do not depart at once I will take you in my left hand and crush every bone in your body with my right.Try if you dare womanstealer he answered.Vikher roared breathing fire in his rage and with his mouth wide open threw himself upon the prince intending to swallow him. But the latter stepped lightly aside and putting his golden hand down his enemys throat seized him by the tongue and dashed him against the wall with such force that the monster bounded against it like a ball and died within a few moments shedding torrents of blood.The prince then drew from different springs the water that restores that revives and that makes young and taking the unconscious girl in his arms he led the winged horse to the door and saidSilver Palace oh turn on thy foot turn thou freeTo the steep rocks thy back the courtyard may I see.Whereupon the palace creaked round on the cocks foot and the door opened on the courtyard. Mounting the horse he placed the princess before him for she had by this time recovered from her swoon and criedFiery Horse with strength of wingI am now your lordDo my will in everythingBe your law my word.Where I point there you must goAt once at once. The way you know.And he pointed to the place where his brothers lay frozen in death. The horse rose pranced beat the air with his wings then lifting himself high in the air came down gently where the two princes were lying. The Prince with the Golden Hand sprinkled their bodies with the LifeRestoring Water and instantly the pallor of death disappeared leaving in its place the natural colour. He then sprinkled them with the Water that Revives after which they opened their eyes got up and looking round said How well we have slept but what has happened And how is it we see the lovely princess we sought in the society of a young man a perfect stranger to usThe Prince with the Golden Hand explained everything embraced his brothers tenderly and taking them with him on his horse showed the latter that he wished to go in the direction of Yagas cottage. The horse rose up pranced lifted himself in the air then beating his wings far above the highest forests descended close by the cottage. The prince saidLittle cot turn around on thy foot turn thou freeTo the forest thy back but thy door wide to me.The cottage began to creak without delay and turned round with the floor facing the travellers. Old Yaga was on the lookout and came to meet them. As soon as she got the Water of Youth she sprinkled herself with it and instantly everything about her that was old and ugly became young and charming. So pleased was she to be young again that she kissed the princes hands and said Ask of me anything you like I will refuse you nothing.At that moment her two beautiful young daughters happened to look out of the window upon which the two elder princes who were admiring them said Will you give us your daughters for wivesThat I will with pleasure said she and beckoned them to her. Then curtseying to her future sonsinlaw she laughed merrily and vanished. They placed their brides before them on the same horse while the Prince with the Golden Hand pointing to where he wished to go saidFiery Horse with strength of wingI am now your lordDo my will in everythingBe your law my word.Where I point there you must goAt once at once. The way you know.The horse rose up pranced flapped his wings and flew far above the forest. An hour or two later he descended before the palace of the GoldenHaired Princesss parents. When the king and queen saw their only daughter who had so long been lost to them they ran to meet her with exclamations of joy and kissed her gratefully and lovingly at the same time thanking the prince who had restored her to them. And when they heard the story of his adventures they said You Prince with the Golden Hand shall receive our beloved daughter in marriage with the half of our kingdom and the right of succession to the remainder after us. Let us too add to the joy of this day by celebrating the weddings of your two brothers.The Princess with the Golden Hair kissed her father lovingly and said My much honoured and noble sire and lord the prince my bridegroom knows of the vow I made when carried off by the hurricane that I would only give my hand to him who could answer aright my six enigmas it would be impossible for the Princess with the Golden Hair to break her word.The king was silent but the prince said Speak sweet princess I am listening.This is my first riddle Two of my extremities form a sharp point the two others a ring in my centre is a screw.A pair of scissors answered he.Well guessed. This is the second I make the round of the table on only one foot but if I am wounded the evil is beyond repair.A glass of wine.Right. This is the third I have no tongue and yet I answer faithfully I am not seen yet every one hears me.True. This is the fourth Fire cannot light me brush cannot sweep me no painter can paint me no hidingplace secure me.Sunshine.The very thing. This is the fifth I existed before the creation of Adam. I am always changing in succession the two colours of my dress. Thousands of years have gone by but I have remained unaltered both in colour and form.It must be time including day and night.You have succeeded in guessing the five most difficult the last is the easiest of all. By day a ring by night a serpent he who guesses this shall be my bridegroom.It is a girdle.Now they are all guessed said she and gave her hand to the young prince.They knelt before the king and queen to receive their blessing. The three weddings were celebrated that same evening and a messenger mounted the winged horse to carry the good news to the parents of the young princes and to bring them back as guests. Meanwhile a magnificent feast was prepared and invitations were sent to all their friends and acquaintances. And from that evening until the next morning they ceased not to feast and drink and dance. I too was a guest and feasted with the rest but though I ate and drank the wine only ran down my beard and my throat remained dry.
In 1770 the brig HandinHand went ashore at Good Luck New Jersey. Among the passengers on board the vessel that it would perhaps be wrong to call ill fated was John Murray founder of Universalism in America. He had left England in despair for his wife and children were dead and so broken was he in his power of thought and purpose that he felt as if he should never preach again.In fact his rescue from the wreck was passive on his part and he suffered himself to be carried ashore recking little whether he reached it or no. After he had been for half an hour or so on the soil of the new country to which he had made his entrance in so unexpected a manner he began to feel hungry and set off afoot along the desolate beach. He came to a cabin where an old man stood in a doorway with a basket of fish beside him. Will you sell me a fish asked Murray.No. The fish is all yours. I expected you.You do not know me.You are the man who is to tell us of God.I will never preach of Him again.I built that log church yonder. Dont say that you will not preach in it. Whenever a clergyman Presbyterian Methody or Baptist came here I asked him to preach in my kitchen. I tried to get him to stay but nohe always had work elsewhere. Last night I saw the brig driven on the bar and a voice said to me In that ship is the man who will teach of God. Not the old God of terrors but one of love and mercy. He has come through great sorrow to do this work. I have made ready for you. Do not go away.The minister felt a strange lifting in his heart. He fell on his knees before the little house and offered up a prayer. Long he staid in that place preaching gentle doctrines and ministering to the men and women of that lonely village and when the fisherman apostle Thomas Potter died he left the church to Murray who in turn bequeathed it free for the use of all Christian people.
The crane was a great fisherman. He used to hunt out the fish with his feet from underneath the logs in the creek and so catch numbers.One day when he had a great many on the bank of the creek a crow who was white at that time came up. He asked the crane to give him some fish.Wait a while said the crane until they are cooked.But the crow was hungry and impatient and would not cease bothering the crane who kept saying Wait. Wait.Presently the crane turned his back. The crow sneaked up and was just going to steal a fish. The crane turned round saw him seized a fish and hit the crow right across the eyes with it. The crow felt blinded for a few minutes. He fell on the burnt black grass round the fire and rolled over and over in his pain. When he got up to go away his eyes were white and the rest of him black as crows have been ever since.The crow was determined to pay out the crane for having given him white eyes and a black skin.So he watched his chance and one day when he saw the crane fast asleep he crept quietly up to him holding a fishbone. This he stuck right across the root of the cranes tongue.Then he went off as quietly as he had come careful for once to make no noise.The crane woke up at last and when he opened his mouth to yawn he felt like choking. He tried to get the obstruction out of his throat. In the effort he made a queer scraping noise which was all he could give utterance to. The bone stuck fast.And to this day the only noise a crane can make is gahrahgah gahrahgah This noise gives the name by which he is known to the blacks.
Long ago there was an old woman who had a son. She always advised him not to cause injury to any man and not to torture or kill any animal or beast no matter how despised it might be. They were very poor. The lad went to the forest every day and brought a bundle of wood on his back. He sold it for twopence and bought bread for his aged mother and himself. One day he saw that the village boys were torturing a kitten and taking pleasure in its cries.Why do you torture the poor animal said the lad to the boys let it go.Give us your pennies and we will let it go said the boys.He at once gave them the twopence which he had earned that day by selling his wood and took the kitten home with him. Both mother and son went to bed hungry that night. On the following day he took the kitten with him to the forest and that evening the bundle of wood was sold at fourpence. He paid twopence for bread and putting the other twopence in his pocket was returning home when he met the village boys who were this time torturing a mouse. The lad gave his twopence to the boys and took the mouse home with him. On the third day he saved a whelp of a dog and brought it home. On the fourth day he saved a little snake and putting it in a jug kept it at home. On the following day he took all the animals and went to the forest to cut wood. At noon he sat at a fountain to eat his lunch and gave a share of it to the animals. He took the snake out of the jug and let it go but the reptile would not leave him. He then gave it a piece of bread. As soon as it bit the bread lo it was changed into a pretty boy and said to the ladI am the son of the King of India magicians stole me and changed me into a snake. The enchantment was such that the moment a human being gave me bread to eat with his own hand I should again change into a boy. I escaped from the hands of the magicians and came to the village for the purpose of biting a piece of bread from a human hand but the village urchins found me and were about to kill me when you saved me. I owe you my life and my freedom from the magicians spell. Now let me advise you. When I go home to my father he will be so happy to see me that he will wish to reward you with the most precious things in his kingdom. But when he asks you to demand something from him be careful and request only the ring which he has on his finger. It is a magic ring and the moment you turn its jewel upsidedown two genii will wait on you to do your will and will bring for you anything that you may desire.The lad accompanied the boy to the court of the King of India who was so glad at the sight of his child that he was almost beside himself with joy. The boy told his father all that had happened and presented the lad as the deliverer of his life.Ask of me what you will said the King to the lad you have saved the heir apparent and I will give you whatever you demand even to the half of my kingdom.Long live the King said the lad. I desire only the ring on your finger.A plague upon him who advised you said the King you have demanded the costliest thing I have. But as I have promised I must give it to you.So saying he gave the ring to the lad and ordered his saddlebags to be filled with gold. The lad came back to his aged mother and told her what had happened.Well then son said the old woman let me go and ask our King to give you his daughter in marriage.The lad consented and the old woman after buying for herself a new dress and adorning herself as best she could went to the court.What do you want said the King.Long live the King said the old woman. I have come to ask you by Gods order to give your daughter in marriage to my son.Good said the King but has your son the equivalent of the dower that I can give to my daughterCertainly he has answered the woman how much do you want him to haveHe must have a treasure full of gold like mine and a magnificent palace like mine. The road between my palace and his must be covered with a single soft rug and on both sides shady trees must grow and under them horsemen ride from one end to the other on horses all milky white. If he can procure these I will give him my daughter in marriage if not I will not.The old woman returned and told the lad what the King had said. The lad turned the jewel of the ring and lo two genii presented themselves with their hands folded upon their breasts sayingTell us your will and we will do it immediately.The lad ordered them to prepare all that the King had demanded. Everything was ready in one night. On the following day the King was greatly pleased with the palace and everything in it and gave his daughter in marriage. There they lived in happiness until the death of the old woman.But there was a Jew who had heard of the magic ring and he was anxious to get it. He took on the shape of a peddler and came to the palace at a time when the lad had gone hunting and there was no one there besides the Princess. She opened the door to look at the goods of the peddler.I peddle nice goods for ladies said the clever Jew and in order to give ladies facility I do not care to sell them for money but exchange for old jewelry such as rings and the like. Any lady will have some old rings which she can give in return for beautiful goods.Let me see if we have rings at home which I can give you for your goods said the Princess.She went in and came back with the magic ring sayingHere I have found this among my husbands things I think it will do for you.The Jew gave some rubbish in exchange for the precious ring. As soon as he put it on his finger he turned the jewel and lo the two genii stood before him ready to do his commands.I wish you to take this palace with me in it and carry it to the Island of the Seven Seas and I wish you to throw the former owner into the unfathomable sea. He had hardly finished his words when the palace with the Princess and the Jew was transported to the Island of the Seven Seas. Then the genii seized the lad and were about to throw him into the bottomless sea when they took pity on him he being their former master and left him in a wilderness on the shore. This was a dreadful change for the youth. He traveled a long way and at length came to the hut of a fisherman who accepted him as an apprentice.But let us return to the animals. The dog the cat and the mouse seeing what misfortune had come to their master decided to go to the Island of the Seven Seas and getting the ring from the Jew take it to their master whom they knew by instinct to have become the apprentice of a fisherman. They immediately started and soon came to the sea. The dog entered the water the cat took her seat on his neck while the mouse rode on the cats back. The dog began to swim and proved to be an expert in the art.We hope our weight will not cause you to sink brother dog said the cat and the mouse.Pshaw said the dog proudly you are as light as a feather and speak of sinking me Nay be careful not to be blown away from my back by the wind of my respiration.And out of his mouth he hung his long tongue. So swimming at last they came to the Island of the Seven Seas where they saw their masters palace. It was night. The dog stood at the bottom of the wall while the cat with the mouse on her back climbed up until they came to the window. But as it was closed it was now the turn of the mouse to do his part. He gnawed the board with his fine teeth and opened a hole large enough for himself to go through. Entering he looked everywhere for the ring but it could not be found. The Jew was asleep.Look at the Jews fingers whispered the cat from without.But it was not there.Look in his mouth whispered the cat.The mouse made a careful examination and lo the ring was in the Jews mouth. But how to get it The mouse saw that the Jew had put his snuffbox near his bed. He first ran to the cellar and soaked his tail in vinegar then coming back he thrust it into the snuffbox. He repeated this several times until his tail was well stiffened with a coating of vinegar and snuff. He went then to the sleeping Jew and perching upon his beard thrust his tail into his nostril as far as it could go.This caused the Jew to sneeze with all his might and lo the ring was flung from his mouth. The mouse uttered a shriek of joy and snatching the ring from the floor in the twinkling of an eye disappeared through the hole. The Jew immediately arose and lighting a candle began to search for the ring. Not finding it he thought to look for it in the morning and again went to bed. The mouse and the cat descended the wall to their bigmouthed friend who was looking at them wistfully. The dog again entered the water the cat took her place on his back and the mouse rested on the cats back. They decided that the ring should be in the cats mouth. This time they began to swim toward the opposite shore of the sea where the lad was serving the fisherman. They crossed the Seven Seas and approached the shore safely. As soon as they saw the land and their masters hut the dog said to his companionsI am swimming for you but you have the ring. You will give it to master who will praise you while I who have worked the hardest will not receive any credit. Not so you must put the ring in my mouth before we reach the land.Brother dog said the cat now you are tired and see how you keep your mouth open all the time and stretch your tongue out. If we put the ring in your mouth we are afraid you will drop it into the sea. But as soon as we reach the land we will give the ring to you that you may give it to master.No said the dog you must give it now or else I will drop you into the sea.He began to shake them threatening to drown them. The cat therefore was obliged to place the ring in the dogs mouth. But he could not keep his mouth shut a single minute. He opened his mouth stretched his tongue began to pant and lo the ring fell into the sea. They came ashore but all in great excitement. The mouse and the cat began to beat the dog who thrust his tail between his hind legs as if to acknowledge his fault but had to defend himself against the sharp paws of the cat and the fine teeth of the mouse. Quarreling and howling and rolling upon the sand they came to the fishermans hut. The lad with his natural kindness to animals came out to separate the fighters and lo they were his own friends. Seeing the lad all three paid him their respects but again began to fight one another this time more severely. The youth seeing that it was impossible to leave them in this way provided three ropes and bound them separately. He gave them food and drink and tried to calm their anger. On the following day he drew out a net full of fishes and sat down to prepare them for market. Among them was a large fish. As soon as the lad seized it there was excitement among the animals. The dog barked the cat mewed and the mouse shrieked and all three tried to cut their ropes. The lad had hardly cut the fish open when the mouse having gnawed its rope ran and plunged into the belly of the fish and in the twinkling of an eye came out with the magic ring in its mouth for the fish had swallowed the ring. The mouse jumped upon his masters lap and presented the ring at sight of which the lad understood why the animals were troubled. He untied them and kissing the three expressed his gratitude for their brave enterprise. Then he turned the jewel and lo the two genii presented themselves.I want my palace to be restored to its place myself to be placed in it again and the Jew to be thrown into the bottomless sea said the lad.He had barely finished his sentence when he found himself and his animal friends in his palace once more and near him was his wife. The Jew was cast into the bottomless sea where he is sinking everlastingly but never reaches the bottom. Thus the wicked one was punished and the virtuous one attained his wishes. May Heaven grant that you may all be virtuous and attain your wishesThree apples fell from heaven one for me one for the storyteller and one for the man who entertained the company.
Once upon a time there was a girl who was to go to the wood and drive the cattle home but she did not find the herd and losing her way instead came to a great hill. It had gates and doors and she went in. There stood a table covered with all sorts of good things to eat. And there stood a bed as well and in the bed lay a great snake. The snake said to the girl Sit down if you choose Eat if you choose Come and lie down in the bed if you choose But if you do not choose then do not do so.So the girl did nothing at all. At last the snake said Some people are coming now who want you to dance with them.

Then they began to eat and drink but the girl left the hill and went home. The following day she again went to the wood to look for the cattle did not find them lost her way again and came to the same hill. This time she also entered and found everything as it had been the first time the wellspread table and the bed with the snake in it.And the snake said to her as before Sit down if you choose Eat if you choose Come and lie down in the bed if you choose But if you do not choose then do not do so Now a great many more people are coming who will want to dance with you but do not go with them.The snake had scarcely concluded before a great many people arrived who began to dance eat and drink but the girl did not keep them company instead she left the hill and went home.On the third day when she once more went to the wood everything happened exactly as on the first and second day. The snake invited her to eat and drink and this time she did so with a hearty appetite. Then the snake told her to lie down beside him and the girl obeyed. Then the snake said Put your arm about meShe did so. And now kiss me said the snake but if you are afraid put your apron between us.The girl did so and in a moment the snake was turned into a marvellously handsome youth who was really a prince bewitched in the form of a snake by magic spells and now delivered by the girls courage. Then both of them went away and there was nothing further heard of them.
Once upon a time a king had a son named Prince Wicked. He was fierce and cruel and he spoke to nobody without abuse or blows. Like grit in the eye was Prince Wicked to every one both in the palace and out of it.His people said to one another If he acts this way while he is a prince how will he act when he is king One day when the prince was swimming in the river suddenly a great storm came on and it grew very dark.In the darkness the servants who were with the prince swam from him saying to themselves Let us leave him alone in the river and he may drown.When they reached the shore some of the servants who had not gone into the river said Where is Prince Wicked Isnt he here they asked. Perhaps he came out of the river in the darkness and went home. Then the servants all went back to the palace.The king asked where his son was and again the servants said Isnt he here O King A great storm came on soon after we went into the water. It grew very dark. When we came out of the water the prince was not with us.At once the king had the gates thrown open. He and all his men searched up and down the banks of the river for the missing prince. But no trace of him could be found.In the darkness the prince had been swept down the river. He was crying for fear he would drown when he came across a log. He climbed upon the log and floated farther down the river. When the great storm arose the water rushed into the homes of a Rat and a Snake who lived on the river bank. The Rat and the Snake swam out into the river and found the same log the prince had found. The Snake climbed upon one end of the log and the Rat climbed upon the other.On the rivers bank a cottonwoodtree grew and a young Parrot lived in its branches. The storm pulled up this tree and it fell into the river. The heavy rain beat down the Parrot when it tried to fly and it could not go far. Looking down it saw the log and flew down to rest. Now there were four on the log floating down stream together. Just around the bend in the river a certain poor man had built himself a hut. As he walked to and fro late at night listening to the storm he heard the loud cries of the prince. The poor man said to himself I must get that man out of the water. I must save his life. So he shouted I will save you I will save you as he swam out in the river.Soon he reached the log and pushing it by one end he soon pushed it into the bank. The prince jumped up and down he was so glad to be safe and sound on dry land.Then the poor man saw the Snake the Rat and the Parrot and carried them to his hut. He built a fire putting the animals near it so they could get dry. He took care of them first because they were the weaker and afterwards he looked after the comfort of the prince. Then the poor man brought food and set it before them looking after the animals first and the prince afterwards. This made the young prince angry and he said to himself This poor man does not treat me like a prince. He takes care of the animals before taking care of me. Then the prince began to hate the poor man.A few days later when the prince and the Snake the Rat and the Parrot were rested and the storm was all over the Snake said goodby to the poor man with these wordsFather you have been very kind to me. I know where there is some buried gold. If ever you want gold you have only to come to my home and call Snake and I will show you the buried gold. It shall all be yours.Next the Rat said goodby to the poor man. If ever you want money said the Rat come to my home and call out Rat and I will show you where a great deal of money is buried near my home. It shall all be yours.Then the Parrot came saying Father silver and gold have I none but if you ever want choice rice come to where I live and call Parrot and I will call all my family and friends together and we will gather the choicest rice in the fields for you. Last came the prince. In his heart he hated the poor man who had saved his life. But he pretended to be as thankful as the animals had been saying Come to me when I am king and I will give you great riches. So saying he went away.Not long after this the princes father died and Prince Wicked was made king. He was then very rich.By and by the poor man said to himself Each of the four whose lives I saved made a promise to me. I will see if they will keep their promises.First of all he went to the Snake and standing near his hole the poor man called out Snake At once the Snake darted forth and with every mark of respect he said Father in this place there is much gold. Dig it up and take it all.Very well said the poor man. When I need it I will not forget. After visiting for a while the poor man said goodby to the Snake and went to where the Rat lived calling out Rat The Rat came at once and did as the Snake had done showing the poor man where the money was buried.When I need it I will come for it said the poor man. Going next to the Parrot he called out Parrot and the bird flew down from the treetop as soon as he heard the call. O Father said the Parrot shall I call together all my family and friends to gather choice rice for you The poor man seeing that the Parrot was willing and ready to keep his promise said I do not need rice now. If ever I do I will not forget your offer.Last of all the poor man went into the city where the king lived. The king seated on his great white elephant was riding through the city. The king saw the poor man and said to himself That poor man has come to ask me for the great riches I promised to give him. I must have his head cut off before he can tell the people how he saved my life when I was the prince.So the king called his servants to him and said You see that poor man over there Seize him and bind him beat him at every corner of the street as you march him out of the city and then chop off his head.The servants had to obey their king. So they seized and bound the poor man. They beat him at every corner of the street. The poor man did not cry out but he said over and over again It is better to save poor weak animals than to save a prince. At last some wise men among the crowds along the street asked the poor man what prince he had saved. Then the poor man told the whole story ending with the words By saving your king I brought all this pain upon myself.The wise men and all the rest of the crowd cried out This poor man saved the life of our king and now the king has ordered him to be killed. How can we be sure that he will not have any or all of us killed Let us kill him. And in their anger they rushed from every side upon the king as he rode on his elephant and with arrows and stones they killed him then and there.Then they made the poor man king and set him to rule over them. The poor man ruled his people well. One day he decided once more to try the Snake the Rat and the Parrot. So followed by many servants the king went to where the Snake lived.At the call of Snake out came the Snake from his hole saying Here O King is your treasure take it. I will said the king. And I want you to come with me. Then the king had his servants dig up the gold. Going to where the Rat lived the king called Rat Out came the Rat and bowing low to the king the Rat said Take all the money buried here and have your servants carry it away. I will said the king and he asked the Rat to go with him and the Snake.Then the king went to where the Parrot lived and called Parrot The Parrot flew down to the kings feet and said O King shall I and my family and my friends gather choice rice for you Not now not until rice is needed said the king. Will you come with us The Parrot was glad to join them.So with the gold and the money and with the Snake the Rat and the Parrot as well the king went back to the city. The king had the gold and the money hidden away in the palace. He had a tube of gold made for the Snake to live in. He had a glass box made for the Rats home and a cage of gold for the Parrot. Each had the food he liked best of all to eat every day and so these four lived happily all their lives.
Once upon a time there was a King who was very fond of hunting. He had extensive forests full of all kinds of game. But at the farthest boundaries of his dominions was a strip of land surrounded by steep hills which the people of the country considered enchanted ground because none who had gone thither for the purpose of hunting had ever returned. One day the King said to his noblemenLet us go and see what is there.His men asked him to be advised and not to go. But the King insisted they started upon the fatal journey and never came back. The King had two sons the eldest of whom succeeded him. One day the younger brother said to the new KingI will go and revenge my fathers death.The King tried to dissuade him but all in vain the lad insisted. He had some very faithful servants who said they would accompany him and they all set out upon the perilous journey. As soon as they entered the enchanted ground they saw a beautiful antelope running before them. They began to chase the animal which seemed to mock them with its graceful bounds over the bushes and rocks. They continued chasing it until late in the day when they came to a thick forest surrounded by steep rocks. The antelope leaped over the rocks and disappeared in the forest. But the hunters horses could go no farther and they all dismounted. They were surprised to find an elegant tent pitched among the trees beside a fountain of pure water. Entering the tent they saw a table spread with all kinds of delicious foods. They were very hungry and began to devour the food with ravenous appetites after that they quenched their thirst from the crystal waters of the fountain. But the lad never tasted the food or the water he thought to himself that there must be some deviltry at the bottom of this banquet. While his men gave themselves up to eating and drinking the lad occupied himself in examining the neighborhood. To his great terror he saw not far from the tent a heap of human skeletons bleached and showing their grinning teeth. What could these be if not the bones of those who from time to time had come to hunt in that enchanted ground and been lost Among these perchance were the bones of his own father. How could he have been killed With these thoughts he came back to the tent and to his great horror and grief saw that some of his men were already dead and others were breathing their last. He wished to help them but in vain they were soon as dead as stones. He could plainly see the cause both the food and the water were poisoned. He now understood how all human beings who hunted in this region were done away with and heaped up on the pile of skeletons. But who was the perpetrator of this devilish crime His blood began to boil and he determined to do battle with the perpetrator whether human being fairy or demon until he had revenged the victims of this diabolical plot. He was buried in this meditation when he heard the footsteps of approaching horsemen and he immediately withdrew to the depths of the forest bound his horse to a sycamore tree and concealed himself behind the bushes whence he could see the tent and the neighborhood without himself being perceived. Soon a number of horsemen arrived who appeared to be greatly pleased at seeing the dead men and at once began to strip them of their clothes. They loaded each mans property upon his own horse and prepared to drive the horses away. One of the riders who no doubt was their leader wore a complete suit of white armor had locks of long hair and a graceful countenance feminine in its beauty. The lad who was watching them closely took aim with his bow and arrow and was just about to shoot the leader in the forehead when he suddenly stopped.That is a woman he said to himself. I will not shoot at a woman. At once he jumped out from the place of his concealment and standing before the leader exclaimedAre you a human being a fairy or a demon Disclose yourself. To lead people astray and to destroy human life by poison are not the deeds of heroes. Come let me measure swords with you.These words of the lad at first called forth expressions of rage upon the countenance of the leader. But the next second the natural feminine grace again bloomed upon her cheeks and she answered with a sweet musical voice the sweetest that ever fell upon a human earYouth I spare your life provided that your heart is as brave as your words. Zoolvisia is my name. If you want to show your courage before me you must come where I live.And she spurred her horse and galloping disappeared behind the trees and rocks. The lad stood stonestill as if struck by lightning. The beauty of the horsewoman had charmed him her face was of light her hair of gold her horse of lightning. Was she a maidenZoolvisia Zoolvisia the lad exclaimed suddenly I will find you.And at once he mounted his horse and started in the direction whither Zoolvisia and her followers had gone. It was late in the evening the sun having long before disappeared behind the horizon. After groping his way in the darkness for a while he saw a light gleaming at a distance and turned his horse in that direction. When he arrived he saw a cave where a fairy woman was kneading dough.The goodness of the hour upon you mother said the lad.Heaven bless you son said the old dame. Neither the snake on its belly nor the bird with its wing could come here why did you venture to comeYour love brought me hither mother answered the lad.The fairy woman was pleased with the lad and said to himThe seven fairies my sons have just gone out ahunting they hunt all night long and come back in the morning. If they find you here they will devour you. Let me hide you.So speaking she hid the lad in a hole near the cave. At daybreak the seven fairies returned and smelling a human being exclaimedO mother last night you ate a human being have you not kept at least some bones for us to pickI have eaten no human being said their mother but my nephew the son of a human sister has come to visit us.Where is he mother we want to see our human cousin said the fairies.The old woman brought the lad out from the hole and presented him to the fairies who were much pleased with him and asked him the reason for his journey. The lad said that he was going after Zoolvisia.Zoolvisia exclaimed the seven brothers. Be advised cousin do not go. This is a most dangerous journey. Zoolvisia is a cruel tyrant. No human being who has ever undertaken this journey has returned. Come cousin stay with us be our elder brother we your subordinates and let us live together in happiness.No said the lad let come what may I will go. Thereupon he gave the seven brothers a pair of scissors sayingWhen you see blood dripping from the scissors know that I am in danger and come to my rescue.And he took leave of his adopted cousins. On his way he came to another cave where seven fairies lived with their mother the sister of the former fairy woman who accepted him as their cousin and tried to dissuade him from going. He gave to them a lookingglass sayingWhen you see the glass covered with sweat know that I am in trouble and hasten to my rescue.Then he came to a third abode where seven fairies lived with their mother who was a sister of the former two. They also accepted him as cousin and sought to dissuade him from going. He gave them a razor sayingWhen you see drops of blood falling from the edge of this razor know that my life is in danger and run to my rescue.Departing on his way he met an old monk in a cottage who also tried to dissuade him but as the lad insisted the monk saidLet me advise you Zoolvisia is the most beautiful maiden in the world. She is a princess endowed from above with a talisman. She has forty maids under her command who play the part of Amazons. She goes up to the top of the tower of her castle every morning at daybreak dressed in her robe of pearls. Thence she gazes all about her realm to see whether human beings or genii have trespassed upon her boundaries. Three times she cries out with a loud voice and all who have been on her ground on hearing her voice immediately drop dead as if struck by lightning. It is she who taking the shape of an antelope leads hunters astray and destroys them by poisonous food and water. Now do as I advise you. As soon as you reach the vicinity of her castle set up a stick and put on it your cloak and cap and dig a trench in the neighborhood and conceal yourself at the same time sealing both your ears with beeswax so that no sound can penetrate them. At the beginning of daybreak watch her on the top of the tower. Do not stir at her first nor second call but as soon as her third call is ended jump up from your place of concealment and stand before her. By this means you will break her talisman and subdue her.The lad thanked the old monk and continuing his journey soon saw at a distance Zoolvisias magnificent castle decorated with gold and jewels. He did just as the monk had advised him and at Zoolvisias third call jumped up and stood before her gazing at her. Zoolvisia recognized him and saidYou have overcome me you are brave and a real hero worthy of me. No one except you has ever heard my voice and lived. Now my talisman is broken and I have become a mere woman. Come in hero I and my forty maids will serve you.The lads heart began to yearn. All the hatred he cherished toward her who had perpetrated such terrible crimes had vanished. He had fallen in love with her and Zoolvisia on her part loved the lad. She let the rich locks of her golden hair hang down from the window. The lad approached took hold of them and kissed them and lo he was drawn up to the castle by them. They accepted one another as husband and wife and celebrated their wedding for forty days and nights. The forty maids served them. At the end of forty days Zoolvisia presented to the lad her horse of lightning. The animal seemed to be greatly pleased with his new master. The lad mounted the steed and prepared to go hunting when Zoolvisia gave him as a keepsake one of the locks of her hair in a pearl box. So the lad continued to hunt every day. One day as he was chasing a deer on the precipitous borders of the river the pearl box fell into the water and disappeared. The lad was sorry but he could not help it and came home without it. The pearl box was carried by the current of the river to the country of the King of the East where the Kings fishermen drew it from the water and took it to their master. The King opening the box was surprised to see the lock of golden hair. He called his noblemen and peers in council and placing the box before them saidYou must tell me whose hair this is. If you do not give me an answer in three days I will cut off your heads.Long live the King answered the men. In three days we will bring you word.Forthwith they sat in council and asked the advice of all the learned men and magicians of the country but in vain they could not solve the riddle within the three days. On the third day a witch hearing of the case came to the Kings noblemen sayingI can tell you what it is but what will you give meIf you save our heads said the noblemen every one of us will give you a handful of gold coins.The witch consented took the gold and told them of Zoolvisia and her golden hair. The men told the King what they had heard from the witch at the same time boasting that it was they who solved the riddle.Well then said the King I wish you to bring me Zoolvisia. I desire to marry her. I give you forty days grace if you do not bring her by that time I will cut off your heads.The men at once went to the witch sayingWitch it is only you who can accomplish this and save our heads. We will give you whatever you demand if you will bring Zoolvisia.The witch promised. Immediately she caught a score of snakes and putting them in a large pitcher corked its mouth. She then made a whip of a great black snake and mounting upon the pitcher gave it three blows. Thereupon the pitcher began to fly through the sky as if it had wings with the witch on its back. Soon she came to Zoolvisias garden and hiding the pitcher under the weeds she went and sat on the roadside where the lad would pass on his way from hunting. She had intentionally put on her torn dress and her worn and dusty shoes. In the evening the lad seeing her asked her who she was and how she had come there.O son the witch exclaimed with a pitiful voice may Heaven bless you I am a pilgrim to Jerusalem. I missed the caravan and went astray seeing your house at a distance I came to take rest. For Heavens sake give me bread and water and let me lodge with your dog at your gate.The lad had compassion on her and took her on the back of his horse. But the wise animal knew by instinct that she was a wicked woman and standing on his hind legs caused her to fall down.I will follow slowly son said the witch. Do you go ahead with your horse.Zoolvisia hearing that the lad had brought an old woman saidDont let her enter our house she may be a witch and bring calamity upon us.The lad gave orders to the maids to keep the old woman apart and not let her appear before Zoolvisia. But the witch was clever and soon won the favor of the maids who praised her before their mistress and asked her for the sake of merriment to summon her to her presence at least once. She consented and the witch was brought before her. The witch had a thousand and one ways of winning a young woman and she soon became a great favorite with Zoolvisia who could not spend an hour without her. One day she said to ZoolvisiaBlessed are you that have for a husband such a hero who encounters and overcomes all and himself is never destroyed. He discovered your secret broke your talisman and won your love. Of course you know his secret of bravery. May Heaven preserve his life But can you tell me what his secret isNo answered Zoolvisia I dont know what his secret is.What sort of a husband and wife are you said the witch scornfully. He knows your secret and you do not know his and he says he loves you. Strange strangeThese words were enough to excite the curiosity of Zoolvisia who in the evening again and again importuned the lad until he was induced to tell her that the secret of his bravery was his magic dagger which he carried in his belt in daytime and put under his pillow at night. As soon as that dagger was taken away he would lose all his power. With that they exchanged vows that nobody should know the secret and also they exchanged rings as a sign to be true to one another even to death. But woman is frail. On the following day Zoolvisia told the secret to the witch addingI have told you this to show you how my husband loves me from his heart.But she did not tell her anything in regard to the vows and exchange of rings. On that night the witch using her craft caused a heavy sleep to fall on all the inmates of the house. At midnight she entered the lads room and taking the magic dagger from under his pillow threw it from the window into the neighboring pond. Then she went to bed and pretended to sleep. In the morning Zoolvisia and the maids saw that their master did not rise. They entered the room and lo the lad had fallen from his bed and lay benumbed foaming at the mouth. They called him but there was no answer.Look under the pillow and see whether the magic dagger is there exclaimed Zoolvisia. They looked and lo it had been stolen. Then they all began to wail and cry. Thereupon the witch came in to see if the lad were really dead. She beat her breast she beat her knees she pulled her hair crying and yelling all the time. Then she went out brought the pitcher to the door of the castle and reentered surrounded by scores of snakes which were hissing with their forked tongues. All were stricken with terror and began to scream and yell. She bade the snakes bite the maidens who all fell down in a swoon. Then she said to ZoolvisiaNow you must obey me and come with me else I will set on you all these snakes which will bite you and tear you into pieces.Zoolvisia was terrified and mute. The witch pushed her down the stairs and thrusting her into the pitcher shut its mouth. She then mounted the pitcher and gave three strokes with the snake whip which caused it to fly. She alighted in the country of the King of the East and taking Zoolvisia out gave her to the Kings ministers who paid her with a horseload of gold. Zoolvisia was taken to the Kings palace.Let us return to the lad. The twentyone fairies the lads adopted cousins seeing that blood was dripping from the scissors and the razor and that the lookingglass was covered with sweat understood that their human kinsman was in danger and hastened to his rescue. Reaching the castle they saw the lad still in a torpor and the maids covered with snakes. On killing the snakes all the maids revived and told the fairies what had happened. They looked everywhere for the dagger but in vain. In the evening they were all hungry but there was nothing at home to eat. The fairies seeing that large fishes were swimming in the pond dove in and threw the fishes ashore. A great fish being thrown ashore was divided into two halves and lo the magic dagger fell out. The fish had swallowed it. The moment the dagger was put under the lads pillow he jumped up washed himself and was surprised to see that his fairy cousins had come. They told him everything. Immediately he ran to the stable. The horse was there but in a pitiable condition it had neither eaten nor drunk it had fallen in the dust. As soon as the animal saw the lad and smelled him it jumped up neighing. The lad gave it food to eat and water to drink brushed it clean and kissing it on the forehead saidO my wise horse you foresaw the calamity by your unerring instinct for you threw the hag from your back and lo what she has brought upon us. Now let us go after Zoolvisia.The animal as if understanding what the lad said neighed and beat the ground with its hoofs and seemed to say Yes let us go I am ready to go.The lad came back to the castle gave to the maidens many precious presents and sent them away free. He gave the castle and the treasures in it to the fairies himself taking only his saddlebags full of gold coins. He mounted the horse and went down the river until he came to the city of the King of the East. He stopped before the cottage of an old woman on the outskirts of the city and knocked at the door.Have you a nights lodging for me mother asked the lad.No master I have no place for you answered the dame. You had better go elsewhere.Here is something for you said the lad giving her a handful of gold. You are the crown of my head son exclaimed the old woman. I have room both for you and your horse.The lad entered in to lodge. After the meal he asked the old woman in regard to the news in the city and was told that Zoolvisia was in the Kings palace where for thirtyfive days there had been a wedding festival and after five days she would be married to the King. But she had said to the King that she did not wish to marry him as she was the wife of some one else and that rather than to be forced to it she would die by drinking poison which she had ready in her hand. She therefore received nobody.Well well mother that is enough said the lad. You keep a secret dont youOh better than you desire answered the old woman.Here is another handful of gold coins said the lad go to the market place and buy a suit of costly garments. Put them on and go and see Zoolvisia. Take this ring put it on your finger and show it to her then bring me word what she says.The old woman did just as he had told her. The palace servants thought she was the wife of the prime minister and told Zoolvisia that the greatest lady in the realm had come to visit her.I dont want her I dont cried Zoolvisia let her not come near me.The old woman did not pay any attention to the words of the servants who told her that Zoolvisia did not want to see her but pushed on and opened the door of the room where Zoolvisia was confined and held the ring before her eyes. As soon as Zoolvisia caught a glance of the ring she became as tame as a lamb.You are welcome kind lady she exclaimed with her sweet voice please be seated and she shut the door. When they were alone she saidWhere is the owner of that ring motherHe is a guest in my house replied the woman and is waiting to know your will.Go tell him said Zoolvisia to rest for three days. Do you immediately go to the King and say that you have persuaded me to become his wife. Let him be of good cheer. On the third day I shall go for recreation to the public garden. It is the business of your guest to do the rest. FarewellFarewell said the old woman and went directly to the Kings apartment saying proudly that she had persuaded Zoolvisia who early on the third day would go to the public garden for recreation and when she returned would become his wife. The King was delighted and gave the old woman costly presents. She came and told her guest all that had happened. Early on the third day as Zoolvisia had gone to the public garden with great pomp the lad came on the back of his horse like a flash of lightning put his arm about Zoolvisias waist and in the twinkling of an eye disappeared. The crowd thought it was a hurricane and all were stricken with terror. As soon as the King and his men realized the fact that she had been taken away they mounted their horses and started in pursuit of the unknown horseman. The lad having put Zoolvisia in a safe place came back with his horse of lightning killed the King and his favorites with his magic dagger and told the crowd in the public garden who he was. The people who were tired of their tyrannical King prayed that he would become their King and Zoolvisia their Queen. The lad went and brought Zoolvisia back. A crowd conducted them with great pomp to the throne where they are still reigning as King and Queen.Three apples fell from heaven one for me one for the storyteller and one for him who entertained the company.
Long long ago there was a large plain called Adachigahara in the province of Mutsu in Japan. This place was said to be haunted by a cannibal goblin who took the form of an old woman. From time to time many travelers disappeared and were never heard of more and the old women round the charcoal braziers in the evenings and the girls washing the household rice at the wells in the mornings whispered dreadful stories of how the missing folk had been lured to the goblins cottage and devoured for the goblin lived only on human flesh. No one dared to venture near the haunted spot after sunset and all those who could avoided it in the daytime and travelers were warned of the dreaded place.One day as the sun was setting a priest came to the plain. He was a belated traveler and his robe showed that he was a Buddhist pilgrim walking from shrine to shrine to pray for some blessing or to crave for forgiveness of sins. He had apparently lost his way and as it was late he met no one who could show him the road or warn him of the haunted spot.He had walked the whole day and was now tired and hungry and the evenings were chilly for it was late autumn and he began to be very anxious to find some house where he could obtain a nights lodging. He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain and looked about in vain for some sign of human habitation.At last after wandering about for some hours he saw a clump of trees in the distance and through the trees he caught sight of the glimmer of a single ray of light. He exclaimed with joyOh. surely that is some cottage where I can get a nights lodgingKeeping the light before his eyes he dragged his weary aching feet as quickly as he could towards the spot and soon came to a miserablelooking little cottage. As he drew near he saw that it was in a tumbledown condition the bamboo fence was broken and weeds and grass pushed their way through the gaps. The paper screens which serve as windows and doors in Japan were full of holes and the posts of the house were bent with age and seemed scarcely able to support the old thatched roof. The hut was open and by the light of an old lantern an old woman sat industriously spinning.The pilgrim called to her across the bamboo fence and saidO Baa San old woman good evening I am a traveler Please excuse me but I have lost my way and do not know what to do for I have nowhere to rest tonight. I beg you to be good enough to let me spend the night under your roof.The old woman as soon as she heard herself spoken to stopped spinning rose from her seat and approached the intruder.I am very sorry for you. You must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely spot so late at night. Unfortunately I cannot put you up for I have no bed to offer you and no accommodation whatsoever for a guest in this poor placeOh that does not matter said the priest all I want is a shelter under some roof for the night and if you will be good enough just to let me lie on the kitchen floor I shall be grateful. I am too tired to walk further tonight so I hope you will not refuse me otherwise I shall have to sleep out on the cold plain. And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay.She seemed very reluctant but at last she saidVery well I will let you stay here. I can offer you a very poor welcome only but come in now and I will make a fire for the night is cold.The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told. He took off his sandals and entered the hut. The old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire and bade her guest draw near and warm himself.You must be hungry after your long tramp said the old woman. I will go and cook some supper for you. She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice.After the priest had finished his supper the old woman sat down by the fireplace and they talked together for a long time. The pilgrim thought to himself that he had been very lucky to come across such a kind hospitable old woman. At last the wood gave out and as the fire died slowly down he began to shiver with cold just as he had done when he arrived.I see you are cold said the old woman I will go out and gather some wood for we have used it all. You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone.No no said the pilgrim let me go instead for you are old and I cannot think of letting you go out to get wood for me this cold nightThe old woman shook her head and saidYou must stay quietly here for you are my guest. Then she left him and went out.In a minute she came back and saidYou must sit where you are and not move and whatever happens dont go near or look into the inner room. Now mind what I tell youIf you tell me not to go near the back room of course I wont said the priest rather bewildered.The old woman then went out again and the priest was left alone. The fire had died out and the only light in the hut was that of a dim lantern. For the first time that night he began to feel that he was in a weird place and the old womans words Whatever you do dont peep into the back room aroused his curiosity and his fear.What hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see For some time the remembrance of his promise to the old woman kept him still but at last he could no longer resist his curiosity to peep into the forbidden place.He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room. Then the thought that the old woman would be very angry with him if he disobeyed her made him come back to his place by the fireside.As the minutes went slowly by and the old woman did not return he began to feel more and more frightened and to wonder what dreadful secret was in the room behind him. He must find out.She will not know that I have looked unless I tell her. I will just have a peep before she comes back said the man to himself.With these words he got up on his feet for he had been sitting all this time in Japanese fashion with his feet under him and stealthily crept towards the forbidden spot. With trembling hands he pushed back the sliding door and looked in. What he saw froze the blood in his veins. The room was full of dead mens bones and the walls were splashed and the floor was covered with human blood. In one corner skull upon skull rose to the ceiling in another was a heap of arm bones in another a heap of leg bones. The sickening smell made him faint. He fell backwards with horror and for some time lay in a heap with fright on the floor a pitiful sight. He trembled all over and his teeth chattered and he could hardly crawl away from the dreadful spot.How horrible he cried out. What awful den have I come to in my travels May Buddha help me or I am lost. Is it possible that that kind old woman is really the cannibal goblin When she comes back she will show herself in her true character and eat me up at one mouthfulWith these words his strength came back to him and snatching up his hat and staff he rushed out of the house as fast as his legs could carry him. Out into the night he ran his one thought to get as far as he could from the goblins haunt. He had not gone far when he heard steps behind him and a voice crying Stop stopHe ran on redoubling his speed pretending not to hear. As he ran he heard the steps behind him come nearer and nearer and at last he recognized the old womans voice which grew louder and louder as she came nearer.Stop stop you wicked man why did you look into the forbidden roomThe priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew over the ground faster than ever. Fear gave him strength for he knew that if the goblin caught him he would soon be one of her victims. With all his heart he repeated the prayer to BuddhaNamu Amida Butsu Namu Amida Butsu.And after him rushed the dreadful old hag her hair flying in the wind and her face changing with rage into the demon that she was. In her hand she carried a large bloodstained knife and she still shrieked after him Stop stopAt last when the priest felt he could run no more the dawn broke and with the darkness of night the goblin vanished and he was safe. The priest now knew that he had met the Goblin of Adachigahara the story of whom he had often heard but never believed to be true. He felt that he owed his wonderful escape to the protection of Buddha to whom he had prayed for help so he took out his rosary and bowing his head as the sun rose he said his prayers and made his thanksgiving earnestly. He then set forward for another part of the country only too glad to leave the haunted plain behind him.
Once there lived a certain king who understood the language of all birds and beasts and insects. This knowledge had of course been given him by a fairy godmother but it was rather a troublesome present for he knew that if he were ever to reveal anything he had thus learned he would turn into a stone. How he managed to avoid doing so long before this story opens I cannot say but he had safely grown up to manhood and married a wife and was as happy as monarchs generally are.This king I must tell you was a Hindu and when a Hindu eats his food he has a nice little place on the ground freshly plastered with mud and he sits in the middle of it with very few clothes on  which is quite a different way from ours.Well one day the king was eating his dinner in just such a nice clean mudplastered spot and his wife was sitting opposite to wait upon him and keep him company. As he ate he dropped some grains of rice upon the ground and a little ant who was running about seeking a living seized upon one of the grains and bore it off towards his hole. Just outside the kings circle this ant met another ant and the king heard the second one sayOh dear friend do give me that grain of rice and get another one for yourself. You see my boots are so dirty that if I were to go upon the kings eating place I should defile it and I cant do that it would be so very rude.But the owner of the grain of rice only repliedIf you want rice go and get it. No one will notice your dirty boots and you dont suppose that I am going to carry rice for all our kindred Then the king laughed.The queen looked at herself up and down but she could not see or feel anything in her appearance to make the king laugh so she saidWhat are you laughing at Did I laugh  replied the king.Of course you did retorted the queen and if you think that I am ridiculous I wish you would say so instead of behaving in that stupid way  What are you laughing at Im not laughing at anything answered the king.Very well but you did laugh and l want to know why.Well Im afraid I cant tell you said the king.You must tell me replied the queen impatiently. If you laugh when theres nothing to laugh at you must be ill or mad. What is the matter Still the king refused to say and still the queen declared that she must and would know. For days the quarrel went on and the queen gave her husband no rest until at last the poor man was almost out of his wits and thought that as life had become for him hardly worth living while this went on he might as well tell her the secret and take the consequences.But thought he if I am to become a stone I am not going to lie if I can help it on some dusty highway to be kicked here and there by man and beast flung at dogs be used as the plaything of naughty children and become generally restless and miserable. I will be a stone at the bottom of the cool river and roll gently about there until I find some secure restingplace where I can stay for ever.So he told his wife that if she would ride with him to the middle of the river he would tell her what he had laughed at. She thought he was joking and laughingly agreed their horses were ordered and they set out.On the way they came to a fine well beneath the shade of some lofty widespreading trees and the king proposed that they should get off and rest a little drink some of the cool water and then pass on. To this the queen consented so they dismounted and sat down in the shade by the wellside to rest.It happened that an old goat and his wife were browsing in the neighbourhood and as the king and queen sat there the nanny goat came to the wells brink and peering over saw some lovely green leaves that sprang in tender shoots out of the side of the well.Oh  cried she to her husband come quickly and look. Here are some leaves which make my mouth water come and get them for me Then the billy goat sauntered up and looked over and after that he eyed his wife a little crossly.You expect me to get you those leaves do you  I suppose you dont consider how in the world I am to reach them  You dont seem to think at all if you did you would know that if I tried to reach those leaves I should fall into the well and be drowned Oh cried the nanny goat why should you fall in  Do try and get them I am not going to be so silly replied the billy goat.But the nanny goat still wept and entreated.Look here said her husband there are plenty of fools in the world but I am not one of them. This silly king here because he cant cure his wife of asking questions is going to throw his life away. But I know how to cure you of your follies and Im going to.And with that he butted the nanny goat so severely that in two minutes she was submissively feeding somewhere else and had made up her mind that the leaves in the well were not worth having.Then the king who had understood every word laughed once more.The queen looked at him suspiciously but the king got up and walked across to where she sat.Are you still determined to find out what I was laughing at the other day  he asked.Quite answered the queen angrily.Because said the king tapping his leg with his riding whip Ive made up my mind not to tell you and moreover I have made up my mind to stop you mentioning the subject any more.What do you mean asked the queen nervously.Well replied the king I notice that if that goat is displeased with his wife he just butts her and that seems to settle the question Do you mean to say you would beat me  cried the queen.I should be extremely sorry to have to do so replied the king but I have to persuade you to go home quietly and to ask no more silly questions when I say I cannot answer them. Of course if you will persist why And the queen went home and so did the king and it is said that they are both happier and wiser than ever before.
The quiet town of Orrington in Maine was founded by Jesse Atwood of Wellfleet Cape Cod in 1778 and has become known since then as a place where skilful farmers and brave sailors could always be found. It also kept Maine supplied for years with oldest inhabitants. It is said that the name was an accident of illiteracy and that it is the only place in the world that owes its title to bad spelling. The settlers who followed Atwood there were numerous enough to form a township after ten years and the name they decided on for their commonwealth was Orangetown so called for a village in Maryland where some of the people had associations but the clerk of the town meeting was not a college graduate and his spelling of Orange was Orring and of town ton. His draft of the resolutions went before the legislature and the people directly afterward found themselves living in Orrington.
Jan and Jannette were brother and sister. They lived near a big wood and every day they used to go to play there fishing for sticklebacks in the streams and making necklaces of red berries. One day they wandered farther from their home than usual and all of a sudden they came to a brook crossed by a pretty red bridge. On the other side of the bridge half hidden among the trees they espied the roofs of a little pink cottage which when they came closer they found to be built entirely of sugarcandy Here was a delightful find for a little boy and girl who loved sweetstuff They lost no time in breaking off pieces of the roof and popping them into their mouths.Jan and Jannette. Illustration by Jean de Bosschre published in Folk Tales of Beasts and Men by Jean de Bosschre 1918. Dodd Mead and Company.Now in that house there lived an old wolf whose name was Garon. He was paralysed in one leg and could not run very fast but in all other respects he was as fierce and strong as he had been in his youth. When he heard Jan and Jannette breaking off bits of his roof he growled out Who is touching my SugarCandy House Then he came limping out to see who it was but by that time the children were safely hidden in the woods.Who dares to touch my SugarCandy House roared the wolf again.Then Jan repliedThis satisfied the old wolf and back he went to his house grumbling.The next day Jan and Jannette once again crossed over the little red bridge and broke some more candy from the wolfs house. Out came Garon again bristling all over.Who is touching my SugarCandy House he roared.And Jan and Jannette repliedVery well said the wolf and he went back again but this time there was a gleam of suspicion in his eye.The next day was stormy and hardly had Jan and Jannette reached the SugarCandy House than the wolf came out and surprised them in the very act of breaking a piece off his windowsill.Oho said he. It was the wind so mild was it That lovable child eh Precious lovable children I must say Grrr Ill eat them up And he sprang at Jan and Jannette who took to their heels and ran off as fast as their legs could carry them. Garon pursued them at a good speed in spite of his stiff paw and although he never gained upon them yet he kept them in sight and refused to give up the chase. The children looked back once or twice and saw that the wolf was still following them but they were not very much afraid because they were confident of their ability to outrun him.All of a sudden they found their way barred by a river. There was no bridge across it and the water was very deep. What were they to do Nearer and nearer came the wolfIn the middle of the river some ducks were swimming and Jan called out to them Little ducks Little ducks Carry us over the river on your backs for if you do not the wolf will get usSo the ducks came swimming up and Jan and Jannette climbed each on to the back of one and were carried safely over to the other bank.Presently the wolf in his turn came to the river. He had seen how the children had managed to cross and he roared out at the ducks in a terrible voice Come and carry me over or Ill eat you all upVery well answered the ducks and they swam to the bank and Garon balanced himself on four of them one paw on the back of each. But they had no intention of carrying the wicked old wolf to the other side for they did not love him or any of his tribe and moreover they objected to his impolite way of asking a favour. So at a given signal from the leader all the ducks dived in midstream and left old Garon struggling in the water. Three times he went down and three times he came up but the fourth time he sank never to rise any more.That was the end of old Garon and a good job too say I. I dont know what became of his SugarCandy House but I dare say if you could find the wood and the sun had not melted the candy or the rain washed it away you might break a bit of it off for yourselves.
